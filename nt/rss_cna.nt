REUTERS/Stephanie Keith REUTERS: Bank of America Corp will more clearly disclose the fees it charges clients of its Merrill Lynch wealth management business, according to a statement from bank spokeswoman Susan McCabe. The change, encompassing a range of services such as trading commissions, ATM usage and investment advice, will begin when the bank mails out January client statements in a few days. 'The enhancements are being made based on what our clients are telling us they'd like to see,' McCabe said in the statement. Brokerage firms are under more pressure to show that they are acting in their clients' best interest as a result of a Department of Labor rule on retirement advice set to go into effect in April. While some observers expect the Trump administration to pare back the rule or scrap it entirely, certain firms are choosing nonetheless to be more transparent about how they charge their clients. 'If there is a delay we look forward to working with the new administration, the new Secretary of Labor, and other relevant agencies to improve current rules and regulations for the benefit of our clients,' said Merrill Lynch wealth management head Andy Sieg, in a statement. Bloomberg News first reported on the change.

Posted 01 Feb 2017 08:40 Updated 01 Feb 2017 10:45 A bank employee counts U.S. dollar notes at a Kasikornbank in Bangkok, Thailand, May 12, 2016. REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha NEW YORK/LONDON: U.S. President Donald Trump and a top economics adviser on Tuesday unleashed a barrage of criticism against Germany, Japan and China, saying the three key U.S. trading partners were engaged in devaluing their currencies to the harm of American companies and consumers. The comments from Trump at the end of a White House meeting with pharmaceutical executives, as well as from trade adviser Peter Navarro in a newspaper interview, were the starkest indication yet that the first-term Republican president is prepared to jettison two decades of 'strong dollar' policies advocated by predecessors dating back to the Clinton administration. The criticism also signals a weakening of the U.S. commitment to an agreement among the financial leaders of the world's top 20 economies, struck after the 2008 financial crisis, that countries would not pursue policies to target exchange rates for competitive purposes. 'Those comments, talking about somebody else's currency, talking about valuation, almost seem like they're criticizing the construction of the euro zone which is a whole other issue,' said Greg Anderson, Global head of FX strategy for BMO Capital Markets in New York. 'I'm sure a lot of people have those thoughts. In the gentleman's agreement, as an official you don't mention those thoughts.' Trump and Navarro's remarks are just the latest to deepen a growing unease in financial markets about the outlook for global trade in the Trump era and sent the U.S. dollar into a tailspin against the euro and yen on Tuesday. A broad measure of the dollar against the currencies of key trading partners sank by 0.85 percent to cap a 2.6 percent decline in January, its weakest monthly showing since last March. The market convulsions began when Navarro, who heads Trump's newly created National Trade Council, told the Financial Times newspaper that the euro was like an 'implicit Deutsche Mark' whose low valuation gave Germany an edge over the United States and its European Union partners. That propelled the euro up about 0.5 percent against the U.S. dollar and drew a rebuff from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said the country respects the independence of the European Central Bank. Some blame the ECB for engineering an ultra-loose monetary policy in order to keep the trading bloc's common currency weak and stimulate economic growth in the euro-zone. 'Germany is a country that has always called for the European Central Bank to pursue an independent policy, just as the Bundesbank did before the euro existed,' Merkel told a news conference in Stockholm with Swedish Prime Minister StefanLofven. Hours later, Trump added his own critique of Japan and China to the mix, veering from discussing drug prices to currency valuations as he wrapped up a meeting with the heads of six top pharmaceuticals companies whom he is pressuring to lower prices. Bemoaning the fact that so many drug makers had relocated outside the United States, Trump blamed U.S. regulations and contended other countries 'take advantage of us with their money and their money supply and devaluation.' 'Every other country lives on devaluation,' he said. 'You look at what China's doing, you look at what Japan has done over the years. They - they play the money market, they play the devaluation market and we sit there like a bunch of dummies.' Japan's yen gained more than 1.0 percent against the dollar following Trump's off-the-cuff comments. With on-shore Chinese markets closed for a week for the lunar New Year holiday in Asia, reaction in its currency was limited to the off-shore market. The off-shore yuan surged by around 0.3 percent on Tuesday. Capital outflows have seen the yuan decline steadily in the past couple of years taking it back to levels last seen during the 2008 financial crisis. Trump's and Navarro's bluster against trading partners' currencies added to uncertainty in markets about the future of a U.S. 'strong dollar' policy. 'We sense the strong dollar policy is over, a thing of the past,' said Neil Jones, head of hedge fund FX sales at Mizuho inLondon. 'Recent U.S. concern over the strong dollar versus China is now feeding into the euro zone with these comments on an undervalued euro.' Investors have long looked to the U.S. Treasury Secretary as the main voice for guiding markets on dollar policy, and since Robert Rubin in the Clinton administration they have repeated the mantra that a strong dollar is in the interests of the United States. Trump's own nominee to head the U.S. Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, tried to maintain that tricky balance at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee earlier this month. He said Trump's earlier remarks on dollar strength referred to a short-term spikes due to market factors, not its longer-term value. 'The long-term strength over long periods of time is important' for the dollar, Mnuchin said. Now, however, markets have new voices to track on the matter: Trump and Navarro, a trade protectionist and China hawk whose role is still unclear to many investors. 'It’s all new stuff,' said BMO's Anderson. 'This hasn't been done before. Its maybe a little unsettling for the market.'

REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins NEW YORK: U.S. airline and online booking agency shares slumped for the second consecutive day on Tuesday, and some industry executives have begun speaking out against the Trump administration's ban on travel from seven majority Muslim nations. Share prices of major U.S. airlines and third-party travel booking sites have plunged since Friday when President Donald Trump issued an order temporarily barring entry to the United States from nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries. Confusion over who was affected, and protests at some major airports, disrupted travel throughout the weekend. American Airlines Group Inc  shares dropped 2.1 percent on Tuesday to US$43.96. United Continental Holdings Inc  stock price slipped 2.89 percent to US$69.65. American Airlines Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker, in a memo sent to employees on Monday and posted on a company website, called the order 'divisive' and said that it had caused 'difficult operating conditions' for some employees. 'As a global employer, however, this Executive Order does not affect the values that this company is built upon — those of diversity, inclusiveness and tolerance,' Parker said in the memo. Shares in Delta Air Lines Inc  declined for a second day on Tuesday and were down about 5 percent since Friday. Delta has declined to comment on the travel ban or the president's effort on Monday to pin blame for weekend travel delays on a computer outage that grounded some Delta flights on Sunday evening. The company did issue a statement on Tuesday congratulating Elaine Chao, Trump's nominee to run the Department of Transportation, on her confirmation. Share prices of online travel agencies Expedia Inc   and Priceline Group Inc  also fell in afternoon trading. Online travel booking agency Expedia, in a declaration filed with an official complaint from Washington state's attorney general on Monday, said the travel order 'jeopardizes its corporate mission and could have a detrimental impact on its business and employees, as well as the broader U.S. and global travel and tourism industry. The number of entrants to the United States directly affected by the order is relatively small, Trump administration officials said on Tuesday. Since the order, 721 travelers with visas from the seven countries were denied boarding on U.S.-bound flights, acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said at a briefing. The department has also processed 1,060 waivers for legal permanent residents, such as green card holders, officials said. 'The sense of uncertainty created by (the executive order)… just makes it a difficult time to think about traveling,' industry analyst Bob Mann of R.W. Mann and Co said. Over the weekend, some airlines said they had to rework their flight attendant and pilot rosters, and thousands of demonstrators took to airports across the United States to protest the ban, clogging terminals and delaying travelers.

REUTERS/Damir Sagolj/File Photo An investor looks at an electronic board showing stock information on the first trading day after the New Year holiday at a brokerage house in Shanghai, China, January 3, 2017. REUTERS/Aly Song SYDNEY: The dollar was put on the defensive in Asia on Wednesday after the Trump administration accused Germany and Japan of devaluing their currencies to gain a trade advantage, fuelling a risk-off mood that also kept stocks subdued. The U.S. currency suffered its worst January in three decades after President Donald Trump complained that every 'other country lives on devaluation.' Just hours earlier his top trade adviser said Germany was using a 'grossly undervalued' euro to exploit its trading partners. The accusations drew rebuttals from German and Japanese officials, but looked likely to run for some time. 'Suspicions that Washington may increasingly focus on the value of the dollar were catapulted into the limelight,' ANZ analysts said in a note. 'The early policy implication is that dollar competitiveness could have a prominent role to play in Trump's 'America First' agenda.' The dollar did recoup a little of its losses as the Asian session wore on, edging up to 112.94 yen from a low of 112.08, though that remained well short of Monday's 115.01 peak. The euro was firm at US$1.0793 , having been as high as US$1.0812 and a long way from Monday's trough of US$1.0617. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar  stood at 99.651, having ended January with a loss of 2.6 percent. The jump in the yen kept Tokyo stocks  flat, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  was 0.06 percent lower. Chinese markets were still on holiday but surveys from the Asian giant showed manufacturing and services activity continued to expand in January. Exports from tech bellwether South Korea also grew at the fastest pace in almost five years, another sign the global economy had been on the mend before all the talk of U.S. protectionism darkened the air. FED ON HOLD Investors' hopes for a fiscal boost to the world's largest economy under Trump have been tempered by controversial and protectionist policies that have seen him suspend travel to the United States from seven Muslim-majority countries. The policy uncertainty only added to expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will keep interest rates steady when it concludes a two-day meeting later Wednesday. The setback for Wall Street has been limited so far. While the S and P 500 fell on Tuesday for a fourth consecutive session, it still ended higher for the month. The Dow  dipped 0.54 percent, while the S and P 500  lost 0.09 percent and the Nasdaq  0.02 percent. Apple  shares also jumped 3.3 percent after the bell as sales of iPhones beat expectations, helping lift Nasdaq e-mini futures  up 0.2 percent. Safe-haven bonds benefited from all the unease over Trump's policies and yields on 10-year Treasury debt  eased to 2.46 percent from 2.48 percent early in the week. The retreat in the dollar also boosted a range of commodities, with copper touching a two-month high . Brent crude oil  for April was quoted 10 cents lower at US$55.48, while U.S. crude  eased 8 cents to US$52.73.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson The Apple Inc. store is seen on the day of the new iPhone 7 smartphone launch in Los Angeles, California, U.S., September 16, 2016. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo SAN FRANCISCO: Apple Inc reclaimed the throne as the world's top smartphone seller for the first time in five years on Tuesday, beating out rival Samsung in units shipped for the holiday quarter and boosting revenues with a strong showing for its new, top-of-the-line iPhone 7 Plus. The iPhone sales numbers, and a profit of almost US$18 billion, both handily beat Wall Street expectations, sending its shares up 3 percent in after-hours trading. But the gains were tempered by Apple's cautious outlook for the current quarter, which it mainly attributed to the strong U.S. dollar, which hurts companies like Apple that sell a majority of their products overseas, by forcing them to raise prices, which depresses unit sales, or sacrifice margins. Apple sold 78.29 million iPhones in the fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 31, up from 74.78 million the year before. Analysts on average had expected 77.42 million, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount. That beat Samsung Electronics' 77.5 million smartphone sales in the quarter, according to tech data firm Strategy Analytics, the first time that has happened since the fourth quarter of 2011. The results, which reflected the first full quarter of iPhone 7 sales, come at a time when global demand for smartphones is slowing and cheaper Android alternatives are flooding the market. Apple may also have benefited from Samsung's much-publicized recall of the its fire-prone Galaxy Note 7. Apple is heavily dependent on the success of iPhones, which account for more than two-thirds of its total revenue. Analysts and investors have already set their sights on Apple's 10th-anniversary iPhone, which is expected to feature better touchscreen technology, wireless charging and a shift to a higher-resolution OLED display. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said demand was especially high for the larger iPhone 7 Plus in the fiscal first quarter. Revenue in the services business - which includes the App Store, Apple Pay and iCloud - jumped 18.4 percent to US$7.17 billion, helped by the popularity of games, including Pokemon Go and Super Mario Run, and increased revenue from subscriptions. OVERSEAS CASH Cook, who met with lawmakers in Washington last week, said he was 'optimistic, given what I am hearing' that there would be changes to the corporate tax reform this year that would allow Apple to bring more than US$200 billion in offshore cash back to the United States. 'What we would do with it, let's wait and see,' Cook told analysts in response to a question. 'We are always looking at acquisitions... There's not a size we wouldn't do just based on the size of it. It's more about the strategic value.' Apple is still looking for major new sources of growth as Apple TV struggles to set itself apart from competitors and its plans to enter the autonomous driving market take shape. The company said Apple Watch sales set a record last quarter, but provided no numbers. Analysts expect growth in services to help offset declining hardware sales as the smartphone market matures. The services business also has gross margins that are higher than Apple's overall company average, which could help offset the extra cost of new features like the OLED screens while still meeting an overall gross margin target of between 38 percent and 39 percent. 'That's a very high-margin business that is helping Apple navigate its innovation,' said Anil Doradla, an analyst with William Blair  and  Co. Cook said on Tuesday that he expects services revenue to double in the next four years as the installed base of iPhones and iPads continues to grow. CHINA FALLS While Apple's revenue from the Greater China region fell 11.6 percent to US$16.23 billion for the quarter, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri cast the numbers as positive. 'We were encouraged by our performance in China because it was clearly an improvement over the last couple of quarters. In mainland China in particular, our revenue was flat and actually grew in constant currency terms,' Maestri said. The company forecast revenue of between US$51.5 billion and US$53.5 billion for the current quarter. Analysts, on average, expect revenue of US$53.79 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The rate at which previous Apple customers buy new phones was the same as last year in international markets, executives said, without giving specific numbers. Maestri said the company has had to raise prices as much as 40 percent in some markets. 'Clearly, this issue of the strong dollar doesn't help us,' Maestri said. Analysts on average expect the company to sell 53.43 million iPhones in the current quarter, according to FactSet. For the holiday quarter reported on Tuesday, net income fell to US$17.89 billion from US$18.36 billion the year before. On a per share basis, it earned US$3.36, beating the average analyst estimate of US$3.12, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 3.3 percent to US$78.35 billion, compared with the average analyst estimate of US$77.25 billion. Up to Tuesday's close, Apple's shares have gained about 15 percent since mid-November, compared with the 5.3 percent rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

(AFP/CHRISTOF STACHE) BERLIN: The German industrial conglomerate Siemens said on Tuesday (Jan 31) that full-year earnings would surpass previous estimates, after reporting a 25 per cent jump in quarterly net profit. The company said the stronger earnings in the three months to Dec 31 reflected healthier operating margins in most of its business lines. CEO Joe Kaeser has been pursuing a far-reaching restructuring of the company, whose activities range from gas and wind turbines to trains and medical equipment. 'We are sending a clear signal', Kaeser said in a statement, adding that Siemens would 'continue to rigorously executive our strategy programme', called Vision 2020. It raised its forecast for full-year earnings per share to €7.20 to €7.70 (US$7.77 to US$8.30), compared with its previous goal of €6.80 to €7.20. But the company still expects economic headwinds, including unfavourable foreign exchange rates and limited economic growth and investments because of 'complex geopolitical environment'. It expects only 'modest' revenue growth for the full year, after revenue growth of just one percent in the first quarter, to €19.1 billion. Net profit jumped to €1.94 billion, from €1.56 billion in the same period last year. New orders fell 14 per cent in the quarter, to €19.6 billion. - AFP Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

Posted 01 Feb 2017 06:40 A RAF Lockheed Martin F-35B fighter jet taxis along a runway after landing at the Royal International Air Tattoo at Fairford, Britain July 8, 2016.  REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/File Photo NEW YORK/WASHINGTON: U.S. defense company shares have largely shrugged off President Donald Trump's criticisms over costs and may be poised to fly higher even with prices at lofty levels. Promises by Trump to expand the U.S. military give many investors and analysts confidence the defense industry will grow strongly in coming years. 'There's a multi-year upturn in play here. If you believe we're in the first inning of a multi-year up cycle, the valuations can stay extended for a longer period of time,' said Peter Arment, an aerospace and defense analyst at Robert W. Baird  and  Co. Bank of America-Merrill Lynch analyst Ronald Epstein in his 2017 defense industry outlook said the up cycle started before the election, but the Republican sweep in Congress could mean even more robust growth in defense than previously expected. Defense shares shot up just after the Nov. 8 election but have experienced volatility as Trump in tweets and comments has attacked the defense contractors on costs. He targeted Boeing Co  on Dec. 6 with tweets for 'out of control' costs on new Air Force One planes and said the order should be canceled. On Dec. 12 Trump slammed Lockheed Martin Corp's  F-35 fighter jet program as too expensive. On Monday Trump said he and Lockheed Martin had trimmed US$600 million from the latest contract to buy 90 of the F-35 fighters. But Lockheed's shares ended Monday's session little changed, and analysts downplayed news of the cuts, saying they were likely already being planned by the company, which is the Pentagon's No. 1 weapons supplier. 'We do not think this is anything new, or material,' Jim Corridore, airlines and logistics analyst for CFRA Research, wrote in a note this week, adding that the firm is keeping a 'strong buy' recommendation on Lockheed. 'Overall, we think the F-35 is likely to be a strong driver of EPS for LMT.' Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, who runs the F-35 program for the Pentagon, had said on Dec. 19 that the cost per plane should decrease about '6 to 7 percent' for this the 10th batch of the stealthy jets. Lockheed shares are now up 5.1 percent since the election. Shares of Boeing, which has a much higher percentage of its revenue coming from non-government projects, have risen about 15 percent since the election. The F-35 program is critical to Lockheed's results, with a roughly US$2 billion increase in its fourth-quarter revenue attributed mostly to higher sales of the jet fighter. Investor interest in the space remains high. The iShares aerospace and defense fund  has had inflows in 10 of the 12 weeks since the election, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper data. The ETF is up 9.3 percent since the election, while the S and P 500 aerospace and defense index  is also up about 9 percent in that time, compared with a gain of 6.5 percent in the benchmark S and P 500 But valuations are up as well. The S and P aerospace and defense index is now trading at nearly 18 times forward earnings, its highest level in about 12 years, and above its median of about 15, according to Thomson Reuters data. However, outlooks from some defense companies last week were less bullish than investors were expecting. 'The stocks got ahead of themselves,' and there's still uncertainty ahead for the defense group, said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. Raytheon  forecast 2017 sales below analysts' expectations, while Northrop Grumman , a supplier of parts for the F-35 jets, gave a weaker-than-expected earnings per share outlook for this year. Trump's plan to build a wall on the border with Mexico could benefit defense contractors that make border security systems such as remote video surveillance towers.

Posted 01 Feb 2017 06:19 Updated 01 Feb 2017 07:08 Customers gather at an Apple store during the launch of the new iPhones in 2016. (AFP/KARIM SAHIB) SAN FRANCISCO: Apple on Tuesday (Jan 31) reported a rebound in iPhone sales to lift the tech giant to record revenue in the past quarter in quarterly results that eased concerns of slowing growth. The results showed strong demand for Apple's iPhone 7 models launched last years, even as profits dipped 2.6 per cent to US$17.9 billion. Revenue climbed to an all-time record US$78.4 billion compared with US$75.9 billion in the same period a year earlier, the company said in its earnings update for the fiscal first quarter ending in December. Apple shares were up more than three per cent to US$125.19 in after-market trades that followed release of the earnings results. Apple said that it sold 78.3 million iPhones - the most ever in a quarter - up five per cent from the same prime holiday shopping period the prior year. The growth promised to assuage concerns by investors that iPhone sales, which account for the bulk of Apple's revenue, were softening due to three quarters of sequential decline. 'We're thrilled to report that our holiday quarter results generated Apple's highest quarterly revenue ever, and broke multiple records along the way,' Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in the earnings release. 'We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch.' The amount of money taken in from online services and digital content grew strongly, led by unprecedented customer activity at Apple's online App Store, according to Cook. 'I have not yet done the numbers but I think Apple had the best quarter in the history of humanity,' Asymco analyst Horace Dediu said in a comment fired off on Twitter. Apple, however, did see revenue in its important China market drop 12 per cent to US$16.2 billion, according to the earnings report. iPHONE 7 'A SUCCESS' Neil Saunders, managing director of the research firm GlobalData Retail, said Apple delivered a strong report and eased concerns it had hit a bump in growth. 'The iPhone 7 will be a much steadier contributor and we would argue that the new model has been a success,' Saunders said in a note to clients. 'While it is arguably not a groundbreaking step forward in terms of new features and functionality, it is clear that Apple did enough to stimulate interest and persuade many consumers to upgrade.' But Saunders said Apple 'cannot afford to take its eye off the ball,' noting that 'competitors, including Google and Amazon, are still nipping at its heels with new products and ideas - so it needs to speed up, even if it is just to stand still.' Some analysts say Apple remains too dependent on the iPhone and that it needs to better diversify its revenues amid a sputtering smartphone market and intense competition. Apple said services revenue grew 18 per cent from a year ago to US$7.2 billion, while 'other' products including the Apple Watch, brought in US$4 billion. 'While the iPhone has been arguably the most successful profit driver in recent consumer electronic history, Apple's dependence on sales of hardware to drive revenue is a future pitfall for the company,' said Colin Gillis of BGC Financial. - AFP/de Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

Posted 01 Feb 2017 05:30 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. (REUTERS/Brendan McDermid) Among those that dropped more than one percent were JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Caterpillar, blue-chip companies that had rallied after President Donald Trump's election sparked hopes of tax cuts, infrastructure spending and other growth policies. Analysts said there is greater skepticism that Trump and congressional Republicans will succeed in enacting their agenda following a stream of controversies in the administration's early days, most recently over the executive order on immigration. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 107.04 points (0.54 per cent) to 19,864.09, pulling back further from the historic 20,000 points level and the lowest in a week. The broad-based S and P 500 slipped 2.03 points (0.09 per cent) to 2,278.87, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index finished up 1.07 points (0.02 per cent) to 5,614.79. 'It's a combination of disappointing earnings, Trump worries and macro news,' said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. UPS slumped 6.8 per cent as it reported a loss of US$239 million in the fourth quarter and projected weaker-than-expected 2017 profits due in part to ramped-up capital investments to improve e-commerce business. Sports apparel and shoe company Under Armour plunged 23.4 per cent after reporting earnings that missed expectations, and the departure of chief financial officer Chip Molloy due to personal reasons. Harley-Davidson lost 1.5 per cent after offering a gloomy forecast due to sluggish demand in the United States. Deliveries slumped 12 per cent in the fourth quarter. Pharmaceutical shares were mostly higher after a White House meeting of top executives with Trump, who reiterated a pledge to lower drug prices, but also said he would work to slash regulations to streamline the drug-approval process. Merck rose 0.9 per cent, Amgen 1.5 per cent and Mylan 3.3 per cent. Investors were looking ahead to an earnings release later on Tuesday from Apple, and to Wednesday's finale to a Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting. - AFP/de Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

REUTERS/Mike Blake REUTERS: Packaged foods maker Hormel Foods Corp  said on Tuesday that it had suspended operations at one its pork suppliers in Oklahoma until it investigates claims that pigs were being abused at the farm. Animal rights group Mercy for Animals released a video last week that showed large number of pigs and piglets constrained in small spaces, being treated cruelly and left to suffer from injuries and illnesses without veterinary care. The video, which is 2 minutes and 26 seconds long and is available on YouTube and on Mercy for Animals' website, was part of the group's undercover investigation at the Maschhoffs farm. Hormel said it would send third-party auditors to investigate the claims made in the video. 'We have issued a suspension of all the Maschhoffs, LLC Oklahoma sow operations while a thorough investigation is completed', Hormel said. The Maschhoffs farm said in a statement that they had begun their own investigation into the events depicted in the video, and that they would re-train all employees in Oklahoma on proper production procedures. This is not the first instance that an animal activist group has released a video showing animals being treated cruelly at a Hormel supplier. In 2015, Compassion Over Killing released a video showing workers at a Quality Pork Processors Inc plant beating, dragging and slitting the throats of live animals. Hormel also said on Tuesday that its company-owned farm will be gestation crate free in the next 30 days.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo REUTERS: Video-game publisher Electronic Arts Inc  reported a 7.4 percent rise in third-quarter revenue, helped by strong sales of first-person shooter games 'Battlefield 1' and 'Titanfall 2'. The company launched the highly anticipated games in October and released 'FIFA 17,' the latest version of its top-selling soccer franchise, at the end of September. EA's revenue rose to US$1.15 billion in the third quarter ended Dec. 31 from US$1.07 billion a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, revenue was US$2.07 billion. Analysts on average were expecting US$2.05 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales at EA's digital business rose 20.4 percent to US$685 million in the quarter as players increasingly prefer buying games online rather than physical copies at retail stores. The company's net loss narrowed to US$1 million from US$45 million a year earlier. On a per share basis, EA broke even in the latest quarter, compared with a loss of 14 cents a year ago. EA has stopped reporting non-GAAP measures that adjust for deferred revenue, as it has done since fiscal 2008, to comply with stricter guidelines by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. U.S. financial regulators have issued new guidelines saying that deferred revenue from games with online components should be accounted for over however long people play the games – typically six to nine months.

Posted 01 Feb 2017 05:10 The logo of Exxon Mobil Corporation is shown on a monitor above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, December 30, 2015.  REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo HOUSTON: Exxon Mobil Corp  boosted its 2017 capital budget on Tuesday on a bet that oil prices have stabilized, but posted its lowest quarterly profit since 1999 as it took a US$2 billion charge against the value of natural gas reserves from its buyout of XTO Energy. The world's largest publicly traded oil producer wrote down the book value of part of its North American natural gas and crude reserves, some of which were acquired in 2009's all-stock buyout of XTO Energy, a deal worth roughly US$30 billion at the time. After conducting an annual asset review, Exxon said the value of some reserves in North America's Rocky Mountain region should be lowered due to weak performance and its own tepid outlook on the potential for future commodity price rises. Exxon declined to provide its internal forecast for oil and gas prices. Exxon will report estimates for the value of its proved reserves in February. The US$2 billion impairment charge likely will reduce the value of the proved reserves. Wall Street traders expect oil prices to stay near their current range, between US$54 and US$55 per barrel, for several years and for natural gas prices to remain near their current level, about US$3.13 per million cubic feet. Exxon also said it will increase spending to about US$22 billion this year from US$19.3 billion in 2016. The move came after peers Chevron Corp , Hess Corp  and other oil producers boosted their capital budgets for the year. The 14 percent boost in capital expenditures and the writedown reflect a delicate balancing act by oil and natural gas companies in an era of extreme volatility after a two-year price rout. The higher spending is not due to rising prices for oilfield contract work or other services, Jeff Woodbury, Exxon's vice president of investor relations, said on an earnings conference call with investors. 'It is, by an large, a function of activity level' increasing, Woodbury said. Exxon's announcement came after the company posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by rising oil prices and lower costs. The results reflected the slow and steady improvement in the global oil and gas industry as commodity prices inch higher after a two-year rout. The quarterly report was Exxon's first under Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods. Rex Tillerson, the former CEO, has been nominated by U.S. President Donald Trump to be secretary of state and is awaiting confirmation. Fourth-quarter earnings fell to US$1.68 billion, or 41 cents per share, from US$2.78 billion, or 67 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding the US$2 billion writedown, Exxon earned 90 cents per share. By that measure, analysts expected 70 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Production fell 3 percent to 4.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Earlier this month Exxon said it would pay up to US$6.6 billion to double its holdings in the oil-rich Permian Basin of west Texas, the largest oil field in the United States. Shares of Texas-based Exxon fell 1.7 percent to US$83.40 in afternoon trading.

Net income in the fourth-quarter plunged 39.6 per cent to US$1.7 billion, while full year earnings fell by more than half to US$7.8 billion. The report was the first since Darren Woods was promoted to chief executive after President Donald Trump selected the oil giant's long-time leader, Rex Tillerson, to serve as secretary of state. Tillerson's nomination advanced in the Senate Monday. A final confirmation vote was expected later in the week. The drop in profits is the latest effect of a two-year slump in oil prices. However, oil prices have strengthened since a November agreement of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut output. Exxon plans to boost its capital budget in 2017 to US$22 billion, up from US$19.3 billion last year, vice president Jeff Woodbury said on a conference call with analysts. Woodbury told analysts the higher spending was due to increased oilfield activity, but the company expects 'some market pressures' from higher drilling costs as the industry ramps up. Results were marred by a US$2 billion asset downgrade resulting from low prices, much of it due to impairments in a natural gas region in the Rocky Mountains in the middle of the United States. Exxon said the writing-down of assets was due to 'continued weakness in the upstream industry environment during 2016, continued weak financial results for several assets in North America, and a reduction in the mid-point of the ranges of the corporation's long-term oil and natural gas prices.' The move follows an investigation in New York for not writing down assets due to the oil price crash, a decision that allowed the company to report profits while rivals such as Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell reported losses. ExxonMobil warned in October it also was reviewing its oil and gas reserves, a key industry benchmark, for possible downgrades. The oil giant plans to release its final tally on 2016 reserves in the next two weeks, Woods said. Earnings for the quarter translated into 41 cents per share, below the 70 cents expected by analysts. Shares of ExxonMobil was down 1.4 per cent to US$83.66 in afternoon trading. - AFP/de Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid NEW YORK: BlackRock Inc's exchange-traded fund unit, iShares, topped US$1 trillion in assets in the United States for the first time, a spokeswoman said on Tuesday. The milestone, reached last Thursday, came after a dramatic shift in markets since the November U.S. presidential election, including a rally in U.S. stocks, and is a capstone in a move by investors to lower-cost ETFs. ETFs are a basket of stocks or other assets traded by individual investors and institutions. They often charge lower fees than many mutual funds, incur fewer taxes and offer the convenience of buying entire markets as simply as trading a single stock. Many track indexes instead of trying to beat the market. Demand for ETFs has so far survived debate over the durability of the funds during market stress. ETFs took in US$375 billion globally in 2016. BlackRock pulled in US$140 billion of that, including US$105 billion in the United States, according to BlackRock and FactSet Research Systems Inc. 'We're seeing our clients expand the use of iShares ETFs to replace individual securities, to execute more efficiently than swaps, futures or individual bonds, to take long-term core positions and to construct efficient portfolios,' Martin Small, the U.S. head of iShares, said in an emailed statement. In 2009, BlackRock bought the iShares business from Barclays, which had helped popularize the funds. Today, iShares account for a quarter of BlackRock's assets under management.

REUTERS/Daniel Becerril/File Photo Trucks wait in the queue for border customs control to cross into the U.S. at the World Trade Bridge in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico on November 2, 2016.  REUTERS/Daniel Becerril/File photo CHICAGO: U.S. food producers and shippers are trying to speed up exports to Mexico and line up alternative markets as concerns rise that this lucrative business could be at risk if clashes over trade and immigration between the Trump administration and Mexico City escalate. Diplomatic relations have soured fast this month, as the new U.S. administration floated a 20 percent tax on Mexican imports and a meeting between the presidents of the two countries was canceled. U.S. President Donald Trump has also pledged to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) trade deal with Mexico and Canada. Mexico is one of the top three markets for U.S. farm production. Some U.S. producers of corn, soybean meal and distillers dried grains (DDGs), an ethanol byproduct, are trying to accelerate sales to Mexico because they are uncertain about the risk for new tariffs to disrupt trade, said Rafe Garcia, general manager for U.S. operations at shipper Primos  and  Cousins USA. 'They don't know what will happen in the next month or the next week,' Garcia said about producers. 'They are trying to move everything as fast as they can.' The company, which ships U.S. livestock feed to Mexico and imports Mexican products like molasses, has already talked with U.S. producers about selling into other countries, such as Nicaragua, to reduce their dependence on Mexico, Garcia said. Exports are critical for U.S. farmers as a global slump in prices for agricultural products has pushed incomes to their lowest in years Last week, more than 130 trade associations and food companies, including Cargill Inc  and Tyson Foods Inc , touted the benefits of NAFTA in a letter to Trump on trade. Food producers say the agreement has quadrupled U.S. agricultural exports in the region during the past two decades. Mexico is expected to import about 4 percent of the U.S. corn crop in 2016/17, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). It buys 7.8 percent of U.S. pork production, the U.S. Meat Export Federation said. 'THEY'RE GOING TO RETALIATE' The agriculture community, which strongly supported Trump during the presidential election, has already voiced its concern that he has withdrawn the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact. They are worried Mexico could use tariffs to strike back against Trump's plans to rework NAFTA and build a wall to keep out illegal immigrants. Malcolm DeKryger, president of Indiana pork producer Belstra Milling, said he was worried Mexico would impose tariffs on U.S. ham, which could cause Mexican buyers to turn to Brazil or Europe. 'They're going to retaliate,' he said about Mexico. 'The place they can hit back as fast as they can to try to affect our pocket book is the food.' Mexico could target sanctions on farm products, in particular, in an attempt to punish rural communities that supported Trump in the presidential election, said Katherine Baylis, associate professor of agricultural and consumer economics at the University of Illinois. 'Look at where past trade retaliations have happened: It is amazingly pointed and usually pointed at crucial products from swing states which quite often turn out to be agricultural,' Baylis said. Prominent Mexican politicians, including former President Felipe Calderon, have said the nation should consider ending purchases of U.S. corn if Trump applies new taxes on Mexican exports. U.S. company Ingredion Inc , which produces high fructose corn syrup and other corn products, said its 'geographic diversity balances country-specific headwinds.' In 2009 and 2010, Mexico put tariffs on 99 American exports in retaliation when Washington blocked Mexican trucks from using U.S. highways. The strategy targeted products seen as important to specific U.S. regions, including Christmas trees, apples and frozen sweet corn, to maximize political pressure. The dispute cost U.S. businesses over US$2 billion and cut U.S. exports to Mexico of affected agricultural commodities by 27 percent.

(AFP/TORU YAMANAKA) TOKYO: Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will propose plans to create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the US when he meets President Donald Trump at an upcoming summit in Washington, Kyodo news reported on Tuesday (Jan 31). Tokyo is busy putting together an investment package which 'would translate into hundreds of thousands' of new US jobs, Kyodo said, citing unnamed Japanese government sources. Abe will pitch Japanese companies' cooperation in projects like high-speed rail construction and shale oil development, the report added. The package is to be put forward when the two leaders meet on Feb 10. Japan is one of Washington's closest allies but Trump alarmed Tokyo policymakers during his election campaign late last year by musing about pulling thousands of US troops from the region and suggesting that officially pacifist Japan may need nuclear weapons. Kyodo said that Abe will take up the issue of auto trade at the summit and stress economic contributions of Japanese automakers' investments and jobs in the US. Earlier this month Trump set off concerns about the fate of Japanese firms doing business in the United States after threatening Toyota with punitive tariffs over its new vehicle plant in Mexico. Toyota later said it will invest US$600 million and create 400 jobs at one of its US plants - just weeks after Trump criticised the Japanese auto giant. Trump, speaking to a group of pharmaceutical executives at a White House meeting on Tuesday, accused Japan of currency manipulation. 'You look at what China is doing and what Japan has done over the years, and they played the money market and the devaluation market and we sit there like a bunch of dummies,' he said. However, in a telephone conversation on Sunday, Trump and Abe agreed to work together to counter the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear program and deepen bilateral trade and investment. The call came days after Trump formally withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a vast trade deal encompassing a dozen nations that Abe has backed enthusiastically. US participation is seen as key to the agreement and Abe has said he would keep trying to convince Trump of its merits. The trade deal was negotiated under former president Barack Obama. Trump yanked the deal before the US Congress was able to consider ratification. Abe was the first world leader to meet the US president-elect in New York, visiting Trump just nine days after Americans voted him into office in a surprise victory. - AFP/de Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

Posted 01 Feb 2017 03:25 Updated 01 Feb 2017 03:55 Traders work on the main trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell of the trading session in New York January 15, 2016.  REUTERS/Brendan McDermid BOSTON: A dizzying stream of market-moving tweets and policy talk by  President Donald Trump is finding a hopeful but anxious audience among professional investors looking to make stockpicking great again. After years of losing ground to index funds, portfolio managers and wealth advisers say Trump's assertive moves, like singling out individual companies, may create a chance to set their investment strategies apart - even if they think some of Trump's verbal assaults are just bluster. 'If he’s going to create volatility, we're going to take advantage of it,' said Ross Gerber, president of California wealth management firm Gerber Kawasaki Inc. Professional stockpickers are under pressure to improve returns as investors increasingly turn to cheaper passive investments – redirecting tens of billions of dollars each month. Trump's pledge to shake up regulations affecting sectors such as finance, autos and healthcare, as well as his promise to cut taxes, could create big corporate winners and losers. That could give active fund managers an opportunity, in theory, to showcase their skills. 'This administration was elected with many people hoping for change, and that's going to upset the apple cart with old losers coming back in favor,' said Scott Schermerhorn, chief executive of Granite Investment Advisors in New Hampshire. So far, Schermerhorn has made few changes to his portfolios, like the Granite Value Fund . With Trump in office less than two weeks, he is waiting for clearer signs on what new policies will be introduced. Schermerhorn also said he has talked some clients out of bailing on stocks such as Boeing  or drugmakers after Trump criticized them publicly on Twitter - tweets Schermerhorn said he read as simply negotiating positions. Gerber has already acted on Trump. After the then-president-elect slammed Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jet program as too expensive on Dec. 12, Gerber bought Lockheed shares. Trump said on Monday his administration was able to cut US$600 million from its latest contract for the jet, but Gerber said the case for the stock remains its longer-term outlook. 'Bullying companies ultimately won't change the economics,' he said. DISPERSION The turn to passive management reflects how many active managers have failed to produce the higher returns that would justify their more costly fees. In theory, if Trump produces winners and losers in corporate America, then active managers could be helped by a rise in 'dispersion,' a measure of the gap in returns among stocks. During December, dispersion in the S and P 500 index was 14 percent, the lowest in two years, according to S and P Dow Jones Indices. 'The friend of active management is high dispersion, and transitions. We think we have both of those,' said Collin Bell, a managing director at Goldman Sachs'  asset management division.    But dispersion is a double-edged sword if fund managers wind up on the wrong side of a trade – a distinct possibility given Trump's willingness to talk policy on social media and re-evaluate key foreign policy principles. His recent move to curb immigration has sent major U.S. stock indexes plummeting. 'Trying to react to his tweets, for a long-term investor, I think is a very dangerous game to play,' said  John Linehan, portfolio manager of the US$23 billion T. Rowe Price Equity Income Fund. He said he spends more time following policy discussions, after years in which Washington's actions did not affect particular stocks so much. Linehan cited the on-again, off-again talk of a 'border adjustment tax' as the sort of issue to keep an eye on. A recent jump in volatility has been a boon for day traders, who have a short-term horizon. But Trump's tweets are too sporadic for many of the quantitative strategists from hedge funds and banks, who track patterns and trends. Indeed, higher dispersion could provide a business opportunity for active stockpickers' arch-rivals, the passive funds. To shield investors from stock gyrations, Michael LaBella, portfolio manager at Legg Mason Inc's  QS Investors unit, said it encourages investors to consider diversification products like its Low Volatility High Dividend ETF  in case promised policy changes do not actually emerge. 'Because there is so much policy uncertainty, you can't differentiate what's policy and what's just bluster,' he said.

Germany's biggest bank has finalised a US$7.2 billion settlement with the U.S. authorities over its sale of toxic mortgage securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. It has also agreed to pay US$630 million in fines for organizing US$10 billion in sham Russian trades. Deutsche Bank's management board has decided to waive its own bonuses for 2016.

(AFP/JUSTIN SULLIVAN) DUBLIN: The EU's competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager on Tuesday (Jan 31) defended a landmark decision that US tech giant Apple should pay billions in back-taxes to Ireland. In August, the European Commission, the EU executive arm, ordered the iPhone maker to reimburse a record €13 billion (US$14 billion) in unpaid taxes in Ireland. The EU had accused Ireland of giving Apple a secret tax deal that allowed it to enjoy near zero tax on its huge sales worldwide for more than a decade. Addressing Irish lawmakers in Dublin on Tuesday, Vestager denied that Brussels was conducting a 'witch-hunt' against multinationals such as Apple. Vestager said the investigations in this and other cases in other European countries were purely about illegal state aid. 'We simply want to make sure that they are not used to rubber stamp a way of allocating profits that does not match economic reality,' she said. It did not mean that the EU Commission was assuming the authority over a country's tax rules, the commissioner argued. The investigations 'do not affect the sovereign right of member states to determine their own corporate tax systems, or to set their own tax rates. They are simply about special treatment for certain companies,' she said. Vestager said 'good progress' was being made by the Irish authorities with regards to the collection of the money. - AFP/de Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

(AFP/JUSTIN SULLIVAN) NEW YORK: UPS defended its pricey capital investments on Tuesday (Jan 31) and downplayed worries about free trade in the Trump era after reporting a loss in the fourth quarter and offering a disappointing forecast. The package-shipping giant, which is midway through a series of costly capital upgrades to help compete in the e-commerce era, reported a loss of US$239 million in the quarter ending Dec 31. Revenues jumped 5.5 per cent to US$16.9 billion on an increase in package volumes during the holiday season. But profits were dented by weak industrial activity and a one-time charge of US$1.7 billion due to adjustments in the allotment for its pension plans, the company said. The company's profit forecast for 2017 was below analyst expectations, and it cited the strong US dollar as factor. UPS shares fell sharply following the report. Executives announced plans for US$4 billion in capital spending in 2017, up from the US$3 billion last year, as it builds more high-tech package hubs in response to swelling e-commerce activity. In November, UPS announced plans for a new US$400 million regional package sorting hub in Atlanta, creating 1,250 new jobs. The package delivery giant also plans new projects in Ohio and Florida, and estimates automation technology at these facilities will boost productivity 20 to 25 per cent. Executives defended the investments when questioned by analysts on when they would pay off. 'With this tremendous opportunity, we feel like we need to take the challenge on, because the market is expanding and gives UPS an opportunity to continue to grow,' UPS chief financial officer Richard Peretz said. Chief executive David Abney said he was 'pretty excited' about the prospect of tax reform out of Washington, but was concerned about a border adjustment tax being contemplated that has worried retailers. Abney said he favoured free trade and was confident President Donald Trump would not end it. 'Trump is really not against free trade agreements,' Abney said, although 'he's made it very clear that he wants trade agreements to be fair.' Even so, 'we don't believe the world is falling off a cliff,' Abney said. 'We think there will still be trade agreements.' Shares slumped 5.5 per cent in mid-morning trading to US$110.63. - AFP/de Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

Posted 01 Feb 2017 01:55 A Valero gas station sign is shown in Encinitas, California, U.S., May 2, 2016.  REUTERS/Mike Blake NEW YORK: Valero Energy Corp on Tuesday signaled that record high costs to comply with the U.S. renewable fuels program will continue this year, after the oil refiner was hit with a ballooning tab for the program in 2016. Valero, the largest independent U.S. oil refiner and the first of the sector to report 2016 results, said it expects its costs to meet annual biofuel blending targets required through the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) to be similar in 2017 to the US$749 million last year. 'At this level, this is a significant issue for us so we continue to work aggressively with regulators,' said Chief Executive Officer and President Joe Gorder on an investor call to discuss earnings. These higher reported costs come at a tumultuous time for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which oversees the program. U.S. President Donald Trump, who took office this month, has pledged to slash costly regulations. Valero and others have been pressing EPA to make changes to the program. Valero's 2016 total compliance tab well surpassed the US$517 million the company reported paying three years earlier, when paper credits used by oil companies to meet the requirements soared to record high prices. The RFS requires oil companies either blend increasing volumes of renewable fuels into gasoline and diesel or buy compliance credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs), from those that have. Prices of renewable fuel credits in 2016 were below those record levels, but oil companies needed more to meet higher requirements for ethanol and biodiesel use. Valero's biofuel blending costs totaled US$217 million in the fourth quarter, US$60 million higher than the year-ago period. The year's tally of US$749 million was US$309 million higher than a year earlier, Valero said in a statement on the company's 2016 results, which showed higher-than-expected profits thanks to strong ethanol margins. Valero is also one of the largest U.S. ethanol manufacturers. So-called 'merchant refiners,' which are unable to blend transportation fuels and thus have to buy RINs in an opaque and volatile market, last year requested regulators consider changing the RFS to push the costs of compliance further downstream as the costs swelled. EPA is currently receiving comments on the topic. Renewable fuel RIN prices have plunged nearly 40 percent since Trump's election. The president has sought to install leaders, including an EPA chief, who have been critics of the RFS.

Posted 01 Feb 2017 01:45 Updated 01 Feb 2017 10:45 Warren Buffett smiles before speaking with Bill Gates (not pictured), at Columbia University. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton REUTERS: The failure of Warren Buffett's favored candidate to capture the White House has not dimmed the billionaire's appetite for stocks. Buffett revealed that he has bought US$12 billion of stock for his company Berkshire Hathaway Inc since the Republican Donald Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. In an interview with talk show host Charlie Rose that aired on Friday night, Buffett suggested that Berkshire's post-election stock purchases overall were even higher, reflecting stocks that his deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler bought. 'We've, net, bought US$12 billion of common stocks since the election,' Buffett said. 'The guys that work with me, the two fellows, they probably bought a little bit or sold a little bit too.' The speed with which Berkshire is buying stocks is unusual. It has spent in fewer than three months roughly half what it spent on equities in the three years ending Sept. 30, 2016. Buffett demurred on whether Berkshire has added to its stakes in the four largest U.S. airlines: American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc, Southwest Airlines Co and United Continental Holdings Inc. Berkshire revealed those stakes in mid-November, surprising many given Buffett's long aversion to the sector. Asked why Berkshire dove in, Buffett said: 'It was in large part my decision.' Berkshire will likely by Feb. 14 disclose some of the stocks it has bought, in a regulatory filing listing most of its U.S. holdings as of year end. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate owned US$102.5 billion of equities as of Sept. 30, excluding its stake in Kraft Heinz Co. U.S. stocks rose after Trump was elected, reflecting investor optimism that his policies might boost economic growth, aided by a Congress also under Republican control. Buffett said Trump is unlikely to reach his goal of 4 percent annual growth, but that growth at half that level would over a generation add US$19,000 per person to real gross domestic product. 'Two percent will produce miracles,' Buffett said. The U.S. economy grew by 1.6 percent last year, the lowest since 2011.

(AFP/Leon Neal) But after recovering modestly earlier on Tuesday, European markets ended the session lower, pulled down by weaker prices in New York. Trump economic advisor Peter Navarro bashed Germany for allegedly exploiting an undervalued euro to take advantage of its trading partners. 'The Trump administration appears to be targeting currencies as part of its goal of realigning global trade back in favour of the US worker,' said London Capital Group analyst Jasper Lawler. 'Trump's team criticising the euro in the context of Brexit and populist candidates in upcoming European elections puts 'eurozone breakup risk' at the highest since the bloc's inception,' he said. Investors were also shying away from taking bets ahead of the rate-setting meeting of the US Federal Reserve later this week, analysts said. 'European markets attempted to stage a rebound, but gave in to timidity ahead of the Fed decision,' said strategists at the brokerage Aurel BGC. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will announce the outcome of its first policy-setting of the year on Wednesday. 'ERRATIC AND UNPREDICTABLE' Trump's executive order suspends the arrival of all refugees for a minimum of 120 days, Syrian refugees indefinitely and bars citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. The resulting global outrage spooked investors, who fear the announcement could be a sign the tycoon will press ahead with many of his protectionist promises, overshadowing economy-boosting measures such as infrastructure spending and tax cuts - which had fuelled a rally in November and December. 'Trump is proving to be even more erratic and unpredictable than many feared,' noted XTB analyst David Cheetham. All three main Wall Street indexes ended lower in Monday trade, while London, Paris and Frankfurt each lost around one percent. The sell-off spread to Asia, with Tokyo ending 1.7 per cent lower on Tuesday, while Hong Kong and Shanghai were closed for holidays. Friday's order was the latest controversial move by Trump in his first week, which also included a row with Mexico over trade and his proposed border wall, battles with the media over the crowd size at his inauguration and unsupported assertions that millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 election. - AFP/de Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

Posted 01 Feb 2017 01:11 Updated 01 Feb 2017 02:40 In its latest funding round, Uber was valued at more than US$60 billion. (AFP/Lionel BONAVENTURE) FRANKFURT AM MAIN: German auto giant Daimler on Tuesday (Jan 31) said it had struck a partnership with Uber to supply self-driving cars for the US ride-hailing company. The tie-up comes as both carmakers and ridesharing firms are jockeying to establish themselves as leading players in the burgeoning world of autonomous driving, seen as the future of the auto industry. 'Under the terms of the cooperation, Daimler plans to introduce self-driving vehicles ... on Uber's global ride-sharing network in the coming years,' the companies said in a joint statement. The agreement will see Daimler build and operate self-driving Mercedes-Benz cars for use by Uber, but the statement revealed no financial details. 'As the inventor of the automobile, Daimler aims to be a leader in autonomous driving - one of the most fascinating aspects of reinventing mobility,' Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche said in the statement. San Francisco-based Uber has invested heavily in self-driving car technology in recent years and is currently piloting the use of autonomous vehicles in the US city of Pittsburgh. But it has no car-building experience, prompting it to seek partnerships. 'Self-driving technology holds the promise of creating cities that are safer, cleaner and more accessible,' Uber CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick said. 'But we can't get to that future alone. That's why we're opening up the Uber platform to auto manufacturers like Daimler.' Uber is already working with Sweden-based Volvo Cars to develop self-driving cars for sale by 2021. And in a world first, a self-driving truck built by Uber's Otto unit successfully delivered a beer shipment in October. Cars with some autonomous functions, such as the ability to adjust the speed, are already on our roads. But nearly all the major global automakers - including BMW, Volkswagen and Ford - are racing to get fully self-driving cars on the market in the next few years, often in cooperation with tech firms. US automaker General Motors last year announced a US$500 million (€460 million) investment in Uber's rival Lyft, while Google parent company Alphabet has partnered with Fiat Chrysler to develop self-driving cars. The BMW group, which has partnered with US computer chip giant Intel, said earlier this month it plans to start testing self-driving vehicles on roads in the US and Europe by the end of the year. Auto industry expert Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer of Germany's CAR institute predicted that the tie-up between Uber and Daimler wouldn't be the last in the sector. 'It's almost to be expected. And Uber is sure to work with more car manufacturers in the future,' he told AFP. 'It only makes the world of tomorrow even more exciting.' - AFP/de Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

(AFP/PHILIPPE HUGUEN) WASHINGTON: A top economic advisor to US President Donald Trump bashed Germany for exploiting an undervalued euro to take advantage of its trading partners, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday (Jan 31). The public rebuke of a major trading partner is the latest example of the brash tactic that has become a feature of the new US administration, with Trump himself using public attacks and Twitter to criticise businesses and allies, including Mexico. Peter Navarro, who advised Trump during the campaign and heads the White House's new National Trade Council, said in an interview with the FT that Germany 'continues to exploit other countries in the EU as well as the US with an 'implicit Deutsche mark' that is grossly undervalued.' Trump later said the United States also should take advantage of devaluation as a trade strategy. 'Our country is run so badly we don't know anything about devaluation,' Trump told a group of pharmaceutical executives at a White House meeting. 'You look at what China is doing and what Japan has done over the years, and they played the money market and the devaluation market and we sit there like a bunch of dummies.' During the campaign, Trump repeatedly threatened to take action against China on his first day in office due to its currency policies, by declaring the country a 'currency manipulator.' But economists argue that view is several years out of date. China for years was accused of intervening in currency markets and buying billions of dollars in US Treasury debt to keep its currency undervalued, in order to promote its exports. But in recent years weak economic conditions have kept the yuan depressed and the Chinese central bank instead has been intervening to support the currency and keep it from devaluing further. 'SERIOUS RISK' TO WORLD TRADE The criticism of Germany is not new as the country has large trade and current account surpluses, and the International Monetary Fund, for example, has repeatedly urged the country to increase spending to boost consumption and the sluggish economic growth in the EU. Germany is an exporting powerhouse and gains a trade advantage by being part of the eurozone where the currency value is held down due to the weak economies in the union, like Greece, Spain and Italy, economists say. Were Germany to operate outside the currency union, the Deutsche mark value would be much higher, making the country's exports more expensive and less competitive. However, it is highly unusual to conduct these discussions over policy differences in newspapers rather than behind closed doors. France's Finance Minister Michel Sapin hit back at the Trump White House, saying 'the decisions of the new US administration pose a serious risk to the world trade order.' He warned that 'history reminds us that protectionist retreats are the worst of solutions,' and said neither France nor Europe 'will be able to watch helplessly what might risk being a dislocation of our economic institutions.' German Chancellor Angela Merkel, speaking in Stockholm, deflected the criticism, saying the currency value is the responsibility of the European Central Bank. 'As far as the question of the euro and its assessment is concerned, Germany is a country that has always promoted the European Central Bank to make an independent policy, as did the Bundesbank when there was no euro,' Merkel said. 'Therefore we will have no influence over the choices made by the ECB. So I cannot either, in the situation as it is, and I do not want to change anything.' There has been no comment so far from the ECB. Navarro, a hardliner on trade and especially China's rise, also said the planned trade deal between the United States and European Union - the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - was dead. He repeated Trump's statements that the administration will pursue bilateral agreements that favor the United States. Navarro also reiterated that the Trump administration will focus on bringing manufacturing and production back to the US shores. 'It does the American economy no long-term good to only keep the big box factories where we are now assembling 'American' products that are composed primarily of foreign components,' he said in the FT. 'We need to manufacture those components in a robust domestic supply chain that will spur job and wage growth.' The US had a US$60 billion trade deficit with Germany for the first 11 months of 2016 - nearly identical to the trade deficit with Mexico - while the deficit with the whole European Union was US$134 billion. - AFP/de Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

(AFP/STEPHANIE KEITH) WASHINGTON: US consumer confidence retreated in January after hitting a 15-year high in December, amid a less optimistic outlook for business and jobs, the Conference Board said on Tuesday (Jan 31). The consumer confidence index slipped to 111.8 from 113.3 in December. However, that level is still higher than at any time since July 2008, prior to the outbreak of the global financial crisis. The expectations index, however, fell nearly seven points to 99.8. 'The decline in confidence was driven solely by a less optimistic outlook for business conditions, jobs, and especially consumers' income prospects,' said Lynn Franco, the Conference Board's director of economic indicators. However, Franco noted, 'Despite the retreat in confidence, consumers remain confident that the economy will continue to expand in the coming months.' Confidence in the current situation remained healthy, and improved slightly from December, with 27 per cent of consumers surveyed viewing jobs as plentiful, and 29 per cent labeling business conditions as 'good.' But the outlook for six months out worsened slightly, with 23 per cent viewing business conditions as good, from nearly 25 per cent the prior month, and less than 20 per cent describing jobs as plentiful, from nearly 22 per cent in December. Only 18 per cent expect incomes to increase, compared to 21.5 per cent the prior month. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the decline in confidence is 'more evidence that the post-election spike in confidence is over.' - AFP/de Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

(Photo: AFP/Roslan Rahman)  SINGAPORE: Singapore's manufacturing output in December surged 21.3 per cent from a year ago, on the back of strong growth in electronics and pharmaceuticals output. Excluding the more volatile biomedical manufacturing, output grew 16.1 per cent, according to data released on Thursday (Jan 26) by the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB).  On a month-on-month seasonally-adjusted basis, industrial production rose 6.4 per cent in December 2016 compared to the previous month. Overall, manufacturing output rose 3.6 per cent in 2016 over 2015. STRONG ELECTRONICS, BIOMEDICAL PHARMACEUTICALS OUTPUT Output from the key electronics cluster increased 49.4 per cent in December from a year ago. This was largely supported by the semiconductors segment, which saw output rise by 94 per cent. For the whole of 2016, output of the electronics cluster expanded 15.9 per cent compared to 2015.  The biomedical manufacturing cluster, meanwhile, expanded 44.9 per cent year-on-year in December, said EDB. The growth was mainly due to the pharmaceuticals and medical technology segments, which expanded 53.8 per cent and 19 per cent respectively. The whole cluster grew 13.6 per cent in 2016 compared to the year before. The precision engineering cluster saw an increase of 6.1 per cent in December compared to the same month last year. The machinery and systems segment grew 8.5 per cent with higher export demand for semiconductor related equipment, while the precision modules and components segment recorded higher output of industrial rubber, dies, moulds, tools, jigs and fixtures and metal precision components, added EDB. In the chemicals cluster, output rose 4.1 per cent on a year-on-year basis in December 2016. This was supported by higher output in the petrochemicals (18.4 per cent), petroleum (16.7 per cent) and specialties (4.1 per cent) segments. For the whole of 2016, output in the cluster fell 0.9 per cent compared to 2015. In 2016, the general manufacturing industries' output declined 2.5 per cent from a year ago, although it grew 2 per cent year-on-year in December 2016. EDB said this was mainly attributed to the 22.8 per cent growth in the food, beverages  and  tobacco segment. However, growth in the cluster was moderated by declines in the miscellaneous industries (-10.6 per cent) and printing (-14.6 per cent) segments.  Data showed that transport engineering remained a drag. Production in the marine and offshore engineering segment declined 26.1 per cent year-on-year in December, with lower output in oilfield and gasfield equipment as well as ship building and repair jobs. However, the aerospace and land transport segments grew 15 per cent and 11.5 per cent respectively. - CNA/xk Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

(Photo: Tang See Kit) SINGAPORE: Amid the increasing popularity of single-serve coffee systems, at least one homegrown firm is looking to cash in on the trend. Founded in August 2015, Iris Group produces Nespresso-compatible capsules that can be tailored according to the needs of its customers. According to managing director Giorgio Vergano, Iris Group is the only company in Asia producing customisable capsules that work in Nespresso machines. Since commencing production four months ago, the local firm has attracted various beverage makers from six Asian markets, including Singapore, and Italy. While Mr Vergano declined to reveal the number of businesses he is working with, he noted that most of them are “first-timers” in the coffee-in-a-capsule market. “Our main purpose is to offer the service of capsuling for roasters and smaller businesses that want to enter the capsule market but don’t know how to. All our clients need to do is to give us the ingredients, be it coffee, tea or chocolate, and we will fill up the capsules for them,” Mr Vergano told Channel NewsAsia, adding that the choice of producing Nespresso-compatible capsules is a no-brainer given that the high-end brand from Nestle has long been the dominant market player. The material used for this Nespresso-compatible capsule prevents the ground coffee or tea leaves from coming into contact with oxygen. (Photo: Tang See Kit) Mr Vergano, who has over a decade of experience in the coffee industry after working at Italian brands Luigi Lavazza and Punto Italia Espresso, said he was inspired to start Iris Group with its co-founder, Mr Ken Wong, after noticing the dramatic rise of coffee pod sales.  “The capsule market is growing very quickly, not just in Singapore but the whole world. Asia is a key market where capsules are becoming a trend because of the convenience, quality and variety. If you are using coffee beans or ground coffee, you are stuck to finishing your bag of coffee before you can change. But with capsules, you can have the fun of choosing a different drink every time.” The 41-year-old Italian chose Singapore as the company's headquarters because of the country’s “centralised location” within Asia, as well as the prestige that comes with being made in Singapore. “’Made in Singapore' today has a meaning that stands for quality and we want to be part of that,” he said. At the moment, Iris Group is operating on lean manpower, with only three full-timers, including Mr Vergano and his shareholder, Mr Wong. The company's production facility is located within its headquarters at Ubi Crescent. The key lies in an Italy-made automated machine, whose price tag Mr Vergano would only describe as “a very significant amount of money”. The capsule-filling machine. (Photo: Tang See Kit) “This is a fully-automated, high-speed machine that is tailor-made to our requirements. Needless to say, it was a significant investment but it is one that will ensure the quality and consistency we are looking for.' The machine, which only needs one person to operate, can fill and seal 70 capsules in one minute. While the production speed is swift, the research and development (R and D) process to produce a coffee capsule can be an arduous one. For instance, different types of ground coffee have unique characteristics that might determine how it would react when hot water is injected into the capsule to extract coffee. The quick extraction time of typically around 30 seconds also heightens the difficulties of capsule filling. “It’s not just about receiving the ingredients and then turning on the machine to fill the capsules,” Mr Vergano said. “There’s no standard in terms of how much coffee you put in one capsule; it all boils down to the R and D you do on your part.” “You need to understand the coffee you’re working with. For example, the coffee from our Indonesian customers is light roast coffee and it will react in a unique way in the machine when hot water passes through. If we use the same approach for an Italian coffee that uses typical Italian roasting techniques according to the blends, it would be a disaster,” he added. (From top left) Empty capsules lined up and placed on a conveyor to be filled with ground coffee. After being filled and sealed, the capsules are picked up and placed on another conveyor belt equipped with weight and quality checkers. (Photo: Tang See Kit) The difficulty is also multiplied by the range of beverages that the capsule-filling company does. Apart from ground coffee, Iris Group also produces chocolate and tea capsules. “We use real tea leaves, not instant tea, for our capsules and because each leaf has a different size, softness and texture, it is challenging to control the consistency in weight,” Mr Vergano explained. ENVIRONMENTALLY-FRIENDLY CAPSULES For now, businesses that work with Iris Group are given three types of capsules to choose from, one of which is a compostable capsule made from corn polymer that will dissolve within 90 days. The compostable capsule is made from corn polymer and will dissolve within 90 days. (Photo: Tang See Kit) As more coffee drinkers worldwide opt for their daily jolt of caffeine via capsules, critics have said that the usual plastic or aluminium bucket-shaped pods capped with foil are fast becoming an environmental menace. When asked for his thoughts on this, Mr Vergano said: 'Any form of consumption, not just capsules, creates more waste. The plastic capsules we have can be recycled but the recycling requires assistance and not all consumers are ready and willing to go through the trouble ... The compostable capsule will be a solution to help keep waste at a low level.' Cost is one of the factors why there have been limited takers for the compostable capsule, according to Mr Vergano. “It’s slightly more expensive - at about 2 per cent more each - but we think this is a minor difference in cost that can be easily explained to consumers.” As such, Iris Group hopes that its compostable capsule can appeal to more environmentally-conscious consumers. 'Compostable products are readily available; not just capsules but plastic bags and the items that we use every day as well. I think there needs to be more knowledge and education about this being spread to the public ... and I believe if there was more demand and pressure from consumers, it will come back to those who produce these capsules and products,' he said. Capsules being packed at Iris Group's production facility. (Photo: Tang See Kit) Moving forward, the young local firm is boiling over with expansion plans, including the production of capsules that will be compatible with the Nescafe Dolce Gusto machines, the addition of a roasting facility and widening its presence to Australia by the end of the year. It also has a secret weapon that it hopes will be able to give it a shot in the arm - the “kopi” capsule. The official date for the capsule that will contain the local traditional brew, however, is still under wraps. “No one has been able to produce a ‘kopi’ capsule yet because it is more difficult to be put into a capsule, so we are still preparing ourselves,” said the Italian, who added that the idea came from how he has taken a liking to the local “kopi” since moving to Singapore in 2014. His favourite is iced coffee with condensed milk, locally known as “kopi peng”. “I usually have six cups of espressos a day but now on top of that, I will have iced coffee with condensed milk during lunch at the coffee shop opposite my office,” he said. “To be honest, it’s actually quite good. I like it.” Follow See Kit on Twitter @SeeKitCNA - CNA/sk Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

Apart from Nestle's Nespresso and Dolce Gusto, a bevy of new players are vying for a slice of this burgeoning coffee segment. Posted 25 Jan 2017 08:48 Updated 26 Jan 2017 22:33 Single-serve capsules have been the fastest growing segment in Singapore’s coffee market since 2011, outpacing other segments such as instant coffee with year-on-year growth of 8 per cent in terms of retail value, according to Euromonitor. (Photo: Tang See Kit) SINGAPORE: These days, Ms Crystal Ling’s morning coffee comes in the form of a teal-coloured, bucket-shaped capsule. By popping it into a Nespresso machine in her office’s pantry, black coffee covered by a light caramel-coloured froth fills her espresso cup in about 40 seconds. “I like dark espresso that’s a bit bitter. There’s a café near my office that has what I want but at S$7 a cup, it’s not something that I should be having every day,” said the 27-year-old marketing executive, who is contemplating getting her own coffee machine. “Because these capsules need to be used with the Nespresso machine, I’m thinking of having one at home. My parents say it’s an expensive toy but I think ultimately, it will be cheaper than what I have been spending at cafes previously… The capsules cost less than S$1 each and for that price, it’s not bad.” Banking on novelty, convenience and an array of flavours, coffee capsules and machines, such as those from Nestle’s high-end brand Nespresso, are fast winning over local consumers like Ms Ling. According to research house Euromonitor, single-serve pods – including soft pods made from filter paper and hard pods that are often known as capsules – have been the fastest growing segment in Singapore’s coffee market since 2011, outpacing other segments with average year-on-year growth of nearly 5 per cent in terms of retail value. In comparison, the instant coffee segment grew an average of 2 per cent year-on-year during the same period. Within this burgeoning segment, Nespresso, which first entered the local market in 2008, remains the dominant player. Nestle’s younger and cheaper range of single-serve coffee Dolce Gusto follows behind in terms of market share, helped by its lower pricing and wider variety of retail channels, noted Euromonitor’s research analyst Andrea Lianto. Nescafe Dolce Gusto's latte macchiato series. (Photo: Tang See Kit) And even amid an increasingly sluggish economy, industry observers remain upbeat that the coffee-in-a-capsule segment will continue to outperform the broader coffee market in the upcoming years. “With higher disposable income, increased need for convenience and growing interest in high-quality coffee, coffee capsules still have room for growth in Singapore,” said Ms Lianto. “(Industry players) need to educate and convince consumers about the convenience and quality of capsules so that consumers are compelled to pay a premium for the product. The sustainability of capsules also depends on players’ efforts to maintain consumers’ excitement in the category, for example through new flavour launches.” This optimism is also shared by the market players. Nespresso Singapore, for instance, believes that its price adjustment in November means that its capsules have become an “affordable luxury experience” that consumers can have on a daily basis.  “Even with the slowdown, people will still want to enjoy life and have moments of indulgences… if you look at the new Nespresso capsule prices, you will realise that a cup of Nespresso coffee is now an affordable luxury that you can have every day,” country manager Matthieu Pougin told Channel NewsAsia. “This is what we see in our boutiques as well. Even with the economy slowing down over the past two years, people continued to shop at our boutiques.” Over at Nescafe Dolce Gusto, expectations remain for the brand to see more than 5 per cent growth in the coming years. The Nestle range, which stands for “sweet flavour” in Italian, has logged double-digit growth year-on-year since its foray into Singapore six years ago. “The Singapore economy is facing some of its toughest challenges now (but) for the coffee capsule segment, there should still be good growth,” said Mr Chow Phee Chat, the brand’s head of business in Singapore. “Currently, the capsule segment remains one of the smallest within the market so we do project that it will still be growing very fast.” BREWING COMPETITION But for these brands, a slowing economy that could tighten consumers’ purse strings is not just the only potential challenge looming ahead. While Nestle’s dual-brand strategy has continued to ensure its dominance in the Singapore capsule market, it is a different picture globally. Keen competitors such as US single-serve coffee company Keurig Green Mountain and other upstarts that have begun making less-expensive capsules compatible with Nespresso machines, have been eating into Nestle's global market share. According to Euromonitor, the Swiss food giant controlled 11.1 per cent of the global coffee capsule market in 2015, down from 13 per cent in 2011. Nescafe Dolce Gusto follows behind Nespresso in terms of market share in the Singapore market. (Photo: Tang See Kit) In Singapore, a handful of homegrown instant beverage makers like Owl International and Boncafé have rolled out their respective capsule ranges, and there are other brands of Nespresso-compatible pods that can be easily purchased online. While alternative options have emerged, Ms Lianto said the “minimal presence” of these selections means Nestle will likely be unrivalled for now. But that does not mean that local capsule coffee lovers have not begun exploring other options. Ms Lim Shiyun, who owns a coffee machine from Nespresso, has bought capsules from other brands such as local café chain The Providore. “I’m quite adventurous when it comes to coffee. Since these capsules work with my Nespresso machine, there’s no harm trying out new flavours,” the 29-year-old said. Singapore-based Hook Coffee, for one, produces Nespresso-compatible capsules with sustainably-grown coffee beans sourced from around the world. Founded in early-2016, the online business also sells specialty coffee in other brewing methods such as French press and drip bags, and offers a coffee subscription service. Founders Ernest Ting and Faye Sit told Channel NewsAsia that they introduced capsules to their product line-up last June and since then, sales have been in line with expectations. Given rapid growth in the local capsule market, Mr Ting said the new venture was a no-brainer even if there were significant challenges involved for the young firm. Founders of Hook Coffee, Ernest Ting and Faye Sit. (Photo: Tang See Kit) For one, the production of capsules involved much more extensive research and development (R and D), compared to other brewing methods. “Each pod contains 5.5 grams of coffee and to get the same body and flavour in 30 seconds of extraction time, is very challenging. The roasting technique and the blends have to be precise; even the grinders are different so it’s a very complicated process and a huge amount of R and D investment that goes into making just one pod,” Mr Ting explained. That is why the introduction of new capsule flavours have been slower than other brewing options, which usually sees new additions once a month, he added. Meanwhile, to prevent wastage, an average of 10,000 capsules are filled during each production cycle. With such a large-sized production, it is crucial for the start-up to get things right before the release of every new flavour, Ms Sit told Channel NewsAsia. “Especially for a small market like Singapore, a large production batch is also tricky so we have to be really careful and do a lot of market research.” Despite the difficulties, the two young entrepreneurs still think their five-figure investment into capsules has been worthwhile and remain optimistic on sales, even as competition seems to have been turned up a notch after the market’s biggest player, Nespresso, lowered the prices of its coffee range. “Twenty per cent of our total sales right now are capsules. That’s the same as our drip bags and achieved within six months… As more people want convenient options, we think there will be an increase,” said Mr Ting. The 25-year-old added: “Interestingly, when Nespresso lowered their prices, we maintained ours but we didn’t see a drop in subscribers. In fact, it increased slowly so we think consumers are coming to us because we offer a more artisanal option.” Hook Coffee invested a 'five-figure sum' to add Nespresso-compatible capsules to its product line-up. (Photo: Tang See Kit) PRICE CUTS, NEW PRODUCTS TO GET A SHOT IN THE ARM Still, industry observers said the nearly 30 per cent price reduction follows Nespresso’s recent adjustments in other markets, and will give the high-end brand a shot in the arm when it comes to competing with lower-priced rivals. For instance, Ristretto and Espresso capsules that were S$0.91 each are now S$0.68, cheaper than Dolce Gusto’s Espresso Intenso that retails at S$11.90 for a box of 16. Describing Singapore as a “unique market” where “coffee is part of the people’s DNA”, an increasingly discerning taste for coffee among local consumers has spurred Nespresso’s growth over the past eight years, said Mr Pougin. However, he denied that increasing competition was a catalyst for the recent price adjustment, adding that “Nespresso continues to grow in (Singapore) regardless of competition”. “We didn't make the decision to decrease the price because of competition,” Mr Pougin told Channel NewsAsia. “The reason we did that is because we have been here for more than eight years and we now have the ability and want to offer the Nespresso experience to a bigger group of consumers.” Meanwhile, Nescafe Dolce Gusto said it has “no plans to relook (at) its pricing”, primarily because the brand’s competitive edge remains in its capsule beverages that go beyond coffee and its diverse retail locations such as supermarkets. “We have a place in the market. We offer a variety of beverages not just for coffee enthusiasts… (but) also tea and hot chocolate. We are a coffee system that not only offers good quality coffee, but beverages for the whole family,” said Mr Chow, who added that the brand’s new varieties including healthier options such as its unsweetened Latte Macchiato will continue to “surprise consumers”. In the meantime, Dolce Gusto is also betting on new coffee systems to help it keep up with competition. The brand’s latest “Eclipse” machine comes with an unconventional circular design and a touch screen interface. Nescafe Dolce Gusto follows behind Nespresso in terms of market share in the Singapore market. (Photo: Tang See Kit) DIVERSIFY INTO CAPSULES? MAYBE NOT YET Nonetheless, there is at least one beverage maker who is opting to sit out of the hype for now. Mr Desmond Ng, managing director of local instant coffee brand Gold Kili, told Channel NewsAsia that the rising popularity of coffee capsules has had little impact on sales. The 32-year-old household brand also has no plans to follow in the footsteps of other homegrown beverage makers, given that coffee capsules remain “a non-mainstream option” for now and there are consumers who are not willing to splurge on a coffee machine. “As such, a packet of instant coffee, which is usually four times cheaper than a capsule costing around S$1, remains more attractive to price-sensitive consumers,” Mr Ng added. Gold Kili also prides itself on its traditional brew that is achieved by roasting a mixture of Arabica and high-caffeine Robusta coffee beans with sugar or caramel. Even amid the rise of Western-style coffee that uses just Arabica beans, Mr Ng believes that the traditional brew will continue to have its loyal following. Eurmonitor’s Ms Lianto agrees: 'Instant coffee targets a different segment of consumers through a much lower price point than capsule coffee. On average, one serving of instant coffee costs less than one-third of one serving of capsule coffee. 'As such, many instant coffee consumers, especially those who are price-sensitive, find themselves reluctant to shift completely to capsule coffee for their regular caffeine fix.' However, Gold Kili’s Mr Ng is not ruling out expansion plans to tap on new emerging trends in the local coffee market, such as coming up with specialty coffee bags to attract younger consumers. “Capsule machines remain expensive and with capsules far from being the mainstream option for consumers, we won’t be heading in that direction for now,' he told Channel NewsAsia. 'But we are considering Western-style coffee bags to cater to the tastes of younger consumers. We think there’s still a gap in this market and there’s a business opportunity for us.'

In a media release on Tuesday (Jan 24), M1 said service revenue was S$805.5 million for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2016. Fixed services, however, continued to post strong growth, with revenue increasing 21.4 per cent to S$104.2 million. This accounted for 12.9 per cent of service revenue compared to 10.4 per cent a year ago. M1 said the growth was driven by a larger base of residential, corporate and Government customers. Meanwhile, net profit after tax declined 16.1 per cent year-on-year to S$149.7 million. M1 attributed the fall mainly to “lower international call and roaming revenues, as well as increased depreciation and amortisation expenses from higher fixed asset base in respect of 4G, additional spectrum acquired and new services”. Over the year, M1 added 52,000 postpaid customers and 39,000 prepaid customers, bringing the total mobile customer base to 2.02 million. Mobile churn was stable at 1 per cent from a year ago. Data traffic continued to trend higher, with average postpaid smartphone data usage increasing to 3.6GB per month in the fourth quarter of 2016, from 3.3GB per month a year ago. Mobile data revenue also increased 7.7 percentage points year-on-year to 54 per cent of service revenue. M1’s fibre customer base also increased 32,000 during the year to 160,000. A final dividend of 5.9 cents per share was recommended by the Board of Directors, taking the full-year payout to a total of 12.9 cents per share, added M1. - CNA/ek Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

Posted 23 Jan 2017 13:00 Updated 23 Jan 2017 23:02 A petrol pump in Singapore. (File photo: TODAY) SINGAPORE: After a record two years of negative inflation , consumer prices in Singapore finally rose in December last year, with headline inflation coming in at 0.2 per cent. The rise in the consumer price index (CPI) was due to a larger increase in private road transport cost, which rose by 1.7 per cent in December following a 0.2 per cent rise in November. The rise was the result of higher petrol prices and car park fees, said the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Monday (Jan 23). Services inflation edged up to 1.6 per cent from 1.5 per cent in November, mainly due to a faster pace of increase in holiday expenses, which more than offset the larger contraction in telecommunication services fees. Food inflation was 2 per cent, unchanged from the previous month. Accommodation costs fell by 3.8 per cent in December, similar to the previous month, reflecting continued softness in the housing rental market, MAS and MTI said. Overall retail goods inflation eased to zero per cent in December from 0.2 per cent in November, largely on account of a fall in the prices of personal care products. December's increase comes after the headline consumer price index stayed flat in November from a year earlier, coming off a deflationary trend for the first time in two years. For the whole of 2016, headline inflation came in at -0.5 per cent for the second consecutive year. Core inflation, which excludes the cost of accommodation and private road transport, was slightly lower at 1.2 per cent compared to 1.3 per cent in November. The decline was mainly due to a fall in retail goods inflation more than offsetting an increase in services inflation, MAS and MTI said. For the whole of 2016, core inflation rose to 0.9 per cent, from 0.5 per cent the year before. PRICES EXPECTED TO REMAIN ON THE RISE According to one economist, domestic cost pressures are likely to stay muted due to weak consumption and a subdued labour market. However, prices are still expected to remain on the rise amid stronger growth in developed markets. 'As consumers we're certainly more worried about whether prices will be moving higher this year - particularly at a time when nominal wage growth will be quite stagnant in 2017,' said UOB economist Francis Tan. 'That means real purchasing power of the consumer may be eroded. So I think this is a key concern, key worry for Singapore consumers. 'However, I think that going forward, we shouldn't worry that much because higher prices are linked to better growth globally, and what that means is that some of our manufacturing sectors first, particularly the electronics cluster will be seeing stronger demand and that would spillover positively to precision engineering, and spillover to the services sector,' he added. - CNA/cy Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

(Photo: REUTERS/Edgar Su) The joint declaration will set out principles to spur port and destination development in the region and further encourage industry stakeholders to collaborate and grow cruise tourism in Southeast Asia. At a news briefing on Friday (Jan 20), the ministers reiterated their commitment to develop Southeast Asia into a vibrant cruising destination. About 4.5 million cruise passengers are expected to sail through Southeast Asia annually by 2035 - ten times the current levels of about 450,000. Singapore Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) S Iswaran, who also chaired the meeting, said the cruise industry is a 'network product' that “plays to the strength of ASEAN”. He added that work needs to be done across the board, highlighting the importance of developing infrastructure to accommodate cruise ships of varying sizes and on-shore programmes to complement the arrival of ships. ASEAN TOURISM COOPERATION The ministers issued a joint media statement following the meeting on Friday, in which they said they were “pleased with progress achieved in ASEAN tourism cooperation in 2016”. ASEAN is estimated to have received 116 million international visitors in 2016, up by 6.5 per cent from 2015, with arrivals dominated by intra-ASEAN travel. Earlier during the week, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong officially launched the Visit ASEAN@50 Golden Celebration campaign , as the grouping celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. The regional tourism campaign aims to raise international arrivals to 121 million in 2017, and tourist spending to US$83 billion. In the joint media statement, the ministers added that they are confident that tourism will continue to contribute towards broader regional integration targets under the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) initiative. Conceived as a single market and production base, the AEC is part of broader efforts to integrate ASEAN economies, and officially kicked off at end-2015. Another focus of regional integration efforts has been to facilitate travel around the region, “both within ASEAN and from outside ASEAN to within”, Mr Iswaran said. “This is assisted by developments in technology and data, and in the biometrics that are happening,” he said. “So I think we need to allow for that to evolve, so that we can find the right balance between on the one hand, facilitating freer travel and on the other hand addressing some of the legitimate security concerns.” Next year's ASEAN Tourism Forum will be held in Thailand with the theme ASEAN - Sustainable Connectivity, Boundless Prosperity. - CNA/ek Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

(Photo: Calvin Hui) SINGAPORE: Multipurpose port operator Jurong Port launched a new training institute called the Jurong Port Academy on Friday (Jan 20). Located at the Devan Nair Institute for Employment and Employability (e2i), the Jurong Port Academy is part of the port’s efforts to transform the multi-purpose port industry by leveraging new technology and innovation to enhance capabilities, increase productivity and upgrade the skills of port workers. The academy will cater to about 1,900 workers from Jurong Port and its partner companies, training them with a curriculum that includes classroom based training, simulator classes alongside on-site training and online learning.  Jurong Port - which handles general cargo such as like cement, sugar and MRT trains - has invested around S$2.8 million into the academy, with funding support from the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore. Jurong Port chief executive officer Ooi Boon Hoe said on Friday that the port is facing challenges such as an ageing workforce and slow growth in productivity. The port operator is hoping to change this by introducing new machinery to automate processes and reduce the manual nature of work. The new 2400sq ft academy will teach workers to operate new equipment. For instance, they will learn to use sideloaders - forklifts that load and unload from the side, allowing them to navigate narrower walkways and spaces than standard forklifts - to make the handling of steel cargo easier. The sideloader can be driven by one driver, replacing three stevedore workers in loading and unloading cargo from the ship to the shore, Mr Ooi said.  Workers being trained to use the sideloaders at the Jurong Port training yard. (Photo: Calvin Hui) Training simulators will also give workers the chance to learn how to operate cranes in a safe and controlled environment before progressing to the actual operations. SHIPPING INDUSTRY FACING 'DISRUPTIVE CHANGES': JOSEPHINE TEO Speaking at the official launch of the Academy, Senior Minister of State for Transport Josephine Teo said the challenges faced by Jurong Port in training port workers to prepare them for new jobs came amid “disruptive changes” faced by the shipping industry. “It is inevitable that some jobs will change. Some port workers will have to learn how to operate new equipment, others may have to perform new functions - for example after manual processes become automated,” she said. “Port workers will need support and help to upgrade their skills and capabilities.” According to Jurong Port, there are about 18 stevedore companies that employ about 700 workers in Singapore.  The director of operations for one such company, Dockers Marine, said the launch of the academy was timely.  Mr Selva Raj said that he has had difficulties recruiting new stevedores because certification courses vital to stevedore operations, such as for the operation of ship cranes, have not been available in recent years. The launch of the academy will see the reintroduction of such courses, allowing stevedore companies to recruit new workers.  To ensure that the academy will be relevant, Jurong Port will also form a learning council comprising representatives from the stevedore community and the National Transport Workers’ Union to advise the Jurong Port Academy on its training activities.  - CNA/mz Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

(File photo: Reuters) 'While market sentiment has improved, uncertainty around future US policies and slowing Asian economies will influence trading activity going forward,' chief executive officer Loh Boon Chye said in a statement on Thursday (Jan 19). The bourse has taken measures to shore up market liquidity, improve the quality of listings and strengthen its regulatory framework after a penny stocks crash in 2013 battered investor confidence, but faces a tough task to improve trading activity. Though SGX has developed into an Asian hub for listings of Real Estate Investment Trusts, which typically pay out strong dividends, it has struggled to attract large initial public offerings and has seen a spate of privatisations from companies, hit by poor valuations. But Mr Loh told reporters at a press briefing on Thursday that for its second fiscal quarter earnings, SGX is expecting a “pipeline” of new listings, including those in the infrastructure, real estate, tech and consumer sectors. “We are encouraged by the healthy pipeline of companies from our key sectors seeking listing on both the mainboard and Catalist,' he said. 'The efforts over the last few months to take a sectoral approach in marketing SGX as a listing venue is beginning to bear fruit. Subject to market conditions, we expect the number of listings in the second half of FY17 to be higher than first half of FY17.” The exchange posted net profit of S$88.3 million (US$61.9 million) in the October-December period, compared to the S$85.9 million average estimated by four analysts and S$83.7 million reported in the same period a year ago. Total revenue edged up 3 per cent to S$199.6 million. 'Our results this past quarter reflect higher levels of market activities compared to a year ago as the conclusion of the US presidential election and clarity on interest rates environment brought participants back to the market,' said Mr Loh. To diversify its business, SGX bought London's Baltic Exchange last year as it sees long-term potential for freight derivatives and clearing along with its growing derivatives segment. SGX’s chief regulatory officer, Tan Boon Gin, also said the exchange is looking to put out a public consultative paper for dual-class shares by the end of this quarter. CEO Loh added: “We have broadcast our intention to offer various capital class structures, dual-class included. We have done market discussion, we held the round table, and as Boon Gin mentioned, earlier, we will launch a public consultation by the first quarter of this year. And I think we have given quite a bit of time for the topic to be discussed in the market place, but we will now follow up with the public consultation.' This comes as Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) said it is planning to consult the market on the launch of a third board, which includes the dual-class framework.

REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch BERLIN: Germany's centre-left chancellor candidate Martin Schulz has criticised U.S. President Donald Trump's policies as 'un-American' and warned against lifting sanctions imposed against Russia over its role in the Ukraine crisis. In one of the sharpest remarks yet by a senior German politician since the new American leader took office, Schulz told the Funke media group in an interview published on Wednesday that Europe had to stand up to defend liberal values. 'What Trump is doing is un-American,' Schulz said, adding that the United States like no other country in the world stood for enlightenment, democracy and freedom. 'If Trump is now driving a wrecking ball through this set of values, then I will tell him as chancellor: That's not the policy of Germany and Europe,' Schulz added. Germany's Social Democrats last week nominated former European Parliament president Schulz to run against Chancellor Angela Merkel in a federal election in September, and the surprise move has boosted popular support for the centre-left party. Merkel said on Monday the global fight against terrorism does not warrant putting groups of people under suspicion, adding Trump's order to restrict people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States violates the spirit of international cooperation. Turning to Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Ukraine conflict, Schulz said that sanctions imposed against Russia could only be lifted after both sides had implemented the so-called Minsk peace plan. 'As long as the Minsk peace agreement is not fully implemented, the sanctions cannot be lifted. We must tell Putin very clearly that Russia is obliged to respect and defend international law,' Schulz said. Schulz' comments bring more clarity about his stance on Russia after some leading Social Democrats have voiced support for a partial lifting of sanctions as long as Russia is implementing some aspects of the plan. Merkel, one of the architects of the peace deal, has repeatedly said that sanctions against Russia can only be lifted once the Minsk agreement has been fully implemented.

REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch WELLINGTON: New Zealand Prime Minister Bill English called an election on Wednesday for Sept. 23 after taking over as premier in December following the unexpected resignation of his predecessor, John Key. English's centre-right National Party has governed for the past eight years and is seeking a fourth straight term, this time without the popular Key. The next election was due around September this year. A poll by Roy Morgan in January showed the National Party more than 6 percent ahead of the rival coalition of the Labour Party and The Greens, enough to comfortably win re-election. English, a political veteran who previously served as finance minister, said the government would seek to win re-election on the back of its economic record. 'The National Party will be campaigning on its strong record as a government and New Zealand's strong economic performance,' English told reporters in Wellington. New Zealand in December forecast the 2016/17 budget surplus at NZUS$473 million (273.54 million pounds), which is expected to grow to NZUS$8.5 billion by 2020/21, despite a commitment of NZUS$2 billion to repair infrastructure damaged by a major earthquake in November. New Zealand is a small, export-dependent nation which would be vulnerable to U.S. protectionism under newly-elected President Donald Trump, while domestically its central bank has warned about an overheated housing market, which is stirring voter complaints about affordability.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump on Tuesday (Jan 31) nominated Neil Gorsuch for a lifetime job on the US Supreme Court, picking the 49-year-old federal appeals court judge to restore the court's conservative majority and help shape rulings on divisive issues such as abortion, gun control, the death penalty and religious rights. The Colorado native faces a potentially contentious confirmation battle in the U.S. Senate after Republicans last year refused to consider Democratic President Barack Obama's nominee to fill the vacancy caused by the February 2016 death of conservative justice Antonin Scalia. Gorsuch is the youngest nominee to the nation's highest court in more than a quarter century, and he could influence the direction of the court for decades. Announcing the selection at the White House flanked by the judge and his wife, Trump said Gorsuch's resume is 'as good as it gets.' Trump said he hopes Republicans and Democrats can come together on this nomination for the good of the country. 'Judge Gorsuch has outstanding legal skills, a brilliant mind, tremendous disciple, and has earned bipartisan support,' Trump said. 'Depending on their age, a justice can be active for 50 years. And his or her decisions can last a century or more, and can often be permanent,' Trump added. Gorsuch is a judge on the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and was appointed to that post by Republican President George W. Bush in 2006. Some Democrats in the U.S. Senate, which votes on whether to confirm judicial nominees, have already said they would seek to block whoever Trump nominates. Gorsuch is considered a conservative intellectual, known for backing religious rights, and is seen as very much in the mold of Scalia, a leading conservative voice on the court for decades. A senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the choice of Gorsuch was seen by the White House as a significant departure from Supreme Court nominations from the recent past, given that many justices have come from the eastern United States. Gorsuch lives in Boulder, Colorado, where he raises horses and is a life-long outdoorsman. The official described Gorsuch as a mainstream judge who should easily be confirmed by the Senate. The official noted that the Senate confirmed him for his current judgeship in 2006 by voice vote with no one voting against him. The official said the White House feels Gorsuch has the qualities that Democratic senators said they wanted to see in a justice during visits with senior Trump officials about filling the vacancy. 'He plays it straight. He sticks to principles, and his opinions reflect a consistency regardless of who is in his courtroom,' the official said of Gorsuch. Trump made his choice between two U.S. appeals court judges, Gorsuch and Thomas Hardiman of the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, according to a source involved in the selection process. Gorsuch became the youngest U.S. Supreme Court nominee since Republican President George H.W. Bush in 1991 selected conservative Clarence Thomas, who was 43 at the time. He is the son of Anne Burford, the first woman to head the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. She served in Republican President Ronald Reagan's administration but resigned in 1983 amid a fight with Congress over documents on the EPA's use of a fund created to clean up toxic waste dumps nationwide. Trump's selection was one of the most consequential appointments of his young presidency as he moved to restore a conservative majority on the Supreme Court that had been in place for decades until Scalia died at age 79 on Feb. 13, 2016. Trump, who took office on Jan. 20, got the opportunity to name Scalia's replacement only because the Republican-led U.S. Senate, in an action with little precedent in U.S. history, refused to consider Obama's nominee for the post, appeals court judge Merrick Garland. Obama nominated Garland on March 16 but Republican senators led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell denied Garland the customary confirmation hearings and vote. Trump has said his promise to appoint a conservative justice was one of the reasons he won the Nov. 8 presidential election, with Christian conservatives and others emphasizing the importance of the pick during the campaign. Trump last week said evangelical Christians would love his nominee. Trump's fellow Republicans hold a 52-48 majority in the Senate. The minority Democrats, irate over Garland's rebuff, potentially could try to block the nomination with procedural hurdles. The new appointee would expand the court's conservative wing, made up of John Roberts, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. Kennedy long has been considered the court's pivotal vote, sometimes siding with the liberals in key cases such as the June 2016 ruling striking down abortion restrictions in Texas. The court's restored conservative majority likely would be supportive toward the death penalty and gun rights and hostile toward campaign finance limits. Scalia's replacement also could be pivotal in cases involving abortion, religious rights, presidential powers, transgender rights, voting rights, federal regulations others. Gorsuch has strong academic qualifications, with an Ivy League education: attending Columbia University and, like several of the other justices on the court, Harvard Law School. He also completed a doctorate in legal philosophy at Oxford University, spent several years in private practice and worked in George W. Bush's Justice Department. Gorsuch joined an opinion in 2013 saying that owners of private companies could object on religious grounds to a provision of the Obamacare health insurance law requiring employers to provide coverage for birth control for women. As long as Kennedy and four liberals remain on the bench, the court is not expected to pare back abortion rights as many U.S. conservatives fervently hope. The Supreme Court legalized abortion in the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling. In June, the justices ruled 5-3 to strike down a Texas law that restricted abortion access, with Kennedy and the liberals in the majority. The current vacancy is the court's longest since a 391-day void from 1969 to 1970 during Republican Richard Nixon's presidency. After Abe Fortas resigned from the court in May 1969, the Senate voted down two nominees put forward by Nixon before confirming Harry Blackmun, who became a justice in June 1970. Aside from that one, no other Supreme Court vacancy since the U.S. Civil War years of the 1860s has been as long as the current one. Advocacy groups geared up for a fight. Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative legal advocacy group, said it would launch the first part of a US$10 million media advertisement campaign on Tuesday night in favor of Trump's pick. The effort will hold Senate Democrats who face election in 2018 'accountable for their choice' on the Supreme Court, the group said. Liberal groups including People For the American Way and abortion rights advocate NARAL Pro-Choice America planned a nighttime rally in opposition to Trump's nominee outside the Supreme Court after the announcement. Some Democrats have threatened to pursue a procedural hurdle called a filibuster, meaning 60 votes would be needed in the 100-seat Senate unless its long-standing rules are changed. Trump's fellow Republicans hold a 52-48 majority, meaning some Democratic votes would be needed to confirm his pick. Trump said last week he would favor Senate Republicans eliminating the filibuster, a change dubbed the 'nuclear option,' for Supreme Court nominees if Democrats block his pick. Trump during his presidency may get to make additional appointments to the Supreme Court. Liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who Trump called upon to resign last July after she called him 'a faker,' is 83 while Kennedy is 80. Stephen Breyer, another liberal, is 78. If any of those three is replaced by a Trump appointee, conservatives would be eager to bring cases challenging the Roe v. Wade ruling in the hope it would be overturned, long a goal for many Christian conservatives. - Reuters Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

(Photo: Carnegie Mellon University) PITTSBURGH: Artificial Intelligence (AI) triumphed over humans in a game that has been one of its biggest challenges - poker.  At a 20-day poker tournament at the Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh which ended on Monday (Jan 30), four top human poker players pitted their skills against an AI program called Libratus which was invented by researchers from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). The AI program collected more than US$1.5 million in chips to emerge victorious over the four human players – Dong Kim, Jason Les, Jimmy Chou and Daniel McAulay. The Brains vs Artificial Intelligence competition saw them spend 11 hours each day on computer screens battling an unfamiliar opponent. “The best AI’s ability to do strategic reasoning with imperfect information has now surpassed that of the best humans,” said Libratus co-creator Tuomas Sandholm in a press release. “The computer can’t win at poker if it can’t bluff,” said Frank Pfenning, head of the Computer Science Department at CMU. “Developing an AI that can do that successfully is a tremendous step forward scientifically and has numerous applications. Imagine that your smartphone will someday be able to negotiate the best price on a new car for you. That’s just the beginning.” Libratus relied on the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center’s Bridges computer, which, according to CMU, has a “total speed is 1.35 petaflops, about 7,250 times as fast as a high-end laptop and its memory is 274 Terabytes, about 17,500 as much as you’d get in that laptop.” The program is an improved version of an earlier model known as Claudico which lost in the same tournament in 2015. - CNA/mn Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

REUTERS/Adriano Machado The countries promised to share intelligence and transportation along a porous 1,000-mile (1,600 km) border cutting through the Amazon rainforest, where they have struggled to slow the flow of drugs in recent years. Demobilization of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) as part of a deal ending more than 50 years of war has raised concerns that heavily armed former combatants could join with increasingly powerful drug gangs in Brazil. 'We cannot let peace in Colombia be cause for concern in the region,' said Colombian Defence Minister Luis Carlos Villegas. 'We must stop the so-called dissident FARC forces from advancing toward our borders ... All of our military and policing muscle will be brought against the dissidents.' The splintering of FARC forces coincides with a bloody realignment among the drug gangs running the roughly US$4.5 billion (£3.6 billion) cocaine trade in Brazil, the world's biggest consumer after the United States, and funnelling drugs to Europe. For years, Brazil's two most powerful gangs, the Sao Paulo-based First Capital Command (PCC) and the Red Command, based in Rio de Janeiro, divided the national drug market and shared the most lucrative trafficking routes. However, a wave of prison massacres starting in Manaus this month signalled a violent break between the PCC and gangs allied with the rival Red Command, leaving about 140 dead and underscoring the chaos in Brazil's penitentiary system. Brazilian Defence Minister Raul Jungmann stepped up visits to the country's remote border regions, pledging to double the budget for a high-tech surveillance programme supporting some 1,500 soldiers in the 24 garrisons along the Amazon border.

Posted 01 Feb 2017 07:25 Updated 01 Feb 2017 07:30 File photo of US President Donald Trump. (Photo: AFP/NICHOLAS KAMM) WASHINGTON: US Senate Democrats on Tuesday (Feb 1) postponed votes on several of President Donald Trump's Cabinet nominees, citing their responsibility to do a 'thorough vetting,' while Republicans accused them of unreasonable delays in considering the picks. Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee exploited Senate rules to delay until Wednesday a vote on Senator Jeff Sessions' nomination to be attorney general. That job was in the spotlight after Trump fired the acting attorney general on Monday over her refusal to defend his executive order blocking nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. Democrats also boycotted a meeting of the Senate Finance Committee where votes had been scheduled on Steve Mnuchin to be Treasury secretary and Tom Price to head the Health and Human Services Department. Since at least one Democrat is required to be present for the committee votes to take place, no votes were held. Despite the delays, all three nominees are considered likely to be confirmed once their names are sent to the full Republican-led Senate. The White House, as well as Republicans on Capitol Hill, accused Democrats of slow-walking the work of the government. 'The people want change. President Trump is delivering that change. And the only response from Senate Democrats so far is to try to stall the core functions of our government,' said White House press secretary Sean Spicer. 'When will the Democrats give us our Attorney General and rest of Cabinet!' Trump said in a tweet. 'No wonder D.C. doesn't work!' Senate Democrats were unapologetic, with their leader, Chuck Schumer, saying it was their obligation to 'thoroughly vet' Trump's Cabinet nominees. 'And if it takes a little longer, they could be in office up to four years, and it makes eminent sense to get their views out,' Schumer told reporters. The Senate has already confirmed several of Trump's picks for national security posts, and the chamber voted 93-6 on Tuesday to confirm Elaine Chao, wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, as head of the U.S. Transportation Department . EXECUTIVE ORDER CONTROVERSY Sessions' closeness to Trump - he was the first senator to endorse him during Trump's presidential campaign - was clearly working against him as far as Democrats were concerned following several days of controversy over Trump's executive order on immigration. 'We saw last night that it is also the duty of our nation's chief law enforcement officer to support and defend the Constitution when the president's actions do not. The attorney general swears an oath to the Constitution, not to a president,' said Senator Dick Durbin, a member of the Judiciary Committee, elaborating on his opposition to Sessions. The Judiciary Committee rescheduled its vote on Sessions for 10:30 a.m (1530 GMT) on Wednesday. Democrats on the Finance Committee said they were delaying votes on Price and Mnuchin because they wanted more information on Price's stock trades in an Australian medical company and reports that Mnuchin's former bank, OneWest, used automated 'robo-signings' of foreclosure documents, which apparently contradicted statements the nominees had made to senators. 'We've made clear that we need additional information to make these judgments,' said Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the committee. It was unclear when the committee votes would be held. Republican Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Finance Committee, called the Democratic boycott 'shocking' and 'offensive.' 'What's the matter with the other party?' he asked. 'Are they that bitter about Donald Trump?' - CNA Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

Posted 01 Feb 2017 07:19 UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura attends the Syria peace talks in Astana. (AFP/Kirill KUDRYAVTSEV) UNITED NATIONS: UN-led peace talks on Syria have been postponed until Feb 20 to allow a ceasefire to take hold and to give the opposition time to present a united front, the UN envoy said on Tuesday (Jan 31). The talks in Geneva had been scheduled to begin on Feb 8 but Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov last week announced they would be delayed, without providing reasons. UN envoy Staffan de Mistura told a closed meeting of the Security Council that the postponement would help bolster preparations for the talks aimed at ending the nearly six-year war. 'We want to give a chance both to the government to become seriously engaged in discussions and the opposition (...) to actually be able to be given a chance to come with one unified opposition,' De Mistura told reporters after the meeting. Russia, Iran and Turkey last week led talks in the Kazakh capital of Astana on shoring up a ceasefire in Syria, where more than 310,000 people have died. Map of the Syrian conflict. (AFP/Thomas SAINT-CRICQ, Paz PIZARRO) 'If the ceasefire becomes as solid as we hope that will only help the Syria talks,' said the envoy. The Syrian opposition has been divided over representation to the talks. De Mistura warned that if the opposition failed to agree on the composition of the delegation by Feb 8, he will select the representatives from the various groups who will come to the peace table. 'If by the 8th of February, the opposition will not be ready to come up with a unified group, I will have to ... actually select the delegation in order to make sure that it can be as inclusive as possible,' he said. FEARS OF SIDELINING UN The council heard a report from De Mistura amid concerns that the Astana discussions could open up a new track of negotiations. During the Astana talks, Russia, Syria's main ally, presented opposition rebels with a draft constitution that was immediately rejected by the groups. The unilateral move by Russia raised concern in Western capitals. 'We have been concerned that the Geneva talks have been delayed and we would be concerned if there were any watering down of the basis of those talks,' British Ambassador Matthew Rycroft told reporters. 'It's very important that there is confirmation that the UN will lead the next round of talks,' said Swedish Ambassador Olof Skoog, this month's council president. 'The UN has to be front and center in the political process,' said French Ambassador Francois Delattre. He cited the need to respect the Geneva communique agreed with Russia that calls for a transition in Syria. 'We start with a transition, then the constitution, and then the elections,' said Delattre. 'I think if we can all stay on this line, then we can move.' Previous UN-led talks have broken down over disagreements on ensuring a transition in Damascus that would lead to President Bashar al-Assad's exit from power. Western powers have for weeks questioned the purpose of the Astana talks and raised concern that they could sideline the Geneva talks. Turkey, which backs rebel forces, has for the first time conceded that a peace deal that excludes Assad from power might not be possible. The new date was announced after US Ambassador Nikki Haley meet with De Mistura on Monday to discuss the way forward in Syria. - AFP/de Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

Inquam Photos/Octav Ganea/via REUTERS More than 10,000 people gathered outside government headquarters in the capital, Bucharest, in freezing temperatures and thousands more in cities across Romania shortly after the emergency decree was announced. Protesters in Bucharest shouted: 'Thieves!' and 'Traitors!' and called for the government to resign. Romania's leftists swept into power in December, promising higher wages and pensions in a parliamentary election that underscored a deepening divide between older rural voters, tired of austerity, and younger city-dwellers. Their plans to ease anti-corruption rules were unveiled earlier this month, triggering the largest street protests since the 1989 fall of communism. The leftists said the changes were needed to get the criminal code in line with recent constitutional court rulings. The Cabinet of Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu has drawn criticism from President Klaus Iohannis, chief judges and prosecutors, civil rights groups, diplomats and the European Commission, which has Romania's justice system under special monitoring. 'Today is a day of mourning for the rule of law,' Iohannis said in a statement. 'The government has ignored the dreams of millions of Romanians who want to live in a country free of corruption.' WIDESPREAD ABUSE Romania is one of Europe's most corrupt states, with graft rife in state administration and many areas of public life. Efforts to stamp out abuse have accelerated over the past four years. Prosecutors have indicted nearly 2,000 people in cases involving abuse of power that have caused damages totalling up to 1 billion euros in the past three years. Several leading politicians are under investigation or on trial in abuse-of-power cases, including the leader of the ruling Social Democrats and lower house Speaker Liviu Dragnea. The emergency decree - which takes effect immediately -  would decriminalise some offences, including abuse of power causing financial damage of less than 200,000 lei (£38,154). It also approved a draft bill granting prison pardons for several offences that now needs parliament's approval. 'This is a strong hit against criminal justice in Romania, and the impact will be major ... on all citizens,' anti-corruption legal expert Laura Stefan said about Tuesday's announcement.

Posted 01 Feb 2017 06:35 A general view shows the Jewish settlers' outpost of Amona (front) and the Palestinian village of Silwad in the background, in the West Bank November 16, 2016. REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun JERUSALEM: Israel announced plans on Tuesday for 3,000 more settlement homes in the occupied West Bank, the third such declaration in eleven days since U.S. President Donald Trump took office. Trump has signalled he could be more accommodating towards such projects than his predecessor Barack Obama. A statement from the Israeli Defence Ministry, which administers lands Israel captured in a 1967 war, said the decision was meant to fulfil demand for housing and 'return to life as usual'. The announcement came close to midnight as preparations began for the eviction of 330 settlers from an outpost in the West Bank. The Supreme Court had ruled that the Amona outpost must be evacuated by Feb 8. because it was built illegally on privately-owned Palestinian land. Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are due to meet in Washington on Feb. 15. The president's chief spokesman said last week the two leaders would discuss settlement building. The muted response from the Trump White House so far on Israel's settlement announcements has been a clear departure from Obama, whose aides routinely criticized settlement construction plans. An announcement a week ago by Israel that it would build some 2,500 more homes in the West Bank drew rebuke from the Palestinians and from the EU. It followed approval of more than 560 new homes in East Jerusalem days before. Palestinians want the West Bank and Gaza Strip for an independent state, with its capital in East Jerusalem. Israeli troops and settlers withdrew from Gaza in 2005. Most countries consider settlements illegal and an obstacle to Israeli-Palestinian peace as they reduce and fragment the territory Palestinians need for a viable state. Israel disagrees, citing biblical, historical and political connections to the land - which the Palestinians also assert - as well as security interests.

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) in Los Angeles, California. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images/AFP) WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump has crushed the most defiant display yet of official opposition to his immigration and refugee restrictions - but resistance continued to spread on Tuesday (Jan 31), inside and outside the government. Trump's swift dismissal of acting attorney general Sally Yates for refusing to defend his executive order capped a night of high drama, Washington-style, that drew comparisons with a flurry of urgent housekeeping by Richard Nixon at the height of the Watergate scandal. Trump came out fighting on Tuesday, hitting out at Democrats for stalling on the approval of his nominee for attorney general and the rest of his cabinet. 'They should be ashamed of themselves! No wonder D.C. doesn't work!' Trump wrote on Twitter. But as the president defended his move to bar entry for people from seven mainly Muslim countries and halt the US refugee resettlement program, challenges were mounting on all sides - from the United Nations to lawmakers in his Republican Party. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres sharpened his criticism of the ban, calling it a 'blind' measure that was more likely to fan extremist propaganda than combat the threat of terrorism. And as former national security officials warned that the order sends exactly the wrong message to Muslims - that America is at war with them over their faith - even US diplomats jumped into the fray in a rare display of dissent in an administration just a week old. KEEPING 'BAD PEOPLE' OUT Trump's order bars US entry for travellers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. It also suspends the arrival of all refugees for at least 120 days, and Syrian refugees indefinitely. It has led to the detention of more than 100 people at US airports and mass protests in many cities, and raised howls of protests abroad. White House spokesman Sean Spicer pushed back once more on Tuesday against the tide of criticism. 'This is not a Muslim ban. It's not a travel ban,' he told reporters. 'It's a vetting system to keep America safe. That's it. Plain and simple.' Trump received a vote of support on Tuesday from House of Representatives speaker Paul Ryan, who defended the restrictions as a legitimate way to keep out potential terrorists. 'There is nothing wrong with taking a pause and making sure we had the proper vetting standards in place so that we do not have a problem like France had with Paris,' Ryan said, alluding to November 2015 suicide bombings and shootings that left 130 people dead in the French capital. The measure also appears popular with Trump's base: around 48 per cent of Americans support a freeze on immigration from 'terror prone' regions, even if it means turning refugees away, according to a Quinnipiac poll. One of them is Don Krepps, a retired construction worker in rural Ohio, 66, who voted for Trump. 'He tries to keep the bad people from coming in that don't belong here,' he told AFP. Krepps gives short shrift to the arguments of the opposition: 'If they would leave him alone, I think he would do okay, but Democrats complain about everything he does.' TO THE SUPREME COURT? The challenges have been coming from all sides. Critics including in Trump's own camp complain that the order is too broad and was rolled out hastily, reportedly without consultation with key officials who would be tasked with overseeing it. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly insisted Trump's top advisors were not caught unawares by the unveiling of the order, saying 'high-level folks in the government, attorneys as well' were consulted on the draft. Possibly the most dramatic gesture of protest to date came from Yates, who instructed Department of Justice attorneys Monday not to defend Trump's order in court, expressing doubts about its legality and morality. Trump wasted no time in crushing the rebellion. Yates - an Obama appointee held over pending confirmation of Trump's nominee Jeff Sessions - was sacked within hours and replaced by federal prosecutor Dana Boente, who vowed to defend Trump's directive. Legal challenges to the ban look set to loom large during confirmation hearings for Trump's Supreme Court nominee, whose name will be revealed on Tuesday night. Several federal judges have already filed temporary stays against the decree's implementation and attorneys general from 16 US states, including California and New York, have vowed to fight it as 'unconstitutional.' 'UNNECESSARY' At the State Department, meanwhile, diplomats declared their opposition in a 'dissent memo' delivered through an official channel. According to leaked drafts of the memo, they argued the move is a betrayal of American values. 'We are better than this ban,' they declare. The rumblings drew a scathing riposte from Spicer, who said of the diplomats, 'I think they should either get with the program or they can go.' Senior national security officials from the Barack Obama and George W. Bush administrations warned in a letter to top Trump cabinet members that the order will do long-term damage to US national security, calling it a tragically 'unnecessary' move that will fuel violent extremist propaganda. And according to industry sources, a broad coalition of US technology firms - including Google parent Alphabet, Netflix, Airbnb and Twitter - is planning a joint legal strategy challenging Trump's order, which is expected to have a large impact on a sector that employs thousands of immigrants. - AFP/de Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

Posted 01 Feb 2017 06:05 Updated 01 Feb 2017 07:55 Azzedine Najd (R) and his wife Fadwa Achmaoui look at the memorial near the site of a fatal shooting at the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre in Quebec City, Canada January 31, 2017. REUTERS/Mathieu Belanger QUEBEC CITY: In the wake of Sunday's fatal attack on a mosque in Quebec City, attention is turning to the role of populist talk radio stations and their possible role in whipping up resentment against Muslims. The day after the massacre at the Centre Culturel Islamique de Québec, one local talk show host in Quebec City told his listeners several times that two hooded men shouting 'Allahu Akbar!' had carried out the attack. 'Is this Islamophobia or an Islamist attack?' asked Sylvain Bouchard on station FM93. In fact, police that day charged a white Quebec man with six counts of premeditated murder and five counts of attempted murder with a restricted weapon for the attack. Members of Quebec's Muslim community suggest views expressed on what is known popularly as 'radio poubelle' (garbage pail radio) may be encouraging extremist views in a province which has at times struggled to cope with immigration. Quebec has seen a steady rise of right-wing groups, especially since a heated debate in 2007 about 'reasonable accommodation': how far the province should go to make immigrants feel welcome. The province last year unveiled draft legislation to ban face-coverings in the public sector in a move criticized as marginalising Muslim women and potentially inflaming anti-immigrant tensions. 'This unhealthy climate is fed by garbage pail radio where you can say anything and where the hosts vomit all over Muslims, Jews - in short, everyone who isn't 'us' but 'them,' wrote Michele Ouimet, a columnist for the La Presse daily. Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard on Tuesday would not answer directly when asked by a reporter whether the radio stations were partly to blame. But, he added: 'Words are important - written words, spoken words. People need to think carefully about that.' By Tuesday morning, Bouchard had radically changed his tune. 'Did I make a mistake? Yes,' he said on air warning listeners to beware of unverified social media messages. He also interviewed Quebec City Muslims, who called for acceptance in Quebec society, and Mathieu Fiset, a native-born Quebecer, who went from skin-head neo-Nazi to opponent of the alternative-right. Several far-right groups are active in Quebec, with their activities increasingly expanding from online discussion to physical displays of protest. Soldiers of Odin, an anti-immigrant group founded in Finland in 2015, has a particularly visible presence in Quebec City, where it has regularly patrolled streets since early last year. 'There is an underground culture of small far-right groups in Quebec,' said Chedly Belkhodja, a professor of public affairs at Concordia University in Montreal. 'They feel their values are threatened by immigrants, by the mainstream political elites accepting more immigrants,' he said. Couillard admitted Quebec society was not perfect. 'Racism, xenophobia and exclusion exist here. We have to recognise that and act together to highlight the path we want society to take,' he said. Francois Blais, the provincial government minister in charge of the Quebec region, admitted frankly that relations between locals and Muslim immigrants could be better. 'I think native Quebecers in the region still don't know enough about this community ... We are going to focus on organising activities to boost rapprochement,' he told reporters.

But less than one-third of Americans believe the move makes them 'more safe,' according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday. Posted 01 Feb 2017 05:15 Updated 01 Feb 2017 09:10 Activists gather at Terry Shrunk Plaza to protest against President Donald Trump's travel ban in Portland, Oregon, U.S. January 30, 2017. REUTERS/Steve Dipaola NEW YORK: Imposing a temporary travel ban on citizens from seven Muslim countries, President Donald Trump said the move would help protect the United States from terrorism. But less than one-third of Americans believe the move makes them 'more safe,' according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday. The Jan. 30-31 poll found roughly one in two Americans backed the ban, which also suspends admission of all refugees for 120 days, although there were sharp divisions along party lines. Trump has pushed back against critics who say the travel ban targets Muslims. He says the 'extreme vetting' is necessary to protect the country and its borders. 'This is not about religion,' Trump said in a statement after announcing the travel ban on Friday. 'This is about terror and keeping our country safe.' In the Reuters/Ipsos poll some 31 percent of people said the ban made them feel 'more safe,' while 26 percent said it made them feel 'less safe.' Another 33 percent said it would not make any difference and the rest said they don't know. Trump's executive order blocked citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and placed an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees. Some Republican lawmakers criticised Trump's order and said it could backfire by giving terrorist organizations a new recruitment message. 'This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country,' senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said in a joint statement. The Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 49 percent of Americans agreed with the order and 41 percent disagreed. Some 53 percent of Democrats said they 'strongly disagree' with Trump's action while 51 percent of Republicans said they 'strongly agree.' Democrats were more than three times as likely as Republicans to say that the 'U.S. should continue to take in immigrants and refugees,' and Republicans were more than three times as likely as Democrats to agree that 'banning people from Muslim countries is necessary to prevent terrorism.' Cheryl Hoffman, 46, of Sumerduck, Virginia said she was thrilled that Trump ordered the ban. 'I understand that the country was founded on immigrants,' said Hoffman, who participated in the poll. 'Please, I get that. But I’m worried that refugees are coming in and being supported by my tax dollars.' Another poll respondent, Veronica Buetel, 57, of Green, Ohio felt just the opposite: 'Yes, we do live in scary times, but there are other, better ways to root out terrorism.' Westy Egmont, director of the Immigrant Integration Lab at Boston College, said Americans have grown increasingly hostile towards refugees and immigrants as the influx has shifted from Eastern Europeans to people from countries like Iraq, Somalia and Afghanistan. 'The rise of those numbers, as relatively small as they are, have gathered just enough attention to set off a small reaction from people who are genuinely uncomfortable with the diversity around them,' Egmont said. Most Americans, however, don't think the country should show a preference for Christian refugees, as Trump has suggested. Some 56 percent, including 72 percent of Democrats and 45 percent of Republicans, disagreed that the country should 'welcome Christian refugees, but not Muslim ones.' On Tuesday, the Trump administration sought to clarify that citizens of U.S. ally Israel who were born in Arab countries would be allowed into the United States. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. It gathered poll responses from 1,201 people including 453 Democrats and 478 Republicans. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire sample and 5 percentage points for the Democrats and the Republicans.

Massachusetts, New York and Virginia joined the legal battle against the travel ban, which the White House deems necessary to improve national security. The challenges contend the order violated the U.S. Constitution's guarantees of religious freedom. San Francisco became the first U.S. city to sue to challenge a Trump directive to withhold federal money from U.S. cities that have adopted sanctuary policies toward undocumented immigrants, which local officials argue help local police by making those immigrants more willing to report crimes. The legal maneuvers were the latest acts of defiance against executive orders signed by Trump last week that sparked a wave of protests in major U.S. cities, where thousands of people decried the new president's actions as discriminatory. Both policies are in line with campaign promises by Republican businessman-turned-politician Trump, who vowed to build a wall on the Mexican border to stop illegal immigration and to take hard-line steps to prevent terrorist attacks in the United States. The restrictions on the seven Muslim-majority countries and new limits on refugees have won the support of many Americans, with 49 percent of respondents to a Reuters poll conducted Monday and Tuesday saying they agreed with the order, while 41 percent disagreed. Massachusetts contended the restrictions run afoul of the establishment clause of the 1st Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits religious preference. 'At bottom, what this is about is a violation of the Constitution,' Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said of the order halting travel by people with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. The order also barred resettlement of refugees for 120 days and indefinitely banned Syrian refugees. 'It discriminates against people because of their religion, it discriminates against people because of their country of origin,' Healey said at a Boston press conference, flanked by leaders from the tech, healthcare and education sectors who said that the order could limit their ability to attract and retain highly educated workers. Massachusetts will be backing a lawsuit filed over the weekend in Boston federal court by two Iranian men who teach the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth. A federal judge blocked the government from expelling those men from the country and halted enforcement of the order for seven days, following similar but more limited moves in four other states. The attorneys general of New York and Virginia also said their states were joining similar lawsuits filed in their respective federal courts challenging the ban. 'As we speak, there are students at our colleges and universities who are unable to return to Virginia,' Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring told reporters. 'This is not an action I take lightly, but it is one I take with confidence in our legal analysis.' Multiple foreign nationals have also filed lawsuits challenging the ban. They included one filed in Colorado on Tuesday by a Libyan college student and one in Chicago filed on Monday by an Iranian father of three children all living in Illinois. SANCTUARY CHALLENGE San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera filed suit over Trump's order cutting funds to cities with sanctuary policies, a move that could stop the flow of billions of dollars in aid to major U.S. population centers also including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. 'If allowed to be implemented this executive order would make our communities less safe. It would make our residents less prosperous, and it would split families apart,' Herrera said. Sanctuary cities adopt policies that limit cooperation, such as refusing to comply with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainer requests. Advocates of the policies say that, beyond helping police with crime reporting, they make undocumented immigrants more willing to serve as witnesses if they do not fear that contact with law enforcement will lead to their deportation. Both the San Francisco and Massachusetts actions contend that Trump's orders in question violate the 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which states that powers not granted to the federal government should fall to the states. Michael Hethmon, senior counsel with the conservative Immigration Reform Law Institute in Washington, called the San Francisco lawsuit a 'silly political gesture,' noting that prior federal court decisions make clear that the U.S. government 'can prohibit a policy that essentially impedes legitimate federal programs.'

Posted 01 Feb 2017 04:00 Secretary General of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) Ernesto Samper speaks during the launch of the presidential commission for the truth, justice and reparation of victims in Caracas, April 12, 2016. REUTERS/Marco Bello QUITO: U.S. President Donald Trump's migration policy and trade protectionism are threats to South America and the region must take a stand against them instead of appeasing him, the head of Unasur regional bloc said on Tuesday. Latin America has warily watched as Trump insisted he would force Mexico to pay for a wall between the United States and Mexico to curb illegal immigration and drug trafficking. He has also threatened to tax Mexican imports and tear up the regional trade deal NAFTA if he cannot renegotiate it to gain more benefits for the United States. 'This is a wall that will separate us Latin Americans from the United States because if you affect Mexico you affect Latin America,' Ernesto Samper, a former centrist Colombian president, said in a farewell speech to the South American bloc at Unasur headquarters in Ecuador. His term at the helm of Unasur formally ends on Tuesday. 'Let's be honest, the first announcements and executive orders of the new U.S. administration have to make us think, without hysteria, that we are facing a complex strategic threat,' he said. Samper called on Latin America to seek strategies and not fall into 'appeasement syndrome' as they seek to deal with Trump, who has no experience in office. Last week Peru and Colombia vowed to stand with Mexico, but otherwise the region has been largely quiet about Trump's early days in office. 'We need a prompt, serene, proportional and sovereign reaction and we need it now because tomorrow it could be too late,' said Samper.

Posted 01 Feb 2017 03:40 President of the European Council Donald Tusk speaks during a news conference in Tallinn, Estonia, January 31, 2017.  REUTERS/Ints Kalnins BRUSSELS: Donald Trump has joined Russia, China and radical Islam as a threat to the European Union, EU leaders were told on Tuesday by the man chairing a summit where they will debate relations with the United States. European Council President Donald Tusk, a conservative former premier of Poland, wrote to EU national leaders to lay out themes for discussion when they meet in Malta on Friday to discuss the future of their Union as Britain prepares to leave. In vivid language that reflects deep concern in Europe at the new U.S. president's support for Brexit, as well as his ban on refugees and people from several Muslim countries, Tusk called on Europeans to rally against eurosceptic nationalists at home and take 'spectacular steps' to deepen the continent's integration. Saying the EU faced the biggest challenges of its 60-year history, Tusk named an 'assertive China', 'Russia's aggressive policy' towards its neighbours and 'radical Islam' fuelling anarchy in the Middle East and Africa as key external threats. These, 'as well as worrying declarations by the new American administration, all make our future highly unpredictable,' he said. Laying out issues leaders may address in a 60th anniversary declaration at Rome in March, Tusk said the EU unity built after World War Two and the Cold War was needed 'to avoid another historic catastrophe'. He also said Americans should not weaken Transatlantic ties fundamental to 'global order and peace'. 'The disintegration of the European Union will not lead to the restoration of some mythical, full sovereignty of its member states, but to their real and factual dependence on the great superpowers: the United States, Russia and China,' Tusk wrote to the EU leaders. 'Only together can we be fully independent.' CAUTION TEMPERS DISMAY Senior officials discussed a possible EU response to Trump at a meeting in Brussels on Monday where some governments stressed that Europeans should not be hasty to alienate a key ally, diplomats said. 'We don't want to get fired,' one senior EU diplomat said in reference to Trump's reality TV catchphrase. Another said that because the full U.S. administration was not yet in place, Europeans should be cautious: 'No government in Europe can respond in a coherent manner to this series of orders and tweets,' the diplomat said. Yet after 11 days in office, Trump and his aides have stirred concern in Europe due to their doubts about NATO and countering Russia in Ukraine, as well as over free trade. The Socialist finance minister of France, a nation long sceptical of U.S. market economics, said on Tuesday Washington seemed set on protectionism that was a 'grave risk to the world trade order'. Friday's summit could also expose tensions with British Prime Minister Theresa May, who will attend a morning session on efforts to curb migrants heading for Europe from Libya but will leave before the other 27 discuss post-Brexit reforms. British and EU officials said they expect May to attend a lunch where all 28 leaders will discuss 'international challenges', including Trump. But May's embrace of Trump by way of a visit to Washington last week and push for a post-Brexit UK-U.S. trade deal have irritated London's continental partners. Some were also annoyed by a British announcement that its citizens who also hold passports from the seven states on Trump's banned list could enter the United States. That, diplomats said, risked breaking EU rules on equal treatment for EU citizens. Washington later said it would accept all EU passports.

REUTERS/Brian Snyder Mohamad Ali, President and CEO of Carbonite, speaks after Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced the state will join a lawsuit challenging U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order travel ban in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., January 31, 2017. REUTERS/Brian Snyder BOSTON: Massachusetts on Tuesday joined a legal effort to block U.S. President Donald Trump's order banning travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, which the state's attorney general has said is unconstitutional. Attorney General Maura Healey, a Democrat, said her office was joining the lawsuit filed in federal court on Friday challenging the ban and also filing its own lawsuit seeking to have the ban struck down. Over the weekend, a federal judge in Boston, home to Logan International Airport, blocked Trump's order from being enforced for seven days. 'During his campaign, President Trump called for a 'complete shutdown on Muslims entering the U.S.' On Friday he acted to make good on that promise,' Healey told reporters at her Boston office. 'Over the past three days my office has closely reviewed the language of the order and its many impacts ... the executive order is harmful, discriminatory and unconstitutional. It discriminates on the basis of religion and national origin.' Massachusetts is following the lead of Washington state, which said on Monday it would file a lawsuit in federal court challenging the ban on constitutional grounds. Trump's order halted travel by people with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, and stopped resettlement of refugees for 120 days. In an interview with a Christian broadcaster over the weekend, Trump said he would give preference to Syrian Christians seeking refugee status. The White House has described the ban as necessary 'to protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States.' Thousands of people took to the streets and airports of major U.S. cities over the weekend protesting the action, which has provoked a global backlash including from U.S. allies who view the ban as discriminatory. The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion. On Monday, Trump fired acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates after she took the rare step of defying the White House and refused to defend the new travel restrictions. Yates said the Justice Department would not defend the order against court challenges as she did not believe it would be 'consistent with this institution's solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right.' She said she was not convinced the order was lawful. Federal judges in five states blocked U.S. authorities over the weekend from enforcing Trump's order. U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs of Massachusetts took the strongest action by barring the detention or removal of approved refugees, visa holders and permanent U.S. residents entering from the seven countries for seven days. Her order also stopped federal officials from expelling from the country two Iranian men who teach at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth.

REUTERS/Brian Snyder WASHINGTON: Nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries temporarily barred from the United States by President Donald Trump's executive order may be blocked indefinitely, and others might be added to the list, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said on Tuesday. Under the order released on Friday, travellers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen may not enter the country for at least 90 days while Kelly and others determine whether there is enough information available to screen them. 'Some of those countries that are currently on the list may not be taken off the list anytime soon, if they are countries that are in various states of collapse, as an example,' Kelly told a press conference. Kelly said others may be added if it is determined they 'could tighten up their procedures' to ensure more secure vetting. Several lawsuits have been filed blocking portions of the order, which drew harsh criticism from some of Trump's fellow Republicans, Democrats, human rights organizations and some Western U.S. allies. Vice President Mike Pence was closely questioned about the order by Republican senators during their weekly caucus lunch. 'Obviously what happened Friday, they have to understand, was not well done,' Republican Senator Bob Corker told reporters. '... There are a lot of issues here that I don't think were well thought through.' Confusion mounted during the weekend as U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a division of the Department of Homeland Security, rushed to brief airlines and customs agents about how to implement Trump's order. The executive action was not explicit about how to handle a wide range of people trying to enter the United States, including permanent residents, students and even Iraqi pilots training to protect U.S. troops. Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan told reporters he had briefed appropriate parties 'within two hours' of the order. Kelly said he knew the order was coming and 'had people involved in the general drafting of it.' But a Department of Homeland Security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Customs and Border Protection officers had no advance notice of the order or how to respond. ANSWERING QUESTIONS Some issues were addressed on Tuesday. Kelly said people from the seven targeted nations who hold dual citizenship would be allowed to enter the United States on the passport of a non-restricted nation, which had been uncertain. The executive order also stopped the resettlement of refugees for 120 days. But the administration granted waivers to 872 'in transit' who will be arriving this week. Kelly came to the U.S. Capitol later on Tuesday to brief congressional leaders and the heads of national security committees about the order. He was peppered with questions from both Republicans and Democrats concerned about the lack of planning. Senator Claire McCaskill, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said Kelly made clear the White House is happy with the order, and that the administration had not wanted to wait to address details about its implementation. 'It was pretty clear that the president wanted this executive order put in place, and he wanted it implemented immediately. And it's not going anywhere,' she told reporters. Since the order, 721 travellers with visas from the seven countries were denied boarding U.S.-bound flights, according to McAleenan. The department has also processed 1,060 waivers for legal permanent residents, such as green card holders. Kelly said immigration and customs officials were in compliance with court orders and no agent knowingly or intentionally violated them. The Trump administration also sought to clarify on Tuesday that citizens of U.S. ally Israel who were born in Arab countries would be allowed into the United States. The U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv said a valid U.S. visa in an Israeli passport would still be valid even if the passport holder was born in one of the seven countries.

REUTERS/Baz Ratner Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivers a speech at a Cyber Security Conference in Tel Aviv, Israel January 31, 2017. REUTERS/Baz Ratner JERUSALEM: Israel's president told his Mexican counterpart on Tuesday that he was 'sorry for the hurt' over a tweet in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to praise U.S. President Donald Trump's plans to build a wall on the Mexican border. In a tweet on Saturday that drew a rebuke from Mexico, the right-wing Netanyahu wrote: 'President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.' Netanyahu had earlier sidestepped Mexico's demand for an apology and echoed previous Israeli explanations - rejected as insufficient by Mexico's foreign minister on Monday - of his remarks on Twitter. He said his comments did not refer to ties between the United States and its southern neighbour. The office of President Reuven Rivlin, whose post is largely ceremonial, issued a statement taking a more conciliatory line. 'I am sorry for any hurt caused as a result of this misunderstanding, but we must remember that we are talking about a misunderstanding, and I am sure that we can put the issue behind us,' Rivlin was quoted as telling Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. Mexico's foreign ministry acknowledged Rivlin's apology. The ministry said Pena Nieto told Rivlin the tweet had upset Mexico and its Jewish community, before adding that Mexico wanted to maintain its friendship and cooperation with Israel. On Monday, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said he thought an apology would be 'appropriate' for Netanyahu's tweet while noting that Israel was a close friend of Mexico. Trump's planned border wall, which he says will keep out illegal immigrants, along with his threat to impose punitive taxes against Mexico to rebalance trade, has brought about the worst crisis in U.S.-Mexican relations for decades. Trump signed an executive order last week ordering construction of the wall. Netanyahu, in public remarks on Monday, said that in his tweet he had been referring to Trump's praise for the barrier Israel constructed along the Egyptian frontier, a fence with electronic sensors that has largely halted the influx of African migrants. 'I did point out the remarkable success of Israel's security fence. But I did not comment about U.S.-Mexico relations. We've had, and will continue to have, good relations with Mexico,' Netanyahu said in English at a cybersecurity conference in Tel Aviv on Tuesday. Political commentators and opposition politicians in Israel said Netanyahu's tweet had needlessly thrust Israel into the U.S.-Mexican feud. At the Tel Aviv conference, Netanyahu said that Israeli-Mexican ties 'are much stronger than any passing disagreement or misunderstanding'.

Posted 01 Feb 2017 01:40 James Ibori, former governor of Nigeria's Delta State, speaks after a court hearing outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Britain, January 31, 2017. REUTERS/Estelle Shirbon LONDON: Former Nigerian oil state governor James Ibori, who was recently released from a British prison after serving a sentence for corruption, has signalled a possible political comeback in Africa's most populous country. As governor of Delta State from 1999 to 2007, Ibori became one of Nigeria's most powerful men and enjoyed a millionaire lifestyle, with luxury homes in several countries. He was later extradited to Britain, where he pleaded guilty in 2012 to 10 counts of fraud and money-laundering. The case was initially hailed as a high point in the fight against corruption, although it has since become bogged down in allegations of misconduct by British authorities. In line with normal British practice, Ibori was released in December after serving half of his 13-year sentence, taking into account pre-trial detention. He said he would return within days to Nigeria, where local media have reported that he remains influential in politics. 'What happens in African politics - you are in it until you die,' Ibori told Reuters in London on Tuesday. 'I am a politician, I will always be a politician. I play the politics in my party and in my country for the good of my people,' he said after a court hearing, part of ongoing legal proceedings in his case. Nigerian media reported that Ibori's release had prompted dancing in the streets in parts of Delta State. A video later surfaced on YouTube of Ibori being feted in London by supporters including a sitting Delta State senator who said, to cheers, that Ibori had 'made' the careers of several prominent Nigerian politicians while in prison. Ibori declined to say whether this was true. 'The prison telephone is meant for keeping in touch ... so you can reintegrate when you come out,' he said. Asked if he would run for office again, Ibori said he was barred from doing so for 10 years because of his conviction, but that he intended to appeal to have that conviction overturned. The appeal would center on an allegation, made by one of Ibori's former associates, that a British police officer had taken bribes in return for inside information on the case before Ibori's conviction, and that prosecutors had covered it up. British police say the allegation was investigated, resulting in no arrests or charges. The state prosecution service says material supporting the allegation exists and it initially failed to disclose that to Ibori's defence team, but it is confident Ibori's conviction remains valid. Court proceedings are ongoing.

(REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni/Files) NEW YORK: US talk show host Ellen DeGeneres on Tuesday (Jan 31) took a subtle dig at US President Donald Trump's immigration ban by explaining the plot of her hit animated movie 'Finding Dory'. DeGeneres, who voices the forgetful fish Dory on a mission to find her parents in the United States, noted that 'Finding Dory' was screened at the White House on Saturday, the day after Trump signed an executive order banning refugees and travellers from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States. Speaking to the audience of 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show' in a segment aired on Tuesday, she mentioned the protests sparked by Trump's order. She said she didn't want to get political so she talked instead about the plot of the 2016 film, which has taken in US$1 billion at the global box office. In the movie, Dory and her friends arrive in America, where they find themselves stuck behind a large wall keeping Dory from finding her parents. 'They all have to get over the wall and you won't believe it, but that wall has almost no effect in keeping them out,' DeGeneres said. Trump has also pledged to build a wall on the US border with Mexico to keep out undocumented immigrants. Dory crosses the border but is still separated from her family. Luckily for her, DeGeneres said, other animals are willing to help Dory and bring her into their world. 'Animals that don't even need her. Animals that don't have anything in common with her,' DeGeneres said. 'They help her, even though they're completely different colours. Because that's what you do when you see someone in need, you help them.' 'So that is what I hope everyone watching 'Finding Dory' has learned,' she added. The remarks by DeGeneres were the latest in a series of direct and indirect attacks by celebrities on the president's immigration ban, which has caused chaos and protests at airports around the world. Actors at the Screen Actors Guild awards ceremony in Los Angeles on Sunday also took aim at the ban in fiery speeches that ranged from personal experiences as immigrants or Muslims to calls for solidarity. - Reuters Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

REUTERS/Francois Lenoir LUXEMBOURG: European Union states may deny asylum to people who have been involved in a terrorist organisation even if they have not actually committed or plotted violent acts, the EU's top court ruled on Tuesday. The Court of Justice upheld a ruling by the Belgian Council of State, which had rejected an asylum claim five years ago by Mostafa Lounani, a Moroccan convicted and jailed in Belgium in 2006 for his membership of a Moroccan Islamist militant group. The ECJ found that Lounani's conviction for handling fraudulent passports to send volunteers of the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group to Iraq was sufficient reason to deny him asylum under EU rules on the grounds that he had committed 'acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations'. Lounani argued that he could be persecuted if he returned home.

(AFP/NICHOLAS KAMM) LONDON: British MPs will hold a debate on Feb 20 on US President Donald Trump's state visit to Britain after 1.6 million people signed a petition calling for the trip to be downgraded. 'Parliament will debate this petition on 20 February 2017,' parliament said on its petition website. The petition reads: 'Donald Trump should be allowed to enter the UK in his capacity as head of the US Government, but he should not be invited to make an official State Visit because it would cause embarrassment to Her Majesty the Queen.' A counter petition calling for Trump to proceed with a full visit also passed the 100,000 threshold requiring MPs to consider it for debate, and it will be discussed at the same time. Thousands took to the streets of Britain on Monday in protest following Trump's decision to ban citizens and refugees from seven mainly-Muslim countries. Guests afforded a state visit are hosted by Queen Elizabeth II, who is the head of state, and they are seen as the highest expression of friendly ties between two countries. - AFP/de Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

REUTERS/Francois Lenoir DUBLIN: Ireland's cabinet is fully in favour of retaining U.S. customs pre-clearance arrangements at the country's airports, Prime Minister Enda Kenny said on Tuesday, a day after calling for a review of the arrangements. Ireland's Dublin and Shannon airports are among a handful of locations outside North America where passengers can clear customs and immigration before travelling to the United States under an international agreement between the two governments. Kenny has ordered a complete review of the arrangements following what the government described as the concern caused by President Donald Trump's curbs on immigration that are being carried out by U.S. officials at the two airports. 'The cabinet this morning were very fully in favour of retaining our pre-clearance and the Attorney General has confirmed that the issue in so far as the legality is concerned is a matter entirely for the United States courts,' Kenny told parliament. 'In so far as Ireland is concerned, we are in compliance with human rights legislation and in accordance with our own constitution.' There has so far been one case where a person was refused pre-clearance to the United States at either airport. Kenny said that person was working in Ireland and she was therefore entitled to remain in the country. The Dutch government said on Tuesday it had ended talks with the United States over allowing pre-clearance of passengers travelling from Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport following the Trump administration's decision to ban travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries.

(Photo: AFP)  WASHINGTON: Technology companies based in the Washington state area on Tuesday (Jan 31) announced their support for a lawsuit filed by the state against US President Donald Trump's travel ban . Amazon.com Inc and Expedia Inc, both of which are based in the Seattle area, will support Washington state's suit, said Attorney General for the state, Bob Ferguson. Another Washington state company, Microsoft Corp, said it has been cooperating with the Attorney General's Office to provide information about the order's impact 'in order to be supportive'. 'To our employees in the US and around the world who may be directly affected by this order, I want you to know that the full extent of Amazon's resources are behind you,' Amazon.com's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, said in a note to employees. Pressure on Trump grew on Monday over his order banning travel from seven Muslim-majority nations, as the state of Washington announced a legal challenge. Washington will be the first state to take on the executive order, announcing an effort to sue in federal court. 'It is an insult and a danger to all of the people of the state of Washington, of all faiths,' Governor Jay Inslee, a Democrat, told reporters. He said it was important for the Trump administration to face lawsuits from the state itself, and not just cases filed by people who have been impacted by the order. Ferguson said the lawsuit would include constitutional claims, including allegations that Trump's order violates the equal protection clause and the First Amendment. Those arguments are also being used in other lawsuits filed over the weekend on behalf of individuals detained at US airports. Chaos broke out over the weekend as border and customs officials struggled to put the order into practice amid loud protests at major US airports. Federal judges blocked the deportation of those detained under the order. Several other state attorneys general, including those from California and New York, have said they are considering whether to take their own legal action. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, the country's biggest Muslim advocacy group, filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than 20 people. Trump's directive on Friday put a 120-day hold on allowing refugees into the country, an indefinite ban on refugees from Syria and a 90-day bar on citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The president argues that his action will protect America from terror attacks but critics complain that it unfairly singles out Muslims, violates US law and the Constitution, and defiles America's historic reputation as a welcoming place for immigrants. US stocks suffered their biggest drop of 2017 as investors took the curb on immigration as a reminder that not all the new president's policies would be market-friendly. - Reuters/nc Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

Police raided six homes in the Madrid region and seized a gun, ammunition, manuals to cracking safes, laser devices and oxy-fuel cylinders used to cut metal, the ministry said in a statement.

On Monday, Ireland said following Trump's move the practice was under review at Irish airports.

REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch WELLINGTON: New Zealand Prime Minister Bill English called an election on Wednesday for Sept. 23 after taking over as premier in December following the unexpected resignation of his predecessor, John Key. English's centre-right National Party has governed for the past eight years and is seeking a fourth straight term, this time without the popular Key. The next election was due around September this year. A poll by Roy Morgan in January showed the National Party more than 6 percent ahead of the rival coalition of the Labour Party and The Greens, enough to comfortably win re-election. English, a political veteran who previously served as finance minister, said the government would seek to win re-election on the back of its economic record. 'The National Party will be campaigning on its strong record as a government and New Zealand's strong economic performance,' English told reporters in Wellington. New Zealand in December forecast the 2016/17 budget surplus at NZUS$473 million (273.54 million pounds), which is expected to grow to NZUS$8.5 billion by 2020/21, despite a commitment of NZUS$2 billion to repair infrastructure damaged by a major earthquake in November. New Zealand is a small, export-dependent nation which would be vulnerable to U.S. protectionism under newly-elected President Donald Trump, while domestically its central bank has warned about an overheated housing market, which is stirring voter complaints about affordability.

Posted 01 Feb 2017 06:25 Updated 01 Feb 2017 07:11 According to UNHCR, over 800 refugees were set to make America their new home, after Trump's immigration ban AFP/BULENT KILIC SYDNEY: The United States will apply 'extreme vetting' to up to 1,250 asylum seekers it has agreed to resettle as part of an agreement with Australia, a spokesman for President Trump said in the United States on Tuesday. Washington agreed a deal late last year to resettle refugees, mainly from Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq, held in Australia's processing centres on remote Pacific islands in Papua New Guinea and Nauru. Under the deal, Australia will in return resettle refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Providing details of the plan for the first time, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the deal covered many of the refugees held in the two offshore processing centres, though they have to satisfy recently tightened immigration policies. 'The deal specifically deals with 1,250 people that are mostly in Papua New Guinea being held,' Spicer told reporters in Washington. 'Part of the deal is that they have to be vetted in the same manner that we're doing now. There will be extreme vetting applied to all of them.' Trump's executive order last week suspended his nation's refugee program and restricted entry to the United States from majority-Muslim countries Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, casting doubt over the deal with Australia. Despite the restrictions, Trump on Sunday assured Australia the United States would honour its agreement to resettle the refugees. Some 1,161 men, women and children remain in indefinite detention in Manus Island and Nauru as of Nov. 30, the most recent data from Australia's Department of Immigration shows. Another 1,000 or so people are in detention in Australia, some of them asylum seekers transported to Australia for medical treatment from Manus Island and Nauru. It is not clear how many of these would be eligible under the deal with the United States. U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials have begun assessing the asylum seekers, although there is no timeline for resettlement. Australia's hardline immigration policy is a contentious issue that has drawn international condemnation from the United Nations and other rights groups, but which remains popular at home and has bipartisan political support.

Mystery surrounds the whereabouts of Xiao Jianhua, who was last seen in Hong Kong on Friday when some overseas Chinese news outlets reported he was taken by Chinese agents from the luxury Four Seasons hotel. Chinese news portal Cankao Xiaoxi, published by the official Xinhua news agency, cited Xiao's Beijing-based Tomorrow Group as saying in a statement on its verified WeChat account that the billionaire had 'not been abducted' and had not been taken to mainland China. It added he was 'currently abroad being medically treated.' The statement, dated Tuesday, was no longer available on the WeChat account when Reuters tried to verify it. It did not disclose where Xiao was, nor where he was receiving treatment. The statement also cited Xiao, who is in his mid-40s, as saying that he was a Canadian citizen, a Hong Kong resident and holds a diplomatic passport. A spokesman for Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said Canada was aware of the reports and consular officials were in contact with authorities to gather additional information and provide assistance. Further details cannot be released for privacy reasons, said spokesman Joseph Pickerill. When contacted about Xiao's case, the Hong Kong police said a report had been filed on Jan. 28, an investigation was opened into the matter and Chinese authorities had been approached to ascertain his 'situation in mainland China'. The police did not identify Xiao by name, but said 'family members' requested the case be closed a day later. Police will continue to look into the matter. Xiao, who runs financial group Tomorrow Holdings, is ranked 32nd on the 2016 Hurun China rich list, China's equivalent of the Forbes list, with a net worth of US$5.97 billion (£4.7 billion). While Xiao's circumstances remain unclear, some media outlets have drawn parallels with the disappearance more than a year ago of five Hong Kong-based booksellers who had published books critical of China's leaders. Calls to the Ministry of Public Security in Beijing went unanswered with China in the middle of the week-long Lunar New Year holiday. It was not immediately clear how Xiao had left Hong Kong. Hong Kong's Security Bureau said in a statement to Reuters police were investigating.

Posted 01 Feb 2017 04:11 Since Rodrigo Duterte took office police have reportedly killed 2,551 people while nearly 4,000 others have died in unexplained circumstances, according to official figures. (AFP/NOEL CELIS) MANILA: Philippine police may have committed crimes against humanity by killing thousands of alleged drug offenders or paying others to murder as part of President Rodrigo Duterte's drug war, Amnesty International said on Wednesday. An Amnesty report, which followed an in-depth investigation into the drug war, also outlined what it said were other widespread police crimes aside from extrajudicial killings that mainly targeted the poor. 'Acting on orders from the very top, policemen and unknown killers have been targeting anybody remotely suspected of using of selling drugs,' Rawya Rageh, a senior crisis adviser for Amnesty, told AFP. 'Our investigation shows that this wave of extrajudicial killings has been widespread, deliberate and systematic, and therefore may amount to crimes against humanity.' Among a litany of alleged crimes, Amnesty accused police of shooting dead defenceless people, fabricating evidence, paying assassins to murder drug addicts and stealing from those they killed or the victims' relatives. It also said police were being paid by their superiors to kill, and documented victims as young as eight years old. 'The police are behaving like the criminal underworld that they are supposed to be enforcing the law against,' the report said. Duterte won presidential elections last year after promising during the campaign to eradicate drugs in society within six months by killing tens of thousands of people. 'MURDEROUS WAR ON POOR' On one occasion Duterte vowed that 100,000 people would be killed and so many bodies would be dumped in Manila Bay that the fish there would grow fat from feeding on them. Duterte launched his crackdown immediately upon taking office seven months ago. Since then, police have reported killing 2,555 people while nearly 4,000 others have died in unexplained circumstances, according to official figures. As president, Duterte has repeatedly urged police to kill drug users as well as traffickers. Duterte said in December he had personally killed people when he was mayor of a southern city to set an example for police. Three months earlier he said he would be 'happy to slaughter' three million drug addicts, and likened his campaign to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler's efforts to exterminate Jews in Europe. The Amnesty report said Duterte had incited the police to carry out a murderous war on the poor, and warned that the International Criminal Court would need to start investigating unless Philippine authorities did not stop it soon. 'The police killings are driven by pressures from the top, including an order to 'neutralise' alleged drug offenders, as well as financial incentives. They have created an informal economy of death,' the report said. Amnesty said it investigated the deaths of 59 people, and found the majority of them were extrajudicial killings. 'I WILL SURRENDER, SIR' In a number of cases witnesses to killings or victims' relatives told Amnesty that the person shot dead was unarmed and had not resisted arrest. Police also planted drugs and weapons that they later 'seized' as evidence, Amnesty said. 'I will surrender, I will surrender, sir,' Gener Rondina, 38, told police after they broke into his home in the central city of Cebu, a witness told Amnesty. Rondina then knelt and raised his arms behind his head but police then shot him dead, Amnesty said, citing the witness. When family members were allowed into the house six hours after Gener was shot, valuables including a laptop, watch and money were missing, according to Amnesty. Police alleged Rondina had a gun and they acted in self defence, and the method of killing as well as the justification was typical of the drug war, Amnesty said. Amnesty also warned that the lists of drug suspects that police were using to target people were deeply flawed. This was partly because many people were placed on the lists simply after being reported by fellow community members, without any further investigation, according to Amnesty. Duterte had until this week been unrepentant in response to criticism of his drug war and the police, insisting he was acting within the law but that extreme measures must be taken to stop the Philippines from becoming a narco state. After a series of scandals emerged over the past month in which police were caught committing murder, kidnapping, extortion and robbery, Duterte this week ordered them to stop all activities related to the drug war. He described the police force as 'corrupt to the core' and vowed to cleanse it. But he also vowed the drug war would continue until the last day of his term, in 2022. He said police would return to the drug war after he reorganised the force and, in the meantime, the military would become more involved. - AFP/de Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

Posted 01 Feb 2017 00:21 It is against Hong Kong's constitution for mainland agents to operate in the territory. (AFP/Anthony WALLACE) Financier Xiao Jianhua, founder of Beijing-based Tomorrow Group, was staying long-term at Hong Kong's luxury Four Seasons hotel, according to reports in overseas Chinese-language media. Xiao, who is usually looked after by a group of female bodyguards, was led away from an apartment at the hotel by Chinese security agents, the Financial Times reported, citing a person familiar with the investigation. It is unclear why Xiao may have been targeted, but it will add to fears that Chinese authorities are increasingly interfering in semi-autonomous Hong Kong. It is against Hong Kong's constitution for mainland agents to operate in the territory. But after the disappearance of five city booksellers in 2015, there were widespread accusations those restrictions had been breached as one of the men, Lee Bo, went missing from Hong Kong. All five were involved in publishing salacious titles about the Chinese leadership and resurfaced on the mainland. Hong Kong police confirmed they had received a 'request for assistance' concerning a mainland citizen on Saturday when asked about Xiao's case. On Sunday, a family member requested the report be withdrawn, saying the person had contacted them and was safe, a police statement said. It added the person had entered the mainland through a Hong Kong boundary control point. Tomorrow Group posted a message on its WeChat account on Monday, purportedly from Xiao, saying he was taking a break because he was ill. It has since been removed. 'Regarding the reports on me in recent days, I have to say that I, Xiao Jianhua, have been recovering from a sickness outside the country,' the message said. 'Currently everything is fine,' it added, saying the company was running 'normally'. Xiao is reported to have come to Hong Kong in 2014, two years after Chinese President Xi Jinping started a much-publicised anti-corruption drive. He has denied that he was ever the target of an investigation. Chinese-language news site Boxun said Xiao had been tipped off that a special investigative unit was about to abduct him when he was still in mainland China. Hong Kong's Apple Daily said on Tuesday that Xiao had been taken over the border between Hong Kong and mainland China with his wife, who then returned and reported the case to police and media. She then said Xiao had contacted her and did not want to exaggerate the incident, according to the report. - AFP/de Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

Posted 01 Feb 2017 00:05 Maria Isabelita Espinosa, mother of teenager Sonny Espinosa, who according to the police is one of the seven people shot dead by suspected vigilantes at a house storing illegal narcotics, cries during her son’s funeral in Caloocan city, Metro Manila, Philippines January 8, 2017. REUTERS/Romeo Ranoco MANILA: A wave of drugs-related killings in the Philippines appears to be 'systematic, planned and organised' by authorities and could constitute crimes against humanity, according to an Amnesty International report released on Wednesday. Amnesty said its investigation into President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs was based on 59 drug-related killings in 20 cities and towns. The agency said it concluded most appeared to be extra-judicial killings, and police accounts of shootouts and deaths during operations were 'startlingly similar', and often far different to witness testimony. The release of the report comes amid uncertainty over the anti-drugs crackdown and a government suspension on Monday of all police operations due to rampant corruption. The Philippine Drugs Enforcement Agency (PDEA) has now been given the lead role in the campaign. Duterte made the decision after a security meeting on Sunday triggered by the kidnap and killing of a South Korean businessmen by drugs squad police. He said the incident, which took place at the headquarters of the Philippine National Police (PNP), had embarrassed the country and dented the image of the police. Amnesty said the vast majority of the killings it investigated 'appear to have been extra-judicial killings - unlawful and deliberate killings carried out by government order or with its complicity or acquiescence'. 'The Duterte administration's relentless pressure on the police to deliver results in anti-drug operations has helped encourage these abusive practices,' the report said. The Presidential Communications Office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Amnesty's findings. The government has denied sponsoring extra-judicial killings, or police collaboration with assassins. The investigation by the London-based advocacy group was carried out mainly in November and December and was completed in January. It said it interviewed 110 people and included witness accounts of victims being shot dead despite having shouted they would surrender. It said it also found 'strong evidence' of links between the authorities and unknown gunmen, as well as connections between cursory and speculative drugs 'watch lists' created by local officials, and the people killed by police. Amnesty's report included numerous references to a series of Reuters stories and investigations into the war on drugs in the Philippines (http://reut.rs/2jPSgSn). The latest police data shows 7,669 people have been killed since Duterte unleashed his war on drugs seven months ago, 2,555 in police operations, which the PNP says were all in self-defence. The other deaths are classified as investigated, or under investigation. Human rights groups believe most of those are drugs-related, carried out by vigilantes or hit men. Amnesty's top recommendation to Duterte was to 'immediately order an end to all police operations involving unnecessary or excessive use of force', especially lethal force. It said police should suspend officers suspected of unlawful killings, planting evidence or involvement with hit men, and thoroughly investigate paid killings. It recommended Duterte appoint a new independent head of police internal affairs and the justice ministry prevent intimidation of witnesses and victims and set up a task force to prosecute extrajudicial killings. 'The Philippine government needs to urgently adopt a different approach to drugs and criminality,' it said. 'The impunity that currently reigns has facilitated killing on a massive scale, hitting the poorest and most marginalised segments of the population in particular.'

REUTERS/Akhtar Soomro LAHORE, Pakistan/ISLAMABAD: Pakistani supporters of Islamist leader Hafiz Saeed staged small protests on Tuesday and condemned the United States, after police detained the accused architect of an attack on the Indian city of Mumbai that killed 166 people in 2008. Saeed, pointed to by critics as evidence of Pakistan's reluctance to crack down hard enough on militants, was held late on Monday at the headquarters of his charity before being placed under house arrest at his home in the eastern city of Lahore. He denies involvement in the Mumbai attack. The move follows a U.S. visa ban by President Donald Trump aimed at countries deemed linked to terrorism, and, while Pakistan was not named, a Pakistani official said worry over the new administration was a factor in the decision. Pressure from key ally China may also have played a role, according to senior Pakistani officials, who say Beijing has for months been quietly lobbying Islamabad to crack down on Saeed and other Islamist leaders. 'Release Hafiz Saeed! ... Anyone who is a friend of the U.S. is a traitor!' chanted about 150 members of Saeed's Islamic charity Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) in the southern city of Karachi. About 500 protesters shouted similar slogans outside the provincial assembly in Lahore. Demonstrations also were held in Islamabad, according to the JuD, which the United States says is a front for the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militant group blamed for the Mumbai attack. Saeed founded LeT in the 1990s but later distanced himself from it. Arch-rival India was sceptical that Pakistan would bring Saeed to justice, pointing out that he had been detained before and released. 'Only a credible crack down on the mastermind of the Mumbai terrorist attack and terrorist organizations involved in cross border terrorism would be proof of Pakistan's sincerity,' said a statement from India's Ministry of External Affairs. BRINK OF WAR India has been demanding action against Saeed since the Mumbai raid by 10 gunmen from Pakistan, who infiltrated the city by boat and killed 166 people in a rampage that included attacks on two luxury hotels, a Jewish centre and a train station. The attack brought nuclear-armed Pakistan and India closer to war, although Islamabad denied any state involvement. Pakistan's military has long been accused of sponsoring LeT and other anti-India militants, a charge it rejects. Saeed was placed under house arrest just after the Mumbai attacks but was released six months later when a court ruled there was insufficient evidence against him. In recent months, Saeed has been holding regular news conferences to denounce a security crackdown in the Indian-controlled part of the divided Kashmir region. 'If they believe that they can throw the Kashmir issue into the background through our arrests and our confinement, that is not possible,' Saeed said as he was being led away by police. U.S. PRESSURE, CHINESE PERSUASION Saeed accused the government of bowing to pressure from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the United States. 'This is taking place because of Modi's insistence, Trump's pressure and Pakistan's helplessness,' Saeed told reporters. The United States has listed both the LeT and the charity as 'foreign terrorist' organisations and has a US$10 million reward for information leading to Saeed's arrest. The Pakistani government has not officially commented on why it acted now. A senior defence ministry official said the government had not been contacted by the new U.S. administration, but it had been feeling American pressure on the issue. 'Trump is taking hard decisions against Muslim countries, there is open talk of actions against Pakistan also. So yes, this was a consideration,' said the official, who declined to be identified. Several other government officials have said recently that long-time ally China has been working to persuade Pakistan to act against wanted militants such as Saeed. Officials in Beijing did not respond to queries on Tuesday, which falls during the Lunar New Year holiday. Since 2007, Pakistan has been battling the Pakistani Taliban and other militants seeking to impose strict Islamic law. But critics say it has targeted only militants who attack its own state, not those active in neighbouring Afghanistan and India, such as the Afghan Taliban, Haqqani network and LeT.

(Photo: Facebook/AnnuarMusa) KUALA LUMPUR: The chairman of Malaysia's Ministry of Rural and Regional Development (MARA), Annuar Musa, has been asked to take a temporary leave of absence as he is under investigation for graft and alleged abuse of power, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) announced on Tuesday (Jan 31). An MACC statement said that the decision was made during an emergency meeting by MARA's board. Annuar has also been suspended as the chair of Mara Investments (PMB). The allegations relate to the sponsorship of football team Kelantan FA, which Mr Annuar had been president of until November last year. Mr Annuar, who is also the UMNO information chief and MP of Ketereh, had come under the spotlight earlier this year after Johor's Crown Prince Ismail Ibrahim accused him of abusing his position at MARA to force PMB to sponsor the club along with Universiti Kuala Lumpur.  MACC indicated that an investigation over governance matters will be done separately by MARA's internal audit team. The corruption watchdog also warned the public against speculation on the case and asked to be given space for the investigation to be conducted.   - CNA/hs Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

(Photo: AFP) DHAKA: A young Bangladeshi girl with bark-like warts growing on her face could be the first female ever afflicted by so-called 'tree man syndrome', doctors studying the rare condition said Tuesday (Jan 31). Ten-year-old Sahana Khatun has the tell-tale gnarled growths sprouting from her chin, ear and nose, but doctors at Dhaka's Medical College Hospital are still conducting tests to establish if she has the unusual skin disorder. Less than half a dozen people worldwide have epidermodysplasia verruciformis but none so far have been women, said Samanta Lal Sen, the head of the hospital's burn and plastic surgery unit. 'We believe she is the first woman,' Sen told AFP. Her father, a poor labourer from Bangladesh's rural north, said he didn't worry too much when the first warts appeared on his daughter's face about four months ago. But as the growths spread rapidly he grew concerned and brought Khatun from their village to the capital Dhaka for treatment. 'We are very poor. My daughter lost her mother when she was only six. I really hope that the doctors will remove the barks from my beautiful daughter's face,' her father Mohammad Shahjahan told AFP. Another of Khatun's doctors said the young patient was displaying a milder form of the disease, and it was hoped she would make a quicker recovery than those in the more advanced stages. The hospital has been treating one man with a serious case of the disease for the better part of a year, conducting 16 surgical procedures to remove giant warts from his hands and legs. Huge growths weighing five kilogrammes (11 pounds) each had consumed the hands of 27-year-old Abul Bajandar, the first recorded Bangladeshi to be suffering from the disease. His plight has captured national attention and the interest of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who promised the patient would receive treatment free of charge. Doctors told AFP last month that for the first time in a decade, Bajandar had been able to touch his wife and daughter, and was almost ready to leave the ward. - AFP Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

(Photo: AFP)  MANILA: President Rodrigo Duterte said Tuesday (Jan 31) he has asked China to send sea patrols to help stop Islamic militants abducting sailors and attacking vessels off the southern Philippines. Duterte said he would like Beijing to dispatch a fleet like it did in 2009 when it sent a naval convoy to the Gulf of Aden to protect Chinese ships from Somali pirates. 'I also asked China if they can patrol the international waters without necessarily intruding into the territorial waters of countries,' Duterte said in a speech to newly promoted Filipino generals. 'Grey ships are not really needed,' he said, an apparent reference to warships. 'I said even coast guard cutters would do, just to patrol, like what they did in Somalia.' Manila has said militant groups are trying to establish an Islamic State-backed caliphate in Southeast Asia that would include the Philippines' southern island of Mindanao. Duterte pointedly made his appeal for help to China rather than the United States, which has traditionally been the country's main defence ally. Since his election last year, Duterte has responded to US criticism of his deadly war on crime by pivoting away from America and moving closer to China, despite ongoing territorial disputes between the two. Abu Sayyaf, one of the groups seeking to set up a caliphate, began kidnapping sailors in waters between Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines last year, taking several dozen hostages and attacking cargo ships. Indonesia has warned the region could become the 'next Somalia' and the three later pledged coordinated patrols. The International Maritime Bureau said this month the number of maritime kidnappings hit a 10-year high in 2016, with waters off the southern Philippines becoming increasingly dangerous. - AFP Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

(Photo: REUTERS/Ezra Acayan) MANILA: Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said Tuesday (Jan 31) he had ordered all police to stop prosecuting his deadly war on drugs as he sought to cleanse the force of widespread corruption. However the crackdown, which has seen more than 6,000 people killed in seven months, was set to continue with Duterte ordering the military and a drug enforcement agency under the president's office to carry on. 'I have ordered the police to stop all operations,' Duterte said during a speech to give military awards at the presidential palace. 'No policemen in this country anywhere is allowed to enforce laws related to the drug campaign.' Duterte's comments came a day after he described the police force as 'corrupt to the core', following a series of scandals in which officers were accused of using the drug war as cover for murder, kidnapping, robbery and extortion. Duterte said then he planned to 'cleanse' the police force before allowing it to return to the drug war frontlines, while in the meantime the Drug Enforcement Agency would take the lead with the support of the military. Duterte also on Monday extended the timeframe for his drug war until the end of his term in 2022. Previously he had imposed a deadline of March this year. Duterte won presidential elections last year after promising during the campaign to eradicate drugs in society by killing tens of thousands of people. Since then, police have reported killing more than 2,550 people and nearly 4,000 others have died in unexplained circumstances, according to official figures. Duterte had previously been unrepentant in the face of widespread international criticism of the drug war, including accusations the police were murdering people for their own gain and organising anonymous vigilante death squads. He promised repeatedly to shield police from prosecution if they were charged with murder for killing in the drug war. But the cascading number of scandals surrounding the police in recent weeks forced Duterte to act. In one of the highest-profile scandals, anti-drug officers allegedly kidnapped a South Korean businessmen, then murdered him inside the national police headquarters as part of an extortion racket. Amnesty International said Tuesday it expected the killings to continue regardless of Duterte's decision to pull police off the drug war. 'Even as the police claim to have halted their operations, President Duterte has pledged to continue his so-called 'war on drugs',' Amnesty International's crisis response director Tirana Hassan said in a statement. 'These contradictory statements offer little hope that the wave of extrajudicial executions that has claimed more than a thousand lives a month will end.' - AFP/nc Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

(Photo: AFP / YE AUNG THU) YANGON: A Myanmar taxi driver was hailed as a national hero at his funeral on Tuesday (Jan 31), two days after he was killed trying to stop a gunman who murdered a prominent Muslim lawyer . Father-of-three Ne Win was shot dead outside Yangon airport as he chased a man who moments earlier had slain Ko Ni, an adviser to Aung San Suu Kyi, in what her party said was a political assassination. The daylight murders, in a country where political killings are rare, sent shockwaves through both Myanmar's already hard-pressed Muslim community and Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party. There were emotional scenes on Tuesday as hundreds of mourners crammed into a Yangon cemetery to bury Ne Win, whose coffin was draped in the NLD's famous fighting peacock flag. His bereaved wife was swamped as mourners, monks and NLD figures crowded around the open coffin that bore his body. 'He tried to catch an evil man without thinking for his own life,' the elderly patron of the NLD, Tin Oo, told mourners. 'I praise Ne Win today for his brave work for the country on behalf of the NLD, other democratic forces and those who want peace.' Min Ko Naing, a student leader from the crushed 1988 anti-junta protests, described the taxi driver as part of a long line of Myanmar citizens who have sacrificed for a country that suffered under years of army rule. 'Some people who give for the country become famous but there are many people who give for the country silently,' he said. The alleged assassin, 53-year-old Kyi Lin, was arrested at the scene. Police have not said what his motivations were. Ko Ni was a prominent Muslim figure who spoke out against the increasingly vocal anti-Islamic sentiments of Buddhist hardliners and criticised the military's lingering grip on power. He served as a legal adviser to Suu Kyi and had just returned from a government trip to Indonesia. Both the NLD and Ko Ni's family suspect he was targeted because of his politics , with the ruling party describing the murder as a 'terrorist act'. Eyewitnesses gave harrowing details of how Ne Win lost his life. He saw the shooting and was part of a group of airport taxi drivers who chased after the killer. 'Ne Win threw a brick at the gunman while running after him. The man turned and fired at him, and he was shot dead,' Soe Myint, another taxi driver who gave chase told the Irrawaddy news site. - AFP/nc Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

Grab said it plans to expand to more cities in Indonesia, grow its transport services and invest in a mobile payments platform. Badrodin Haiti, who was Indonesia's chief of the National Police from April 2015 to July 2016, 'brings extensive experience working with government stakeholders and ensuring aligned interests among different stakeholders,' the company said in a statement. Grab and its competitors, Uber of the United States and homegrown company Go-Jek, have faced regulatory obstacles in Indonesia. The government has ordered ride-hailing service providers to pass vehicle safety tests and get local partners, among other conditions. 'As the technology and ride-hailing sectors evolve in Indonesia, Mr. Haiti will play a guiding role to ensure Grab contributes constructively to the implementation of new transport regulations and safety guidelines,' Grab said.

(Photo: Royal Malaysia Police) KUALA LUMPUR: The counter-terrorism division of the Royal Malaysia Police's special branch has arrested three men for suspected links to Islamic State (IS). One of them is a Malaysia Airlines security officer.  The arrests were made between Jan 27 and Jan 29 in raids in the states of Pahang and Kuala Lumpur, according to a police media release issued on Tuesday (Jan 31).  The Malaysia Airlines security officer was arrested in Kuantan, the state capital of Pahang. Police said he is a 37-year-old Indonesian citizen who is also a Malaysian permanent resident. They also said he was reportedly in contact with Malaysian members of IS in Syria and was planning to join the terror group along with his wife. Police also seized books and airsoft guns during the operation.   When contacted, a Malaysia Airlines spokesperson confirmed to Channel NewsAsia that one of its security officers had been 'detained by the police to assist in an investigation'.  'The airline views the matter seriously and has taken immediate measures to ensure that the safety and security of its operations are not compromised,' the spokesperson said, adding that the airline 'has given its full cooperation to the authorities as investigation takes place urgently'.  The other suspect arrested in Kuantan, a 32-year-old security officer at a private company, had also been planning to join IS, said police. At least one shotgun was seized from him.  The third suspect was arrested in the Malaysian capital. The unemployed 38-year-old is said to be an IS supporter, who had threatened to bomb the Negeri Sembilan mufti department for allegedly not following the teachings of Islam.  According to the media release, he had earlier made death threats and threatened bomb attacks on Kuala Lumpur via his Facebook page.  Additional reporting by Amy Chew. - CNA/hs Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

Posted 31 Jan 2017 17:01 Updated 31 Jan 2017 17:04 General view shows the Kuala Lumpur city skyline as seen from the KL Tower on Aug 9, 2016. (Photo: AFP/Mohd Rasfan) KUALA LUMPUR/BANGKOK: Seeking to capitalise on US President Donald Trump's controversial new travel restrictions, companies and officials in Asia said they would target greater tourism and education ties with Muslims worried about the curbs. Trump's Friday directive put a 120-day hold on allowing refugees into the country, an indefinite ban on refugees from Syria and a 90-day bar on citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. In Muslim-majority Malaysia, the group CEO of Asia's largest budget airline, AirAsia, suggested countries in the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) could cash in. 'With the world now getting more isolationist it's time for ASEAN to start making it easier for tourists to come,' Tony Fernandes said in a tweet on Tuesday (Jan 31).     Malaysia is a popular destination for tourists from the Middle East, with nearly 200,000 arriving in 2016 from countries including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Qatar. The country is also a key destination for medical tourism and halal tourism, with food and other products largely halal-certified. In neighbouring Thailand, tourism officials said the US ban could lift visitor numbers. 'The Middle East is a big market for us, especially in the medical tourism sector. They may choose to visit Thailand more and this may also boost our sector,' Tourism Authority of Thailand Governor Yuthasak Supasorn told Reuters. SAFETY AND SECURITY Trump has presented his ban as a way to protect the United States from Islamist militants, but it has been condemned by a growing list of foreign leaders and drawn protests by tens of thousands in American cities. With concerns about safety and security building, some Asians were reconsidering US travel plans and seeking alternatives, even though their countries were not subject to the restrictions. 'When you want to travel, especially for leisure, then you want peace of mind,' said Alicia Seah, director of public relations and communications at Singapore's Dynasty Travel. 'Right now people are planning for their March-April onwards travel. They will put their travel plans (to the United States) on hold at this juncture in time.' Singaporeans may either chose to travel to the United States later in the year or explore alternative locations such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada or within Asia, she said. TOUGHER VETTING Trump has argued tougher vetting of immigrants is needed to protect America from attacks, but critics complain that his order unfairly singles out Muslims and defiles America's historic reputation as a welcoming place for immigrants. Keysar Trad, president of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils, said Trump's travel restrictions were not only hurting innocent people but were 'bringing great damage to his own economy and to the standings of Americans internationally'. 'Everyone who has relatives in America, whether they are from the countries listed or not, they are petrified of what this man is going to do to America and to their relatives,' Trad told Reuters. Some education providers had seen early signs of an impact. Rod Jones, CEO of Australian-listed education firm Navitas Ltd, said the company had seen a downturn in inquiries for their U.S.-based English language courses. 'We have started to see students back off from the US because of their concerns about potential issues they may face,' Jones told analysts on an earnings call. 'But they still want to go somewhere,' Jones added, identifying Canada and Australia as important alternatives. 'The Canadian Prime Minister has come out and said 'if the US doesn’t want you, we'd love to have you' and I think it is the approach of Australia too.' Aulia Adila, 24, a young professional in the media industry in Jakarta, had been considering the United States as an option for postgraduate study. 'When Trump had a chance of winning the election this made me reconsider going to the States to study. Now that he won, and with the Muslim ban and the new migrant policy, it's becoming even more impossible and unsafe to be in America,' Adila said. 'I'm considering another country where I'll feel safe.' - Reuters Email More Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: " .

(Photo: REUTERS/Darren Whiteside) Indonesia has entered the third phase of its tax amnesty programme , which was first launched in July 2016 to boost the country’s meagre revenue by collecting previously-unreported funds hidden by wealthy citizens abroad and at home. The country, which has long struggled to increase its tax revenue, has so far seen more than 600,000 taxpayers join the scheme, generating US$8 billion from the first two phases of the programme. The first phase, which ended in October last year, exceeded expectations by generating around US$7 billion or two-thirds of the revenue target. The second reporting period ended on Dec 31, 2016, and generated the much smaller amount of US$1 billion. About 27,000 new taxpayers have registered since the rollout of the programme. And while it remains to be seen whether Indonesia will reach its tax amnesty target of US$12.4 billion by the end of the third phase in March, the success of the first phase prompted financial observers to hail it as one of the most successful in the world. BEATING EXPECTATIONS Many, including the IMF, were initially sceptical about Indonesia’s chance of generating significant revenue from the amnesty. But the take-up of the programme has dispelled doubts. The revenue that Indonesia has generated from it is significantly higher than similar programmes that have been implemented in other countries, such as India, Greece, Germany and Canada. One of the factors that attracted many Indonesians to report their assets is the low tax rate of the programme. In the first round, the government only charged 2 per cent tax on total reported financial assets inside Indonesia and 4 per cent for assets abroad. The rate increases incrementally in subsequent phases, reaching 10 per cent for offshore assets by the third period. The OECD has criticised Indonesia’s low rates as it deemed them too generous towards tax evaders. In September, thousands of union workers in Jakarta protested against the tax amnesty scheme, lamenting that it pardons wealthy tax cheaters. But the local finance ministry believes the low rates were the driving factor for the high uptake of the programme. ADDED INCENTIVES The Indonesian government disregards the origins of the funds being reported on to ensure taxpayers take advantage of the scheme. And it ignores prior false reporting of total assets and promises confidentiality for those who participate in the amnesty programme. The first phase of the programme exceeded expectations by generating around US$7b or two-thirds of the revenue target. (Photo: AFP) But some rich businessmen such as CEO of Lippo Group James Riady have openly declared their participation and called for others to report their assets too. Indonesia’s tax amnesty programme is well-timed. By September 2017, the country will start exchanging tax information with others that are part of the OECD’s Automatic Exchange of Information initiative. This means the country will start receiving information about offshore assets owned by its residents from tax jurisdictions that are part of the initiative. As of July 2016, 101 tax jurisdictions had signed up to the programme. The initiative will mean that tax avoiders will find it hard to hide their financial information from authorities because banks would not be allowed to hide information about their non-resident customers. THE FINAL PERIOD Entering the third period, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani expects small and medium businesses to provide a significant contribution to tax revenue. While most of those taking advantage of the first phase of tax amnesty were wealthy tycoons with offshore assets, about 70 per cent of taxpayers reporting in the second period of the tax amnesty were small and medium businesses. These businesses contribute nearly US$196 billion or 55.6 per cent to Indonesia’s GDP, but revenue generated from the second phase was 10 times less than the first phase. The programme’s success thus depends on this last round of reporting. The finance minister should work with the Ministry of Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises to get the list of businesses and require them to report their assets. WIDENING THE TAX BASE The success of the tax amnesty programme so far is a welcome attempt to increase Indonesia’s tax revenue. But if Indonesia really wants to increase its tax income, it must find a way to aggressively widen its tax base. Indonesia has a population of around 260 million people but only 26 million are registered as taxpayers. This low number has contributed to the country’s budget deficit, which is expected to reach US$25 billion in 2017 or about 2.41 per cent of total GDP. The government still has a lot of work to do to educate society regarding tax compliance. One of the things it could do is connect tax compliance with moral and religious concepts - religion plays an important part in Indonesian society. Religiosity might influence people’s habits, and might make individuals reluctant to engage in tax evasion. Research has found a positive relationship between tax morale and religion in Spain and the United States, and it could function similarly in Indonesia.

Posted 31 Jan 2017 16:40 Updated 31 Jan 2017 23:46 Police officers take their oath at the Philippine National Police (PNP) headquarters in Quezon city, Metro Manila, Philippines January 30, 2017. REUTERS/Czar Dancel MANILA: Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte suggested on Tuesday he may seek military support after withdrawing the national police from his war on drugs and handing the job to a much smaller anti-narcotics agency. More than 7,600 people, mostly users and small-time dealers, have been killed since Duterte took office at the end of June, vowing to crack down on methamphetamine use. About 2,550 of the deaths were in police operations while the others were vigilante killings or were unsolved murders. The Philippine Drugs Enforcement Agency (PDEA) would run anti-drug operations, according to presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella. Its 1,800 staff are equivalent to just over 1 percent of the 160,000-strong Philippine National Police (PNP). After a high-level security meeting on Sunday, Duterte said the PNP was 'corrupt to the core'. A suspension of its drugs operations came a few hours later. Duterte is furious with the PNP for the kidnap and killing of South Korean businessman Jee Ick-joo by police drugs squad officers. Jee was killed within the PNP headquarters grounds. In a speech to soldiers on Tuesday, Duterte suggested he might need their help, saying he would be dead 'if I don't include you in the game'. The mercurial Duterte has threatened several times to invoke military rule to help his war on drugs. Last week, he appeared to rule out declaring martial law, but said he could do so if he wished. Presidential spokesman Abella could not immediately confirm whether the military, which has played a minor supporting role in the drugs war, would be given more responsibility. Armed forces spokesman Brigadier-General Restituto Padilla said military involvement was discussed at the security talks, but it was not clear what that would be. Duterte said police had been ordered to stand down from  anti-drugs operations. 'No policeman in this country anywhere is allowed to enforce laws related to the drug campaign,' he said, adding about 6,000 of them were 'into drugs'. Local radio stations, which routinely cover drug killings, said there were no reports of any deaths in what appeared to be a rare bloodless night on Monday, although police could not confirm whether or not there were casualties. Official data on Tuesday showed four additional deaths in police operations, although it was not immediately clear when those took place. The attack on the PNP is a surprise about-face by Duterte, who had been unwavering in his support for police on the front lines of his drugs war. His spokesman said the president was fully aware of PNP corruption when he gave police the lead in fighting narcotics, but the drugs problem was so big, he had no other choice. 'The president had to act, he did act, to enforce his political will,' Abella told a news briefing. 'To avoid any of the apparent corrupt activities within the organisation, he has now transferred (control) to PDEA.' TOUGH TASK The anti-drugs campaign has caused international alarm due to the high death toll and disputed circumstances of many of the killings. Human rights groups say the police have been involved in widespread extrajudicial killings. The PNP and Duterte strongly reject that. Congressman Edcel Lagman described the sidelining of police as 'a blessing' and said it was time to get tough. 'For the first time in six months there are no reports today of drug-related killings,' Lagman said. 'There should be no more kids gloves for police scalawags who deserve an iron fist.' Police officials who spoke to Reuters said there had been no written directive on the suspension of their role in the drugs war, but they were following the police chief's comments on television. 'That is good as an order,' said Senior Superintendent Roberto Fajardo at Manila's Northern Police District. 'We now go after other crimes ... that's better for us, we fight all crimes.' One senior policeman said raids and sting operations on drug sellers had stopped and police operations had shifted towards reining in wayward officers, especially those reinstated following internal investigations. 'The cleansing process will take a front seat by strengthening our counter-intelligence operations, checking lifestyles of police officers involved in drug operations,' said the officer, who requested anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to media. 'This is a huge job. I'm not sure how long will it take to do this because our Internal Affairs Service lacks manpower.'

Posted 31 Jan 2017 16:00 Updated 31 Jan 2017 16:31 At least 66,000 Rohingya have fled from Myanmar to neighbouring Bangladesh, alleging rape, murder and torture at the hands of security forces AFP/STR DHAKA: Bangladesh has resurrected a plan to relocate thousands of Rohingya Muslims fleeing violence in Myanmar's northwestern Rakhine State to a flooded island in the Bay of Bengal to prevent them from 'intermingling' with Bangladeshi citizens. The United Nations says about 65,000 people have fled the Muslim-majority northern part of Rakhine to Bangladesh since attacks that killed nine Myanmar border police on Oct. 9, sparking a heavy-handed security response in which scores were killed. Bangladesh first proposed the idea of sending the Rohingya to Thengar Char, which floods at high tide, in 2015, prompting anger among rights groups. A notice dated Jan. 26 and posted on the website of the Bangladesh government's cabinet says several committees had been formed to look at the influx of Rohingya Muslims, which the country fears could lead to law and order issues as they mix with local residents. Dhaka was preparing a list of the people who would be temporarily moved to Thengar Char before being sent back to Myanmar, the notice said. A senior official at Bangladesh's home ministry said the process to shift the Rohingya to the island would take time and that 'if that place is not livable, the government will make it livable'. Hundreds were killed in communal clashes in Rakhine in 2012, exposing a lack of oversight of the military by the administration of Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi. The Rohingya are seen by many Myanmar Buddhists as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. (Reporting by Ruma Paul; Writing by Krishna N.

Duterte on Sunday said the United States had stockpiled weapons, including tanks, in three locations in the Philippines, which could provoke China and put his country in harm's way. Duterte then threatened to scrap a defence treaty between the two allies that is crucial to U.S. strategic interests in Asia. 'We are not building a weapons depot anywhere in the Philippines,' Ambassador Sung Kim told a forum at the influential Makati Business Club, adding facilities due to be built were to store equipment for disaster response. He said the United States could not build anything on Philippine bases against the consent of the Philippine government, and its facilities are 'not related to weapons'. Philippine military officials on Monday contradicted Duterte and said his concern had been looked into, but there was nothing to back it up. Sung said he had several lengthy discussions with top security officials including the defence minister, and promised to address some concerns. He said the alliance remained robust. Duterte's spokesman, Ernesto Abella declined to say what the president's source of information was when he said American armories were being built. 'I cannot tell you that but he seems to be privy to some sort of information,' Abella told a news briefing. 'He may have come up on other confirmation that may have affected those comments.' Duterte's remarks came after the Pentagon approved upgrades and construction of barracks, runways and storage facilities this year under a 2014 Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) that the outspoken president has scorn for. The defence agreement covers rotational deployment of U.S. ships, aircraft and troops at five bases, and storage of equipment for humanitarian and maritime security missions. Duterte has said he hates having American troops on Philippine soil. He has made efforts to improve ties with China, despite a long-running dispute over rival claims in the South China Sea.

REUTERS/Toshfumi Kitamura/Pool TOKYO: Japan is hammering out plans to show U.S. President Donald Trump its firms are ready to create U.S. jobs, according to a document whose contents were revealed to Reuters, as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe prepares for a summit where automotive trade will be high on the agenda. Abe will visit Washington on Feb. 10 for the talks at which  Trump is expected to seek quick progress toward a two-way trade deal. An early draft of the document, called 'U.S.-Japan Growth and Employment Initiative', listed five areas including  infrastructure. The document, which was read to Reuters, did not mention automotive trade, which Trump has targeted as 'unfair' in an echo of complaints by Washington decades ago. The document left blanks for the numbers of jobs to be created and the scope of investment but a government source said several hundred thousand jobs could result. It also referred to the idea of buying dollar-denominated 'infrastructure bonds', a proposal that has been floated as a way Japan could take part in Trump's promised upgrade of U.S. infrastructure. Japanese officials said they were still trying to assess just what Trump wants from Japan. In addition to singling out cars, he has also lumped Japan with China and Mexico as big contributors to America's trade deficit. However, Japan's share of the U.S. global trade gap has shrunk to 9 percent from more than half in the early 1990s. Automobiles and car parts account for about three-fourths of the overall U.S.-Japan trade gap, making it an easy target. 'BUY AMERICAN' In a phone call with Abe on Saturday, Trump reiterated his pledge to create jobs in the United States and asked that the Japanese auto industry contribute, the Nikkei business daily reported, quoting unidentified Japanese government officials. Abe is expected to meet Toyoto Motor Corp CEO Akio Toyoda this week, possibly on Friday. 'Mr. Trump has made a promise to 'Buy American, Hire American',' said one former Japanese diplomat. ”Symbolically, autos are a very big player.' The renewed focus on the automotive trade has some Japanese officials and media reminiscing - and not happily - about heated U.S.-Japan auto talks more than 20 years ago. A last-minute deal in June 1995 averted U.S. tariffs on Japanese luxury cars when Japan's automakers crafted 'voluntary plans' to boost purchases of American auto parts and expand U.S. production. That allowed the Japanese government to maintain its opposition to setting official numerical trade targets while letting U.S. negotiators also claim a win. Yoshihiro Sakamoto, the top Japanese trade bureaucrat in those talks two decades ago, said such plans - drafted behind the scenes by the auto industry and trade ministry - could be a model for addressing the situation now. Some experts pointed out, however, the ministry's clout had waned since those days. 'What America wants is investment,' Sakamoto told Reuters. U.S. CAR INVESTMENTS Toyota has come under fire from Trump for plans, announced in 2015, to shift production of its Corolla sedan from Canada to Mexico. Earlier this month, Japan's top automaker said it would invest US$10 billion in the United States over the next five years, the same as the previous five years. On Monday, Honda Motor Co Ltd and General Motors Co said they would jointly produce pollution-free hydrogen fuel cell power systems in the United States from around 2020. The companies said they would invest US$85 million to add a production line at a GM battery plant in Brownstown, Michigan, and create 100 jobs. Boosting output in the United States, however, could force Japanese car makers to make tough decisions about reducing production - and jobs - back home. Central Japan Railway Company, or JR Tokai, has given the government estimates of how many jobs would be created by proposed high-speed Shinkansen railways in California and Texas and a high-tech 'maglev' railway along the U.S. east coast, a JR Tokai spokeswoman said. She declined to release the figures. Abe, who is close to JR Tokai Chairman emeritus Yoshiyuki Kasai, has touted maglev or magnetic levitation as a 'dream technology' that could link New York and Washington in under an hour.

REUTERS/Fatima El-Kareem Jakarta Police Chief Mochamad Iriawan listens  during an interview with Reuters in Jakarta, Indonesia, January 30, 2017. Picture taken on January 30. REUTERS/Fatima El-Kareem JAKARTA: Indonesian police will block a rally in Jakarta next month led by the hardline Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) if the group intends to make it political just days before an election for city governor that has raised religious tension. The FPI has led two rallies over the past year targeting the  ethnic Chinese, Christian Jakarta governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, which drew hundreds of thousands of Muslims calling for his jailing over allegations he insulted the Koran. The FPI leader, Habib Rizieq, was on Monday declared a suspect over allegations he insulted Indonesia's state ideology, Pancasila, which enshrines religious diversity in an officially secular system. Jakarta police chief Mochamad Iriawan told Reuters in an interview on Monday the FPI's plan for another rally on Feb. 11, four days before the Jakarta elections, indicated it would be political in nature, and if so, it would not be allowed. 'The end of the campaign period should not be disrupted by the planned protest,' Iriawan said. 'If the context is as they said on social media - 'we should vote for a Muslim person as our leader' - it looks like a political campaign.' The rallies late last year raised concerns among investors  that Islamist militancy and mob rule were taking hold in Southeast Asia's biggest economy. Indonesia has the world's largest Muslim population, the  majority of whom follow a moderate form of Islam. The naming of Rizieq as a suspect comes amid signs that authorities are taking a firmer stance to contain the rise of the FPI and other Islamist groups. 'BIG MESS' Purnama, who is known as Ahok and is an ally of President Joko Widodo, is contesting the Feb. 15 election against two Muslim candidates. He was named a blasphemy suspect on Nov. 16, days after the first big FPI rally, and is on trial. He denies the charge. Iriawan said the FPI had yet to apply for a permit for its rally, and the group would only be allowed to proceed if 'they just hold a prayer'. Rizieq also faces investigations into alleged blasphemy and hate speech, including remarks by him that communist symbols had been hidden in new Indonesian bank notes and comments mocking the notion that Jesus was the son of God. FPI spokesman Slamet Maarif said the group's supporters would defend Rizieq 'until the last drop of our blood'. There has been a increase in blasphemy complaints filed to police since the accusation was levelled against Purnama in October. Tobias Basuki, a political analyst at the Jakarta-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said Indonesia's laws criminalising slights against religion and the national ideology of Pancasila were being abused. 'These blasphemy laws are being used against pretty well anyone for anything,' he said. 'Frankly, they are just politically motivated plays but they are creating a big mess for Indonesia.' 'These are just concepts and we are repressing the potential for healthy debate. Meanwhile, very little is done to stop actual hate speech which threatens lives.'

REUTERS/Stringer KUALA LUMPUR: Chinese tourist Fan Li Xia and other passengers held on to the body of a dead friend for as long as they could as they trod water after a catamaran capsized in the cold waters of the South China Sea. The catamaran, carrying 27 Chinese tourists and three crew on a Lunar New Year cruise, sank on Saturday off the coast of Borneo after being battered by heavy waves while en route to the popular Malaysian holiday island of Mengalum. Three of the tourists were found dead on Sunday, while 22 people, including the captain, were rescued, many of them bleeding and heavily sunburnt. Four tourists and one crew member were missing. Fan Li Xia said the group, tied together on the catamaran in life jackets, were swept away by the current and struggled in the cold water for more than 30 hours. 'If we were found any later, I don't think I would have survived,' she told reporters at a hospital in Kota Kinabalu, capital of Malaysia’s Sabah state on Borneo. 'My friend died. We dragged his body around for half a day, but we couldn't manage any more so we had to let it go.' The Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency said the tourists were rescued by fishermen and tugboats. Military ships and aircraft were scouring the choppy waters for the missing five. Fellow survivor Yang Yaoru said their collective will helped them endure the cold. They were sharing the little food they had and urging each other to stay alive. Yang, who was on holiday with her mother, said the survivors huddled together to try to shake off the cold and did not loosen their grip. Yang said she was especially concerned about her mother, who was not a good swimmer. 'If I had died, my mother couldn't have survived by herself...I must bring my mother home,' the 24-year-old Yang told Chinese broadcaster CCTV from her hospital bed. Thousands of Chinese visitors flock to Mengalum island during the long Lunar New Year holidays. China is one of Malaysia's main sources of tourists. Ties between the two countries were strained in 2014 when Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 went missing on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Most of its passengers were from China. The search for the airliner ended this month without success. Boating accidents involving tourists are common off Sabah. Media reports said police arrested the owner of the catamaran and two crew and were investigating.

Posted 31 Jan 2017 14:15 Updated 31 Jan 2017 14:41 Chinese J-15 fighter jets waiting on the deck of the Liaoning aircraft carrier during military drills in the Bohai Sea, off China's north-east coast AFP/- BEIJING: China's second aircraft carrier is 'taking shape' after two years and nine months of construction, local media reported, a move likely to further unnerve Taiwan and other neighbours about Beijing's growing military assertiveness. Construction of The Shandong, named after a province in China's east coast, began in 2014, the APP of Shandong television and radio said in a report seen on Tuesday. The Shandong, China's first indigenous aircraft carrier, is 'taking shape', the report said. It did not give a date for completion or further details. It was being built in the northeastern port of Dalian, the Defence Ministry has said. The country's first aircraft carrier, The Liaoning, was bought from Ukraine in 1998 and refitted in China. In January 2017 a group of Chinese warships, led by The Liaoning, tested weapons and equipment in the South China Sea in what the Chinese Foreign Ministry described as routine exercises that comply with international law. The group of warships sailed through waters south of Japan and then rounded east and south of Taiwan in December on their way to the southern Chinese province of Hainan. But China is years away from perfecting carrier operations similar to those the United States has practised for decades. The eventual launch of The Shandong would further rattle self-ruled democratic Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own, as well as Asian neighbours Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam with disputed claims in the South China Sea. China and Taiwan have been diplomatic and military rivals since 1949 when Nationalist, or Kuomintang, troops lost the Chinese civil war to the Communists on the mainland and fled to the island. Bilateral trade, investment and tourism have grown significantly in the past three decades, but tensions have been simmering since the island elected President Tsai Ing-wen from the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party last year. China has vowed to attack if the island declared de jure independence.

Ko Ni, a prominent member of Myanmar's Muslim minority and legal adviser for Myanmar's ruling National League for Democracy, is seen during an interview in Yangon January 13, 2016. Phyo Thiha Cho/Myanmar Now via REUTERS YANGON: The office of Myanmar's civilian president said on Tuesday that the assassination of a lawyer advising the ruling party on amending a military-drafted constitution was likely an effort to destabilise the country. A lone gunman shot Ko Ni, 63, an adviser to the ruling National League for Democracy, in the head in front of onlookers as the widely respected Muslim advocate held his young grandson at Yangon's international airport on Sunday. 'The initial interrogation indicates the intention to destabilise the state,' the office of President Htin Kyaw said in a statement carried in the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper. It did not give details. 'Investigations are being carried out by the government to find out the truth. Security has been heightened in the aftermath of the assassination.' Authorities have detained Ko Ni's suspected killer, a 53-year-old man. He also shot and killed a taxi driver who tried to apprehend him. It remains unclear if Ko Ni was targeted for his religion or for his work toward reducing the political role of Myanmar's military. But the killing comes at a time of heightened communal and religious tensions in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where a civilian government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has been in power for 10 months after a formal transition from decades of military rule. A heavy-handed security operation in Rakhine state, a region home to many Rohingya Muslims, has led to an estimated 69,000 from the largely stateless community fleeing into neighbouring Bangladesh. Tens of thousands of people gathered in Yangon on Monday to mourn the death of Ko Ni, who was working on amending the constitution that ruling generals drafted in 2008 and which grants the army a quarter of seats in parliament and control over security ministries. Suu Kyi did not attend the funeral of her close adviser, and has not issued any statement. Separately on Tuesday, a commission investigating attacks on border posts in Rakhine State that killed nine police on Oct. 9 and their aftermath has asked for more time due to unspecified 'fresh claims' of human rights abuses, state media said. The commission was to have reported on its findings on Tuesday, including looking into allegations that soldiers committed extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests and rape of Rohingya civilians.

Trump last week issued an executive order that put a temporary ban on allowing refugees into the country, an indefinite ban on refugees from Syria, and a 90-day ban on citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. '(The policy) won't affect us directly in a big way, but it can raise suspicion especially toward Muslims,' Vice President Jusuf Kalla said, as quoted by news website Detik.com. Indonesia is home to the world's largest population of Muslims. It was not included in the list of countries whose citizens have been temporarily banned from entering the United States.

REUTERS/Caren Firouz/File Photo LAHORE, Pakistan/ISLAMABAD: Pakistani supporters of Islamist leader Hafiz Saeed staged small protests on Tuesday and condemned the United States, after police detained the accused architect of an attack on the Indian city of Mumbai that killed 166 people in 2008. Saeed, pointed to by critics as evidence of Pakistan's reluctance to crack down hard enough on militants, was held late on Monday at the headquarters of his charity before being placed under house arrest at his home in the eastern city of Lahore. He denies involvement in the Mumbai attack. The move follows a U.S. visa ban by President Donald Trump aimed at countries deemed linked to terrorism, and, while Pakistan was not named, a Pakistani official said worry over the new administration was a factor in the decision. Pressure from key ally China may also have played a role, according to senior Pakistani officials, who say Beijing has for months been quietly lobbying Islamabad to crack down on Saeed and other Islamist leaders. 'Release Hafiz Saeed! ... Anyone who is a friend of the U.S. is a traitor!' chanted about 150 members of Saeed's Islamic charity Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) in the southern city of Karachi. About 500 protesters shouted similar slogans outside the provincial assembly in Lahore. Demonstrations also were held in Islamabad, according to the JuD, which the United States says is a front for the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militant group blamed for the Mumbai attack. Saeed founded LeT in the 1990s but later distanced himself from it. Arch-rival India was sceptical that Pakistan would bring Saeed to justice, pointing out that he had been detained before and released. 'Only a credible crack down on the mastermind of the Mumbai terrorist attack and terrorist organizations involved in cross border terrorism would be proof of Pakistan's sincerity,' said a statement from India's Ministry of External Affairs. BRINK OF WAR India has been demanding action against Saeed since the Mumbai raid by 10 gunmen from Pakistan, who infiltrated the city by boat and killed 166 people in a rampage that included attacks on two luxury hotels, a Jewish centre and a train station. The attack brought nuclear-armed Pakistan and India closer to war, although Islamabad denied any state involvement. Pakistan's military has long been accused of sponsoring LeT and other anti-India militants, a charge it rejects. Saeed was placed under house arrest just after the Mumbai attacks but was released six months later when a court ruled there was insufficient evidence against him. In recent months, Saeed has been holding regular news conferences to denounce a security crackdown in the Indian-controlled part of the divided Kashmir region. 'If they believe that they can throw the Kashmir issue into the background through our arrests and our confinement, that is not possible,' Saeed said as he was being led away by police. U.S. PRESSURE, CHINESE PERSUASION Saeed accused the government of bowing to pressure from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the United States. 'This is taking place because of Modi's insistence, Trump's pressure and Pakistan's helplessness,' Saeed told reporters. The United States has listed both the LeT and the charity as 'foreign terrorist' organisations and has a US$10 million reward for information leading to Saeed's arrest. The Pakistani government has not officially commented on why it acted now. A senior defence ministry official said the government had not been contacted by the new U.S. administration, but it had been feeling American pressure on the issue. 'Trump is taking hard decisions against Muslim countries, there is open talk of actions against Pakistan also. So yes, this was a consideration,' said the official, who declined to be identified. Several other government officials have said recently that long-time ally China has been working to persuade Pakistan to act against wanted militants such as Saeed. Officials in Beijing did not respond to queries on Tuesday, which falls during the Lunar New Year holiday. Since 2007, Pakistan has been battling the Pakistani Taliban and other militants seeking to impose strict Islamic law. But critics say it has targeted only militants who attack its own state, not those active in neighbouring Afghanistan and India, such as the Afghan Taliban, Haqqani network and LeT.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria South Korean Defence Minister Han Min-Koo answers questions during a news conference inside a military headquarters in Quezon city, metro Manila September 14, 2015. REUTERS/Romeo Ranoco WASHINGTON/SEOUL: U.S. Defence Secretary James Mattis and his South Korean counterpart agreed during a phone call on Monday to strengthen their defence against 'the evolving North Korean threat,' the Pentagon said, amid reports the North may be preparing a new missile test. Mattis, who is to visit South Korea on Thursday, reaffirmed to South Korean Defence Minister Han Min-koo the U.S. commitment to defend the country and 'provide extended deterrence using the full range of U.S. capabilities,' the Pentagon said in a statement. The South Korean Defence Ministry said in a statement the two sides had agreed to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system in South Korea as planned to defend against North Korea's nuclear and ballistic capabilities. China has objected to THAAD, saying it will destabilise the regional security balance, leading to calls from some South Korean opposition leaders to delay or cancel it. Mattis's visit to the region comes amid reports that the North may be readying to test a new ballistic missile in what could be an early challenge for of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. The North also appears to have restarted operation of a reactor at its main Yongbyon nuclear facility that produces plutonium that can be used for its nuclear weapons programme, according to a U.S. think tank. North Korea has carried out a series of nuclear and missile tests in defiance of U.N sanctions. It conducted its fifth nuclear test in September. North and South are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. Mattis also met Jordan's King Abdullah at the Pentagon and expressed his deep appreciation for Jordan's contributions to the fight against Islamic State, the Pentagon statement said.
