NEW DELHI: President Pranab Mukherjee hailed the demonetisation move+ and the surgical strikes on terror launchpads across the LoC in his address to the joint sitting of Parliament on Tuesday. The President's speech also indicated that the government's third Budget, to be presented on Wednesday, may provide more funds for schemes focusing on the poor, farmers and other vulnerable groups of society. In the speech, which is the government's narrative on what it has done during the year and what it plans to do in the new financial year, the President said, 'At the core of all my government's policies is the welfare of the garib, Dalit, peedit, shoshit, vanchit, kisan, shramik and yuva. My government is guided by the Antyodaya philosophy of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya. Financial inclusion is key to poverty alleviation.' With BJP engaged in a tough political battle in five states+ , increased government spending would be a politically prudent move to assuage the poor and farmers who were hit by the demonetisation move. Terming demonetisation as a 'bold decision in the interest of the poor', the President said, 'The resilience and forbearance demonstrated by our countrymen, particularly the poor, recently in the fight against black money and corruption is remarkable.' Speaking on the surgical strikes across the LoC+ , the President said it was a decisive step to give a fitting reply to the repeated incursions on India's territorial sovereignty. 'On September 29, 2016, our defence forces successfully conducted surgical strikes at several launch pads along the LoC to prevent infiltration by terrorists. We are proud of the exemplary courage and valour displayed by our defence personnel and owe a debt of gratitude to them,' he said. India has been widely acclaimed as a bright spot in the global economy at a time when global growth has been slow, the President said. He added that inflation, balance of payments, current account deficit and fiscal deficit had consistently reduced since 2014. He said FDI and foreign exchange reserves had reached record levels and the country's macro economic fundamentals were very strong, creating a platform for sustained high growth. Prices of pulses were under control after the government took proactive steps, Mukherjee said, emphasising that the government's focus had been on 'holistic development' of the farm sector. He mentioned that the acreage under kharif and rabi crops had risen this year on account of favourable monsoon after consecutive years of drought. Mukherjee said Jammu and Kashmir had been affected by terrorism sponsored and supported from across the border. Mukherjee also said the government had fulfilled the four-decade-old demand of one rank one pension+ . During his hour long speech, the President mentioned the word poor at least 21 times and farmers and kisan nine times.

NEW DELHI: With 'jobless growth' being a persistent feature of official statistics over the past decade, the Union Budget is being keenly watched for measures to spur employment and skilling, particularly in the context of increasing urbanisation. The Budget is expected to tackle this area of concern that the Modi government has inherited from the UPA and which was highlighted by Congress in its critique of the economy released by former PM Manmohan Singh and former finance minister P Chidambaram. The government has been engaged with the issue of creating more quality jobs and this has been an important part of Niti Aayog's task and the Budget is expected to reflect initiatives to improve opportunities for the youth. BJP sources said the absorption of graduates and school finishers in the workforce was a major political concern as a large section of those in the employable age did not have adequate skills. Going by the Modi government's stated reluctance to hand out doles, the focus could be on creating facilities for training and encouraging growth in sectors that are expected to boost employment. The President's address to Parliament on Tuesday noted that the government had been working to create new avenues and make technical education more accessible to students, particularly those from economically weaker sections. ITI trainees have been provided academic equivalence of matriculation and higher secondary level through bridge courses, and initiatives like online learning offering a path to a degree are steps in the same direction. The government is looking to address a scenario where increasing urbanisation is forcing rural workforce to look for employment outside the agriculture sector. Also, there was a long felt need to reduce the percentage of the workforce dependent on a sector that contributed between 15-17percent of the GDP. The increasing 'rurban' areas represent a challenge as they are regions in transition where the traditional economy is changing. The aspirations of the younger segment of the population, whether rural or urban, are also geared to the modern economy. The skilling objective was mentioned by the President in his references to the 'har haath ko hunar' motto as he noted that an umbrella ministry was not coordinating these efforts. The PM Kaushal Vikas Yojana aims to train over one crore youth in the next four years. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

TNN | Updated: Feb 1, 2017, 02.41 AM IST Highlights The Economic Survey noted that there have been job losses, declines in farm incomes, and social disruption, especially in the cash-intensive parts of the economy due to note ban In the short run, demonetisation could also affect supplies of agricultural products like milk, sugar, potatoes and onions, the Survey said NEW DELHI: The Economic Survey admitted that demonetisation has had the effect of creating uncertainty and pushed for an 'early elimination of withdrawal limits' to help build confidence. 'Unless people have confidence that money deposited in bank accounts is freely convertible into cash, and vice versa...they will hoard it,' the Survey warned, adding that the poor would be worst hit in such a situation since the affluent would corner the limited currency available. About the immediate adverse impact of demonetisation, the Survey noted that there have been reports of job losses, declines in farm incomes, and social disruption, especially in the informal, cash-intensive parts of the economy. However, it said 'a systematic analysis cannot be included here due to paucity of macro-economic data'. It acknowledged that the cash crunch must have affected the informal economy, which could account for 50percent or more of the overall economy. The formal economy too would have suffered because workers laid off in the informal economy have bought fewer products (such as fast moving consumer goods or two wheelers) from the formal economy. Among the sectors the Survey specifically looked at, it conceded that real estate had been badly hit but expressed the view that this was not entirely a bad thing. 'An equilibrium reduction in real estate prices is desirable as it will lead to affordable housing for the middle class, and facilitate labour mobility across India currently impeded by high and unaffordable rents,' it said. In the short run, demonetisation could also affect supplies of agricultural products like milk, sugar, potatoes and onions, the Survey said. It cautioned that 'vigilance is essential to prevent other agricultural products becoming in 2017-18 what pulses was in 2015-16 in terms of supply deficiencies and consequential higher inflation'. Defending the long-term virtues of demonetisation, the Survey said it could be interpreted as a demonstration of the state's resolve to crack down on black money, showing that tax evasion would no longer be tolerated. 'Since this action has commanded support amongst the population, demonetisation shows that black money will no longer be tolerated by the wider public, either,' it added. It said the combined effects of the financial penalty cash hoarders have had to pay - either by declaring incomes they had concealed so far or by having to shell out a 'conversion' cost for turning black money white through intermediaries - and of 'social condemnation' could have a powerful and long-lasting effect on corruption and tax compliance. The tax-GDP ratio , as well as the size of the formal economy, could be permanently higher, the Survey said, adding that if it was successful it would in the long run reduce the cash-GDP and cash-deposits ratios, thereby increasing financial savings and boosting long-term growth.

TNN | Updated: Feb 1, 2017, 07.44 AM IST NEW DELHI: The Economic Survey has pointed to the fear of investigative agencies among bankers while trying to reduce or retire corporate debt as well as the political difficulty in taking over such companies. The observations accompany a pitch for a public sector asset rehabilitation agency (PARA) to take tough decisions, including write-offs of large loans crippling a significant portion of India Inc and which could affect growth. Alarm bells in the official document are ringing days after the CBI arrested five top ranking IDBI executives for their role in providing loans to Vijay Mallya's Kingfisher Airlines. PARA, proposed to be similar to a 'bad bank' (one burdened with NPAs), could help rid firms of piles of sticky loans that make many of them unviable. 'Cash flows in the large stressed companies have been deteriorating over the past few years, to the point where debt reductions of more than 50percent will often be needed to restore viability. The only alternative would be to convert debt to equity, take over the companies and sell them at a loss,' the pre-Budget document said. Pointing to the failure of banks in restructuring loans , it said that the lenders have refinanced and have been 'kicking the problems down the road', raising the recapitalisation burden for the government as more bad debt means that the Centre needs to pump more equity into public sector banks as it has bound itself to holding a minimum 51percent stake. The survey said the focus on the discourse has been on helping out banks through more equity infusion, as the lenders as well as the corporate sector have been reeling with weak finances — described as the twin balance sheet problem. The proportion of bad debt on the books of Indian banks — especially those in the public sector — is much higher than other Brics countries and South Korea. The argument for PARA is made on the grounds that companies have been grappling with deteriorating cash flows, which makes loan repayment tougher at a time when their interest obligation is already mounting. While companies have sold assets, it was to 'buy time' as they continue to 'haemorrhage'. The survey said that the key elements needed for resolution are still not in place despite several measures being announced by the RBI and the government. 'The road to resolution remains littered with obstacles, even for the most ordinary of bad debt.' Given the cost involved in setting up PARA, the survey recommended that the government and the RBI could split the burden.

However, the Trump administration can reduce the cap on H-1B visas or raise the fees or auction them, which is a source of anxiety for US tech firms, which outsource jobs mainly to India. Here's a look at how the H-1B visa program works and why tech companies are worried. 1. The US gives 65,000 H-1B visas each year and an additional 20,000 more for foreign students in US. 2. The US Department of Homeland Security said that 70 per cent of the 65,000 H-1B visas in 2014 went to Indians. 3. About 3 lakh to 3.5 lakh Indian engineers are on H-1B visas in US, say industry estimates. 4. In 2016, till August, Indian workers had got 72 per cent of total H-1B visas issued worldwide. 5. During the same period, Indian workers also received 30 per cent of all L1 visas. 6. The big advantages of L1 is that there there is no cap on the number to be issued every year. 7. According to the proposed order, firms would have to try to hire American first. If they recruit foreign workers, priority would be given to the most highly paid. 8. The move, if it goes through, could change the way US tech giants like Microsoft , Amazon and Apple hire talent. 9. It would also force wholesale changes at Indian companies such as Infosys and Wipro . 10. A bill in the US House of Representatives calls for the minimum salary for an H-1B visa to be doubled, to around $130,000 per annum from the present $60,000.

He said the Narmada Express-way will begin from Amarkantak and connect the state with Chhattisgarh and Gujarat. Similarly, the Chambal Express-way will connect Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Admitting lapses on the part of contractors during development of highways, the union minister claimed that new roads were being constructed according to international standards and these roads will not develop potholes for next 200-years. 'I am ashamed of lapses and delays in the development projects but I assure that the roads being constructed these days will not get damaged or develop potholes for next 200-years,' said the minister?. He further informed that the transport department was not only concentrating on road construction work but also focusing on developing 20,000-km of inland waterways in the country. 'In Madhya Pradesh, the waterways will be developed on Chambal, Narmada and Tonk rivers,' he said.

No exemption on toll tax Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday denied exemption of toll fee to the public. Replying to a query on waiving toll fee Gadkari said, 'Toll fee will not be waived anywhere for anybody. Even journalists will have to pay. If we want good quality work they we will have to pay for it,' he reiterated. On facilities given to MPs and MLAs, whether they will have to pay the toll, the union minister maintained that there is no proposal to impose tool fee on lawmakers.

NEW DELHI: Low cost carrier IndiGo reported a net profit of Rs 487.2 crore in the quarter ended December 2016, down 25percent from Rs 650.3 crore in same period previous fiscal.

The scrip of InterGlobe Aviation, IndiGo's parent company, closed at Rs 900.85, down 3.4percent on BSE on Tuesday. IndiGo president Aditya Ghosh said: 'We have reported yet another profitable quarter despite lower yields and higher fuel prices.

The December quarter saw the budget airline's overall expenses rise to Rs 4,556.3 crore from Rs 3,495.8 crore in the same period a year ago. This was fuelled primarily by the ATF costs rising 40percent to Rs 1,671.2 crore in Q3 from Rs 1,165.9 crore in Q3, FY-16. The airline, which currently has 126 aircraft, expects to add six more by the end of this fiscal. It will add cities like Doha, Sharjah, Dhaka, Amritsar, Mangalore and Madurai to its network. The airline admitted its 'operational performance (was) impacted during the quarter primarily due to challenges faced by adverse weather conditions, ATC congestion at key airports and A320neo issues ... Implemented several measures to improve performance; expect to get back to our historical performance' It also said engine problems on the Airbus A-320 new engine option (Neo) continue. '(We) continue to face some issues with neo engines. Receiving necessary operational and technical support from Airbus and Pratt  and  Whitney,' the airline said.

MUMBAI: Kansai Nerolac Paints Limited (KNPL), a leading paint company in India , reported a 44percent rise in net profit at Rs 124 crore in the third quarter ended December 31, 2016, while gross sales grew by about 6percent to Rs 1,246 crore.

H M Bharuka , managing director, Kansai Nerolac Paints , said, 'The company has registered close to double digit volume growth in decorative  and  industrial. In decorative the effect of demonetization was more pronounced in the rural markets. In case of industrial, in the two-wheelers, and three wheeler auto segments as well as in the general industrial market, the effect of demonetization was seen sharply. The industry has observed a sharp rise in prices of key raw materials as well as volatility in the exchange rates. Going forward company expects demand to revive. Continuously hardening raw material costs are expected to put pressure on the bottom-line.' In its outlook on the Indian paint industry , the company said a good growth in infrastructure, core sector as well as automobile and real estate is likely to have a positive effect on the overall demand of paint.

The fast-food chain had opened 73 restaurants in Russia last year, exceeding its forecast. Of the newly-opened restaurants, 65 are company-owned. Reuters | Updated: Jan 31, 2017, 06.18 PM IST McDonald's plans to open more than 50 restaurants in Russia this year and hopes to sign more franchising deals to expand in existing and new regions, the local unit's chief executive said on Tuesday. The fast-food chain opened 73 restaurants in Russia last year, exceeding its forecast. Of the newly-opened restaurants, 65 are company-owned, Khamzat Khasbulatov , head of McDonald's Russia , told a news conference. Khasbulatov said the target for new outlets in 2017 did not signify the company was slowing the pace of its expansion. '(The situation) has not got better or worse, 50 is not a small number, we are just giving more freedom to our partners and time to gather pace,' said Khasbulatov. McDonalds currently has three franchisees in Russia, two of which have been opening its outlets in the Urals and Siberia. Franchisees operate 92 restaurants out of its total of 609. 'The (franchising) program will develop, we are looking for new partners,' Khasbulatov said. He added the company aimed to bring the share of local suppliers to almost 100 percent by the end of 2018 from the current 85 percent and was encouraging suppliers to develop production in Russia - a move likely to shield it from currency swings and any import restrictions. In 2014 Russia banned many food imports in retaliation to Western sanctions over Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis. The food embargo, which is still in place, has driven up prices and gave a boost to the Russian agriculture industry.

Read More MUMBAI: Baba Ramdev's Patanjali is fighting the foreign FMCGs by adopting a very cost effective media strategy that focuses on using news channels to advertise, using Baba Ramdev's personal credibility, and by highlighting the natural positioning of its products. Notwithstanding the free publicity that Ramdev gets on various TV channels, in 2016 alone, Patanjali Ayurved inserted as many as 1.14 million advertisements across television channels, as per data from viewership measurement agency BARC India . Consider this: Patanjali advertisements were displayed on TV channels for 7,221 hours across 161 channels. That translates into an average of 19 hours 43 minutes of advertising time every day. Interestingly, Patanjali is the fastest growing FMCG company in India. Within two years of its scale up, it has already crossed revenues of Rs 5,000 crore and the company claims it will end the current fiscal with revenues upwards of Rs 10,000 crore. It’s not only a high voltage media campaign, but media experts credit Patanjali’s success to its marketing strategy as well. “They have a very bold strategy. By its nature, FMCG is not an easy business and requires massive brand building as well as wide distribution. Its distribution is better than what most people thought, and the promoter himself is the biggest brand ambassador, with a huge following,” said Ashish Bhasin, chairman and CEO South Asia at Dentsu Aegis Network. Experts said that Patanjali has got two insights right, which has helped the brand scale up fast. “First, is the general tendency among the Indian people to go towards natural/herbal products with heritage and Baba Ramdev epitomises that trend. Second, is the rise of nationalistic pride and patriotism, which has definitely helped Patanjali. It is the perfect brand fit,” Bhasin explained. But Patranjali Ayurved thinks about media differently. “We don’t just advertise, we run informative campaigns,” said SK Tijarawala, spokesperson for Patanjali Ayurved. Patanjali's spends on advertising was just 8-10percent compared to what FMCG majors spend normally. “We work on three basic principles set by Swami ji (Ramdev) -- world class quality, lowest price, and that all profits are to be given away to charity. Even in our campaigns, we don’t spend money on celebrities. Swamiji talks to consumers directly. Our entire advertising and marketing spend is around a mere Rs 300 crore,” Tijarawala said. So how does Patanjali get so much bang for the buck? Interestingly, 84percent of total advertisements that Patanjali aired in 2016 played on news channels, a strategy which media planners say has helped Baba create brand pull amongst traders and viewers alike. Basabdatta Chowdhury, national COO at Publicis Groupe-owned media buying firm Starcom India, pointed out that Patanjali has entered into the top 10 advertisers on TV, which is a big statement, considering that it was a non-existing brand a couple of years back. She added that targeting news genre has helped the company. “It was a very smart move to go for news genre, which otherwise had insignificant FMCG presence. Today, Patanjali has over 70percent presence in the news genre in the category. They couldn’t have achieved the same in the Hindi general entertainment or movie categories.” Anand Chakravarthy, managing partner at Maxus India, said that by advertising heavily on news channels, which is viewed by many traders, it is creating trade confidence. “Baba Ramdev also has massive following and he elicits credibility. It’s a situation where consumers are asking for the products, and retailers are in turn reaching out to stockists and distributors. It's a pull strategy versus push strategy that many FMCG majors follow.” According to a recent survey by Edelweiss Securities, natural positioning and attractive pricing have helped Patanjali wrest market share from players such as Dabur, Colgate and HUL. According to the survey, 83percent users prefer Patanjali products due to their natural positioning, while 38percent because of attractive pricing. AS many as 91percent respondents find natural products better and 67percent are ready to pay a premium for them, indicating that natural and, especially affordable naturals, should remain the key focus area for consumer goods companies to prevent market share loss and achieve better growth. Though Patanjali has gained largely in honey, ghee and toothpaste up until now, other players in shampoo, biscuits and soaps fear the risk of losing market share to the yoga guru.

The 30-share index closed 193.60 points down at 27,655.96 while the 50-share index broke below the 8,600 level after shedding 71.45 points to settle at 8561.30. 2017-01-31T16:41+00:00 Related Videos Sensex plunges 194 pts, Nifty5... MUMBAI: There were signs of anxiety in the market as the Sensex on Tuesday slumped 194 points ahead of the budget — to be presented on Wednesday — to a one-week low of 27,656 and the Nifty slipped below 8,600 after the Economic Survey projected a lower growth of 6.5 per cent for 2016-17. The recently introduced immigration restrictions by US President Donald trump and the new legislation that aims to rework the H1-B visa programme dealt a blow to IT stocks, which saw a big fall. TCS, Wipro and Infosys dropped by up to 4.47 per cent, dragging down the BSE IT index by 2.96 per cent, followed by technology that tanked 2.49 per cent. The Economic Survey for 2016-17, tabled in Parliament by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today, underscored the need for more reforms. Its GDP growth forecast for this fiscal is lower than the 7.1 per cent put out by the Central Statistics Office earlier this month. The Sensex closed down 193.60 points, or 0.70 per cent, at 27,655.96, its lowest closing since January 24 when the figure was 27,375.58. It had lost 33 points in the previous session. The broad-based NSE Nifty, which hit a low of 8,552.40 intra-day, managed to cut down losses and ended lower 71.45 points, or 0.83 per cent, at 8,561.30. The risk-averse behaviour was on display as participants took cues from global stocks that remained on the backfoot following Trump's controversial crackdown on immigration. 'The Economic Survey failed to impress investors who opted for keeping their commitments at a low ebb and wait for the the budget,' said Manoj Choraria, a Delhi-based stock broker. GAIL, Adani Ports, Sun Pharma, Tata Motors, Coal India, Lupin, Axis Bank and NTPC were among those that weighed. Sectoral indices such as oil and gas (1.64 per cent), PSU (1.39 per cent), healthcare (1.38 per cent), infrastructure (1.31) per cent and metal (1.01 per cent) all turned weak. Selling activity also extended to the broader markers, with the BSE midcap falling 1.10 per cent and the smallcap 1.03 per cent. According to provisional figures, foreign investors bought shares worth Rs 607.36 crore yesterday. There were a few that went up cushioning the fall, which include ITC , PowerGrid , Bajaj Auto , ONGC and HDFC Bank. In Asia, most markets were closed today for a public holiday. Japan's Nikkei ended lower by 1.69 per cent. European markets, however, were trading higher as major indices in France, Germany and the UK moved up.

Currently, only purchases above Rs 2 lakh require know-your-customer-compliance in the gold market. Chartered accountant Bhargav Vaidya, who provides consultancy services to the gems and jewellery sector, and the secretary of one of the country’s largest bullion association, expects the KYC requirements for bullion and jewellery to be revised lower from the present Rs 2 lakh in Budget FY18, to be presented on Wednesday. “I think the KYC (compliance) will be cut to Rs 50,000 from Rs 2 lakh at present in the Budget for FY18,” said Vaidya, proprietor of BN Vaidya  and  Associates. Apart from the trade, financial regulators take feedback while drafting policy for gold trade from Vaidya. Any such move would come amid the government’s crackdown against black money hoarders. Post demonetisation , entities holding unaccounted wealth in the form of scrapped Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes converted these largely into jewellery, bullion and real estate. If Vaidya’s hunch proves right, customers buying gold, silver or bars of either metal would need to quote their PAN or Aadhaar number, or even provide Kisan Credit Card in rural areas, for purchases over Rs 50,000. Going by Monday’s intraday gold rate of Rs 28,674 per 10 gm that amount buys just 17 gm of gold. Jewellers, preferring anonymity, feel the government’s measure could be prompted by certain constituents in the trade giving it a bad name by selling gold and in lesser cases silver in exchange for old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes post demonetisation. Regulatory agencies like income-tax, Enforcement Directorate and the department of revenue intelligence have been busy surveying bullion dealers and jewellers across the country to figure out how huge sales took place on and immediately after the demonetisation announcement. “My guess is KYC requirement would be revised for purchases above .`1lakh in the upcoming Budget,” said Surendra Mehta, national secretary of India Bullion  and  Jewellers Association (IBJA). These people will decide how much money you will save in this Budget 17 Arun Jaitley's lieutenants In a year that's likely to see many changes in both the budget and its process, finance minister Arun Jaitley has a well-settled team, one that has been on the job for a while. The squad, though, has the unenviable task of delivering a budget that's the most anticipated in recent years, with expectations running high post demonetisation. ASHOK LAVASA, Finance Secretary Lavasa, a 1980-batch IAS officer of the Haryana cadre, spearheaded the streamlining of approvals at the environment ministry, which, under the previous government, was blamed for tardy clearances and corruption. Lavasa, an avid photographer who co-authored a book, An Uncivil Servant, has a tough task, with this budget likely boasting of many firsts. As finance secretary, he leads the budget-making exercise and has to strike a balance between the expectations of ministries and departments seeking larger allocations and the fiscal deficit goals of the government. SHAKTIKANTA DAS, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs If there is one bureaucrat who knows the budget better than anyone, it is Das. He has seen it right from the time he was joint secretary budget and has also run the machine from the top for a few years. Das has to deliver a glitch-free budget and pack it with enough reforms to meet expectations. He needs to provide ideas to put the economy back on track post demonetisation and something extra so that the private sector starts to invest. HASMUKH ADHIA, Secretary, Department of Revenue Adhia faces the difficult task of de livering big tax collections through the disclosure scheme announced during demonetisation. A trusted aide of Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Gujarat, Adhia's key focus soon after coming to the revenue department from financial services was to reduce complaints against tax authorities. He has been able to move swiftly against the black sheep in the department and also take steps to reduce litigation. This budget will be keenly watched for path-breaking changes in direct taxes, starting with elimination of exemptions, reduction in the corporate tax rate and going on to implementation of the goods and services tax. NEERAJ KUMAR GUPTA, Secretary, Dept of Investment and Public Asset Mgmt Strategic asset sales are expected to be the top agenda given that there are approvals to dilute the government's stake in as many as six companies. This financial year, Gupta has managed to prevail on cash-rich companies to go for buybacks, which fetched the government Rs 15,982 crore, and the year could end with all-time high disinvestment receipts. The government will seek to monetise stakes held through the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India and push for listing of profitable subsidiaries of state-run companies. Winding up of loss-making companies and selling their assets will also keep Gupta busy in 2017. ARVIND SUBRAMANIAN, Chief Economic Advisor The CEA hasn't figured prominently in the demonetisation process, but he could have a big impact on the budget. While he could not get the government to relax the fiscal goals last time, a bigger idea of his could find a place in the budget. The Economic Survey is likely to lay out the concept of universal basic income as a poverty allevia tion tool. Although the notion has its set of critics, it is likely that the finance minister may adopt it in some form. ANJULY CHIB DUGGAL, Secretary, Department of Financial Services Following demonetisation, the gov ernment will aggressively pursue its cashless drive, with state-run fi nancial institutions at the forefront. After having put the Banks Board Bureau in place, reforms in public sector banks will be high on the agenda. Bad loans plague the bank ing sector and the government may need to find additional resources to meet their capital needs and lessen their burden. The listing of state-run general insurers will keep Duggal busy. After the merger of State Bank of India with its subsidiaries, some action could be seen on the merger of public sector banks.

PTI | Updated: Jan 31, 2017, 04.37 PM IST Manmohan Singh and P Chidambaram during the release of the document. NEW DELHI: A day before presentation of Economic Survey , former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Monday painted a bleak picture of the Indian economy insisting 'it is not in good shape' while former Finance Minister P Chidambaram said the government is 'hiding behind' GDP numbers that are being challenged. Releasing the ' Real State of Economy 2017 ', a document prepared by the Congress research cell at the party headquarters here, Singh said it speaks about the state of India's economy, its many issues and where it is heading. 'That the Indian economy is not in a good state is obvious. Even IMF has downgraded our GDP growth and it will not be 7.6 per cent but less than 6.6 per cent,' he said. Chidambaram said the state of the economy 'is not something that we can be happy about' and expressed concern over the low credit growth which he claimed is at 5 per cent, the 'lowest in several decades'. 'BJP is hiding behind a GDP number which is being challenged. People are not dazzled by it, but are asking where are the jobs? 'NDA government tends to believe exaggerated version of economy, this research document is closer to truth than what government will say tomorrow,' he said. Chidambaram said every government must be optimistic, but optimism must stem from a realistic assessment of situation. 'Yet, if government presents tomorrow a rosy picture of the economy, people of India are entitled to question that. There are no jobs, capital formation is declining, credit growth is the lowest in several decades,' he said. Chidambaram wanted government to focus on fiscal consolidation and said, 'there are serious question marks on this government's ability to follow fiscal prudence'. He dismissed suggestions that the 2008 farm loan waiver was a populist measure, saying, 'It was based on the response to a demand from the farming community and was a very wise decision.' 'This was especially so as the international financial crisis hit in September 2008, which crippled even major economies but did not affect India much,' he said. He claimed that while there are no jobs, new capital investment and no credit growth, the document released 'candidly, truthfully' assesses the state of India's economy, supported by hard research and data. Hoping that government will not cut social sector spending, the former Finance Minister claimed that the MNREGS was the lone scheme that provided some succour to poor by way of jobs. 'There is a 60 per cent spurt in demand for MNREGS jobs. If they are cut, then it would be a very cruel cut. This demand is because of loss of jobs and. I sincerely hope that this government will not make this cardinal mistake of cutting expenditure,' he said. Congress spokesperson Rajiv Gowda said, 'The slowdown in the Indian economy in the wake of demonetisation will last four to five years.' He told the government that it should not use the issue of universal basic income tax an excuse to attack social safety net.

PTI | Updated: Jan 30, 2017, 10.20 PM IST Finance minister during launch of pilot services of India Post Payments Bank NEW DELHI: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday said payments bank will have a 'multiplier impact' by providing doorstep banking to people in remote areas at lower cost and compete with traditional banks in future. Launching the pilot services of India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) at Raipur and Ranchi, Jaitley said IPPB will expand operations to 650 districts by September and have a 'multiplier impact' on the country's banking system and financial inclusion. India Post , which got RBI nod to launch banking operations on January 20, is only the third entity to have got permit to start operations after Airtel Payments Bank and PayTm. 'The pattern in which the payments bank is being formed, the overhead cost is very less because the existing structure is being used. Going forward, a time will come when for small depositors this payments bank will give competition to normal banking,' Jaitley said. He said telecom companies have lakhs of stores which will start working as payments banks. Also with 1.55 lakh post office branches and the services of lakhs of postmen being converted into banking operation with the launch of India Post Payments Bank, the demand for a brick and mortar bank branches in far flung villages will get reduced. Payments banks can accept deposits of up to Rs 1 lakh per account from individuals and small businesses. The new model of banking allows mobile firms, supermarket chains and others to cater to banking requirements of individuals and small businesses. It will be set up as a differentiated bank and will confine its activities to acceptance of demand deposits, remittance services, Internet banking and other specified services. India Post Payments Bank will ensure doorstep banking and by September as all post office branches get converted into banks, the banking system of the country will gain a lot of strength, Jaitley said.

PTI | Updated: Jan 31, 2017, 01.09 PM IST MUMBAI: The benchmark Sensex dropped over 98 points and the NSE Nifty slipped below the 8,600-mark in early session on Tuesday as participants kept their bets to a minimum tracking the Economic Survey due later in the day. Besides, weak global cues tempered mood. The 30-share index was down 98.02 points, or 0.35 per cent, at 27,751.54, with IT, auto, technology, metal and PSU trading in the negative zone, falling by up to 0.92 per cent. The gauge had lost 32.90 points in the previous session. The 50-share NSE Nifty was trading lower by 36.75 points, or 0.43 per cent, at 8,596. Sentiment remained conspicuously cautious as investors preferred to reduce their positions ahead of the Economic Survey due today and the Union budget tomorrow. A subdued trend in Asia coupled with a decline on the Wall Street after President Donald Trump 's controversial crackdown on immigration and his plans to overhaul work-visa programmes dampened sentiment further here, traders added. In the Asian region, most markets are closed today for a public holiday. Japan's Nikkei was down 1.33 per cent in early deals. The US Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.61 per cent lower yesterday.

NEW DELHI: HDFC , the mortgage lender, on Monday reported a 12.80 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 2,728.66 crore for the third quarter ended December. Profit for October-December of 2015-16 stood at Rs 2,419 crore. The total income increased to Rs 14,981.41 crore from Rs 12,253.9 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal, HDFC said in a statement. On a standalone basis, HDFC reported a growth of 11.9 per cent in net profit at Rs 1,701.21 crore during the third quarter as against Rs 1,520.51 crore a year earlier. The standalone income climbed to Rs 8,137.18 crore for the said quarter, from Rs 7,268.44 crore earlier. The mortgage lender mainly finances loans for purchase or construction of residential houses, commercial real estate and certain other purposes. As on December 31, the loan book stood at Rs 2,86,876 crore. On assets under management (AUM) basis, the growth in the individual loan book was 17 per cent and that of non-individual 19 per cent. The asset quality of the lender came under strain during the quarter, with gross NPA rising to 0.81 per cent (Rs 2,341 crore in absolute terms) compared with 0.72 per cent in the year-ago period. The non-performing loans of the individual portfolio stood at 0.65 per cent while that of the non-individual portfolio read 1.16 per cent. 'As per the National Housing Bank norms, the corporation is required to carry a total provision of Rs 2,263 crore of which Rs 1,505 crore is against standard assets,' it said. The provision as on December 31, 2016 stood at Rs 3,198 crore, of which Rs 705 crore is on account of non-performing loans, it said, adding that this provision is equivalent to 1.11 per cent of the portfolio. For the nine months ended December, consolidated profit increased 18 per cent to Rs 7,972 crore as against Rs 6,730 crore in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal. The share of profit from subsidiary and associate companies in the consolidated profit after tax stood at 32 per cent for the nine months ended December 2016.

It said any merger would involve Idea issuing new shares to Vodafone and would result in Vodafone deconsolidating Vodafone India. AFP | Updated: Jan 30, 2017, 05.33 PM IST NEW DELHI: British mobile phone giant Vodafone said Monday that it was in talks to merge its Indian unit with Idea Cellular in a move that would create India's largest telecoms company. The confirmation ended months of speculation that the two operators were exploring a deal to help fend off Reliance Jio whose recent arrival shook up India's ultra-competitive mobile network market. It also sent Idea shares soaring by a whopping 26 percent on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). 'Vodafone confirms that it is in discussions with the Aditya Birla Group about an all share merger of Vodafone India (excluding Vodafone's 42percent stake in Indus Towers) and Idea,' Vodafone said in a statement. 'Any merger would be effected through the issue of new shares in Idea to Vodafone and would result in Vodafone de-consolidating Vodafone India. 'There is no certainty that any transaction will be agreed, nor as to the terms or timing of any transaction,' the statement added. A merger between Vodafone India and the Mumbai-based Idea Cellular would turn India's multi-billion dollar telecommunications market on its head, according to global brokerage firm CLSA. The group of analysts has estimated that the pair would command a combined revenue market share of 43 percent, ahead of rival Bharti Airtel, which would hold 33 percent. Reliance Jio, which began operations with great fanfare last year and is owned by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani would have 13 percent, according to CLSA's research. The 4G Jio network launched in September with an audacious free service for the rest of 2016, followed by vastly cheaper data plans and free voice calls for life. It forced rivals to dramatically slash their tariffs and left them scrambling to match the deep pockets of Jio, which is backed by India's hugely wealthy energy-to-chemicals conglomerate Reliance Industries. In afternoon trade Idea stocks were up 26.86 percent, or 20.90 points at 98.70 rupees on the BSE's Sensex index following the announcement. Vodafone was trading up three percent at 199.15 pence on the London Stock Exchange in early morning trade.

AFP | Updated: Jan 30, 2017, 09.52 AM IST NEW YORK: Starbucks plans to hire 10,000 refugees worldwide over the next five years in response to President Donald Trump 's travel ban, the head of the US coffee-chain company said on Sunday. 'I write to you today with deep concern, a heavy heart and a resolute promise,' Starbucks chairman and chief executive Howard Schultz said in a letter to employees posted on the company's website. 'We are living in an unprecedented time, one in which we are witness to the conscience of our country, and the promise of the American Dream, being called into question.' Schultz, a Democratic Party supporter, said that Starbucks had been in contact with employees affected by the new Republican president's executive order signed Friday. The decree suspends the arrival of all refugees for at least 120 days, Syrian refugees indefinitely and bars citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days. The CEO said the refugee hires would be fleeing war, persecution and discrimination in the 75 countries where the company operates. 'And we will start this effort here in the US by making the initial focus of our hiring efforts on those individuals who have served with US troops as interpreters and support personnel in the various countries where our military has asked for such support,' he said. Schultz also defended Mexico, which Trump has said will have to pay for a wall along its long and porous border with the United States to deter immigrants, perhaps by the US imposing a 20 percent tariff on Mexican imports. 'Building bridges, not walls, with Mexico,' he wrote, voicing support for the country that has provided Starbucks with coffee for three decades and where nearly 600 Starbucks coffee shops employ 7,000 people. 'We stand ready to help and support our Mexican customers, partners and their families as they navigate what impact proposed trade sanctions, immigration restrictions and taxes might have on their business and their trust of Americans. 'But we will continue to invest in this critically important market all the same.' Schultz is close to Hillary Clinton , the Democratic presidential candidate who lost to Trump in the November election, and supported her during her White House campaign. But he has dismissed persistent rumors that he would seek the highest office in the land. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

PTI | Updated: Jan 30, 2017, 09.31 AM IST MUMBAI: Japanese financial services major Nomura has downplayed the impact of the protectionist trade policies of the US President Donald Trump on the country as it sees only 10 bps hit on GDP at 6.8 per cent in 2017. It is also quick to add that Trumpnomics will hit the domestic software exporters, as 86 per cent of the H1B visas in the past have been cornered by Indians. 'We expect this hit on growth to be only transitory, as remonetisation, wealth re-distribution and lower lending rates should result in growth returning to above 7 per cent from the second half of 2017,' Nomura said in a weekend report. With the growth momentum hit hard by the notes ban, Nomura had earlier projected GDP growth to dip to 6.9 per cent in 2017 from 7.1 per cent in 2016, with a sharp slowdown in the first half of the current year. The agency said its 'downside risk scenario' is based on the assumptions of a large fiscal stimulus but greater inflation pressures forcing the Fed to hike its record low rates four times this year, quick implementation of medium- scale US trade protectionism, tighter immigration policies and some retaliation by way of exiting or renegotiating FTAs. Other risks also include imposing an across-the-board tariffs, or targeted tariffs on specific imports, or border taxes, incentives to US firms to repatriate their overseas profits, deportation of illegal immigrants and reducing the inflow of new ones, a noticeable rise in geopolitical tensions. Trumponomics refers to economic policies of te new US President and assumes a fiscal stimulus to boost growth from the third quarter, two Fed hikes this year, low-scale US trade protectionism and tighter immigration policies, among others. Noting that the country's vulnerability to Trumponomics is 'neutral' with restrictions on immigrations as the main concern, Nomura said it 'currently projects GDP growth to slow to 6.9 per cent in 2017 from 7.1 per cent in 2016, largely reflecting a weak first quarter owing to demonetisation, followed by a sharp V-shaped recovery in second half of 2017'. 'In our risk scenario, we would expect growth to slow only marginally to 6.8 per cent, mainly due to weaker trade volumes and tighter financial conditions,' it added. As per Nomura, Trump plans to raise H-1B minimum salaries, give preference to Americans over foreigners, limit green cards and scrap H-1B extensions, can hit the country. Besides, increased US trade protectionism will also hurt India, but more indirectly, as India is not a part of the now scrapped Trans-Pacific Partnership. 'The US accounts for about 15 per cent of the country's goods exports, which is a paltry 2 per cent of US imports. A border tax or an across-the-board tariff increase could hurt the country's major exports to the US such as pharma, textiles, gem  and  jewellery and auto products. However, Nomura noted that geopolitically, India stands to benefit as Trump seems to believe that a nuclear India is the real check to Pakistan.

PTI | Updated: Jan 30, 2017, 10.43 AM IST MUMBAI: The rupee gave up 5 paise to trade 68.08 against the US dollar in early session on Monday, snapping its 3-day winning run, owing to month-end demand for the American currency from importers amid a lower opening in the stock market. Forex dealers said increased demand for the US currency from importers put a squeeze on the rupee, but dollar's weakness against other currencies overseas capped the fall. The rupee had firmed up by 4 paise to close at 68.03 against the US dollar on Friday amid modest dollar selling by banks and exporters. Meanwhile, the benchmark BSE Sensex fell 34.71 points, or 0.12 per cent, to 27,847.75 in early trading today.

NEW DELHI: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley may hike service tax rate to 16-18 per cent from the current 15 per cent in the Budget , due on Wednesday, as a precursor to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rollout. The move, that will make flying, eating out, phone bills and a host of other services expensive, would be an attempt to take the rates closer to the proposed tax slabs for GST. GST, which will subsume central and state levies like excise duty, service tax and VAT, is scheduled to be rolled out from July 1. The tax slabs decided for the GST are 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent and taking service tax closer to one of the slabs is a logical move in the Budget, tax experts said. Tax experts say, Jaitley, who had in his previous budget hiked service tax rate by 0.5 per cent to 15 per cent, may raise the levy by at least one percentage point to 16 per cent. Some others feel there could be different service tax rates with a lower 12 per cent for basic services and a higher 18 per cent for the rest. Also, a higher service tax for April-June will help the government garner more revenue to meet expenses on schemes and programmes it may be planning to contain the impact of demonetisation. A service tax rate closer to the GST rate will also help consumers avoid a greater price shock when the new national sales tax is rolled out. While service tax until now is a central levy, it will be equally split between the Centre and states under the new GST regime. Most services, except essential ones like primary healthcare and basic education, will be covered by GST. Service tax was budgeted to provide Rs 2.31 lakh crore in 2016-17, more than 14 per cent of the Centre's total tax revenues of Rs 16.30 lakh crore. This will be the third time that Jaitley will raise service tax rate. Service tax from June 1, 2015 was hiked from 12.36 per cent to 14 per cent. A 0.5 per cent Swachh Bharat Cess was levied on all services, taking the total incidence of service tax to 14.5 per cent from November 15, 2015. In the last Budget, he imposed a Krishi Kalyan Cess at the rate of 0.5 per cent on all taxable services to take the levy to 15 per cent.

Maxis Communication Berhad (MCB) and Krishnan were chargesheeted along with former telecom minister Dayanidhi Maran in the Aircel-Maxis deal. Maran was alleged to have arm-twisted and forced Aircel owner C Sivasankaran to sell his majority stake to the Maxis group owned by the Malaysian billionaire. Immediately after Maxis secured majority stake in Aircel, it was granted 2G licence in Novem- ber 2006. Although Aircel admits that Maxis holds 73.99percent stake in it, the company has told SC that it has 'no control' over the Malaysian firm and contended that Krishnan had no direct interest in Maxis and is 'only having a deemed indirect interest'. It pleaded to the court that no adverse order should be passed against the company as it was itself not made an accused in the scam. The Malaysian company and its promoter had refused to subject themselves to court proceedings against them and refused to respond to repeated summons issued against them by the trial court ,which had last year issued arrest warrants against Krishnan. Taking strong exception to Maxis group and Krishnan's non-appearance, the apex court had, on January 6, asked the Centre to frame modalities for transfer of spectrum from Aircel to another telecom operator if the accused failed to submit themselves to the Indian courts. 'He (Krishnan) must come to India and present himself before the court if he is using the national assets (2G spectrum). We will not tolerate him enjoying the assets of the nation and run away from the law of the country...We want to secure his presence before us. We want to give him full opportunity to present his side,' the court had said. Sensing that the court may pass order affecting its telecom operation, the company rushed to the court and said, 'The applicants cannot possibly exercise any control over the accused persons or the entities directed to appear before this court.' It has blamed CBI for not serving the summons successfully to Maxis as per the law due to which the company failed to respond to trial court's order. It also refuted the allegation that the company was trying to wind up its operations in the country and was selling its assets to other telecom companies. It said some part of the spectrum was transferred to Bharti Airtel to raise money for reduction of debts owed to banks and its proposed transaction with Reliance Communications was for acquiring assets and not for selling. 'The wireless assets of Reliance will be acquired by it in return for issue of equity shares of Aircel to Reliance. This will result in a combination of the wireless business of the two entities. No cash is involved in the proposed transaction so the question of taking out money does not arise,' the application said. 'A misleading impression appears to have been created that there is an attempt to liquidate its assets and move funds from India. The correct position is precisely the contrary,' it said. The company said it had made a huge investment of Rs 32,000 crore since 2006, but had yet to profit out of its business. It said the company owes debts of over Rs 17,300 crore to banks and if its operations were closed, it would be unable to repay the debt. 'The smooth operations of the company is imperative in the interest of, among others, consortium of banks, financiers, service suppliers, vendors, retailers and employees,' it said.

'The Indian metals industry passed through a period of turbulence in 2015 and 2016. PTI | Updated: Jan 30, 2017, 09.26 AM IST (Representative photo) MUMBAI: Growth in internal demand, implementation of government schemes and new measures will play a vital role in reviving the domestic metals industry in 2017, a report said. 'The Indian metals industry passed through a period of turbulence in 2015 and 2016. However, the government's recent measures to curb imports and introduction of price floor on select existing imports will play a major role in enabling the revival of the domestic metals industry,' Dun  and  Bradstreet (D and B) said in its report on 'Metals and Mining sectoral outlook 2017' said. The metals and mining industry predominantly derives its demand from growth of sectors such as infrastructure, construction, automobile, power and electronics, etc. The most significant growth opportunity going forward is expected to come from government schemes such as 'Make in India', 'Smart Cities' program, 100 per cent rural electrification and 'Housing for All', it said. The report pointed out that the low cost imports have adversely impacted the domestic steel industry. In 2016, the world steel production remained flat as compared to the previous year. All the major steel producing countries in the world have registered a decline or significant reduction in production, with India being the only exception. For the period January-October 2016, crude steel production in India increased to 79.2 million tonnes, registering a growth of 6 per cent, as compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. However, the unfavourable market for steel globally has negatively impacted the Indian steel industry too. The implementation of the Minimum Import Price (MIP) on select steel imports played a vital role in protecting the domestic players, the report added. The oversupply of steel in India will deeply hinder the ability of domestic manufacturers to increase prices, thereby likely impacting their growth during 2017. The government's strong focus on increasing manufacturing in India through its 'Make in India' campaign and expected increase in infrastructure spending for roads, rail and ports are expected to boost demand for steel in India, D and B report said.

Goswami, believed to be married to former Bollywood actor Mamta Kulkarni , was arrested in Mombassa in 2014 following a sting operation by Kenyan cops and the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). He was released on bail on the condition that he would stay in the country until a local court de cided on an extradition request by the US. The others extradited by the Kenyan authorities on Tuesday are locals Ibrahim and Baktash Akasha, sons of a slain drug baron, and Gulam Hussein, a Pakistani national. The men are accused of conspiring to import pure 'white crystal' heroin into the US at a knock-down price of around $10,000 (Rs 6.75 lakh) a kg. Goswami, son of a police officer from Gujarat, started out as a bootlegger in the 1980s. After graduating to smuggling mandrax, he fled to Mumbai while on bail after being arrested in a drug bust. Over the last two decades, he expanded his network to Dubai and Africa. In India, he was recently linked to the massive seizure of raw materials for methamphetamine from a Solapur pharma unit.

Read More NEW DELHI: In his bid to rally around the NDA flock ahead of Budget presentation, PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday urged all allies to speak in one voice outside and inside Parliament. Modi's remarks at a meeting of alliance partners are significant as Shiv Sena has been at odds with the government over several issues and stayed away from an all-party meeting convened by the government on Monday. Relations have deteriorated after Sena and BJP failed to reach an agreement to contest the Mumbai civic polls together, leading to some bitter exchanges. 'Everyone should speak in one voice and NDA must remain one,' Modi told the meeting. He said the opposition had no issue against the government and an unified NDA would help convey a positive message. The stress on unity is also significant considering the opposition's success in ensuring a washout of the winter session where Congress and a vocal Trinamool stalled proceedings. Trinamool is seen as likely to persist with its tactics. Though the PM did not refer to the forthcoming state elections, it seemed obvious that he felt the Budget should not be marred by signs of disunity in the public domain. He said the President's address to the joint session of Parliament listed achievements of the government and all members should build on that. Defending the decision to advance presentation of the Budget, Modi said, 'advancing the Budget date will facilitate execution of more development work'.

Scientists from the US and India, after a joint investigation, have concluded that consuming litchi triggers the illness and death. | TNN | Feb 1, 2017, 05.30 AM IST Consuming litchi in an empty stomach has been blamed for neurological illness in children Bihar's Muzaffarpur. NEW DELHI: The mystery behind the outbreak of an unexplained neurological illness in Bihar's Muzaffarpur, which had claimed nearly 100 lives each year till 2014, has been solved. Scientists from the US and India, after a joint investigation, have concluded that consuming litchi --a tropical fruit Muzaffarpur is famous for- on an empty stomach triggers the illness and death. Seasonal outbreak of the mysterious illness, characterised by acute seizures and changed mental status, has been plaguing Muzaffarpur for nearly two decades. Some similar cases have been reported from Malda in West Bengal. According to researchers, skipping an evening meal results in night-time hypoglycaemia, or low-blood sugar, particularly in children with limited reserve of glycogen -glucose stored in liver and muscles. This triggers oxidation of fatty acids for energy production and generation of glucose. However, naturally-occurring toxins that are found in litchis --hypoglycin A and methylenecyclopropylglycine (MPCG) - disrupt the fatty acid metabolism, leading to acutely low levels of blood sugar. This further affects brain function, leading to acute seizures and stroke. The reserach findings have been published in the latest issue of medical journal The Lancet . For years, many theories were proposed for the seasonal outbreak, including the possibility of pesticide exposure and infectious encephalitis, but no one could confirm anything. In 2013, the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in India and US Center for Disease Control initiated a joint investigation into the matter. The hospital-based surveillance involved laboratory investigations to assess potential infectious and non-infectious causes in 390 children less than 15 years old, who were admitted to Shri Krishna Medical College hospital and Krishnadevi Deviprasad Kejriwal maternity hospital -the chief referral medical centres in Muzaffarpur with sudden neurological illness. Of them, 122 (31percent) died. On admission, 204 (62percent) had lowblood glucose level. Most of them had consumed litchis and parents said they had missed the evening meal the previous day . Parents in affected villages reported that during May and June, children frequently spent their day eating litchis in orchards and many of them returned home in the evening and did not have a meal. 'This study, to the best of our knowledge, is the largest investigation of the Muzaffarpur outbreak and the first comprehensive confirmation that this recurring outbreak illness is associated with litchi consumption and toxicity from both hypoglycin A and MPCG. We confirm the presence of MPCG and hypoglycin in litchis, and, for the first time, our data shows the metabolites of these toxins in human biological specimens, the biological impact of these toxins on human metabolism, and the modifying effect of the lack of an evening meal of the impact of these toxins,' scientists report in the Lancet study.

The conviction came eight years after the Enforcement Directorate initiated an investigation against the minister (in 2009). Rai was held guilty of money laundering to the tune of Rs 3.72 crore and was given the maximum punishment under PMLA. The court observed that in case the former minister failed to deposit Rs 5 lakh in fine, the sentence of seven years will be extended by 18 months. Rai was a minister in the cabinets of chief ministers Arjun Munda, Madhu Koda and Shibu Soren between 2005 and 2008 and held various portfolios including tourism, urban development and forest and environment. This is the first instance where the ED, the nodal agency to prosecute people charged with money laundering under PMLA, has been successful in getting a conviction order. The agency is probing several other high-profile politicians under PMLA, including a few former Union ministers and chief ministers. Rai was first chargesheeted by the Jharkhand vigilance bureau and later by the CBI, holding him guilty of acquiring disproportionate assets. The ED initiated an investigation under PMLA against Rai and other associates in September 2009. The probe found that Rai, as minister in the Jharkhand government, misappropriated public money and laundered it through purchase and acquisition of various immovable and movable assets in the name of his wife and other associates. He ran a construction company, Mahamaya Construction Pvt Ltd, in his wife Sushila Devi's name. Another firm, Maa Gauri Construction, was managed by his brother Sanjay Kumar Rai. Other ventures were launched in the names of his wife and brother. Rai was held guilty under Section 3 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act and the court allowed confiscation of his properties.

Read More NEW DELHI: It wasn't India's coercive diplomacy or surgical strike, but the threat of international sanctions by the US under the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) that prompted action by Pakistan against Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) founder Hafiz Saeed . Monday's action may put Saeed out of sight for a few months, but there is no sign that his terror activities against India would be affected. FATF, an inter-governmental body, goes for effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering, terrorist financing and other related threats. In early January, when the Obama administration was still in office, Pakistan's ambassador in Washington Jalil Jilani was told by a senior US official that they would put Pakistan on the FATF's blacklist if Islamabad did not take action against LeT and JuD, and their funding mechanisms. JuD had come under the FATF's scanner for its financial transactions. Pakistan could declare JuD a banned or 'defunct' organisation, which means it could rebadge itself and function under another name. The strictures did not only come from the US, these were raised at the meeting of the Asia-Pacific Group (APG) on money laundering, which is part of the FATF. JuD, which is allowed to function without check in Pakistan despite coming under a ban by the UNSC's 1267 committee, has grown beyond being just a terror group targeting India, although India remains its principal target. It is now working with the Haqqani network and other terror entities in Afghanistan and parts of West Asia. Jilani reportedly forwarded the US message to Islamabad — Pakistan was given until January 31 to act against Saeed and JuD. This explains Saeed's house arrest a day before the deadline. The fact that Saeed was allowed to air a video reiterating his resolve to continue terror against India stands testimony to the fact that Pakistan does not want his arrest to be seen in the Indian context. In fact, since January 14, Saeed has already been moving some of the India-targeted operations of JuD to a new organisation, Tehreek-e-Azaad-e-Kashmir. The Sharif government decided to put JuD and Falahe-Insaniat Foundation (FIF), another Saeed organisation, into a watch list and approved freezing of their assets, cancelling passports and arms licences under UN resolution 1267. According to Pakistani media reports, the government has issued instructions to all departments concerned, including the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), commercial banks, law enforcement agencies at the federal level, including FBR and FIA, as well as provincial governments, to implement all these orders with immediate effect. If Pakistan is seen to be in violation of FATF rules, it would go right back into the blacklist, from which it only emerged in 2015.

(AFP photo) NEW DELHI: Though India's reaction to the detention of LeT chief Hafiz Saeed is a cautious 'wait and watch', the security establishment sees the move as a positive development that can, if sustained, improve ties with Pakistan. The detention and a likely decision to place Jamaat-ud-Dawa — the 'charitable' cover for LeT — and Falah-e-Insaniat on a watch list are being seen as steps in the right direction. 'Even though Hafiz Saeed and others are linking the crackdown to pressure on account of Donald Trump becoming US President, there are doubts about the new US administration attaching top priority to such actions at this early juncture,' said a top intelligence official. 'The preventive arrest of five top JuD/Falah-e-Insaniat leaders and the impending ban on the two outfits are, in all likelihood, conscious moves initiated by (Pakistan PM Nawaz) Sharif himself. We need to watch the military leadership's reaction as well as track any backlash from Lashkar, which works in league with the ISI. In this case, retaliatory strikes, if any, may take place within Pakistan rather than in India,' the official said. Though Pakistan is keen to signal to the Trump administration that it will act against terror outfits and masterminds based on its soil, the latest crackdown comes on the back of small hints of a thaw in Islamabad's attitude after a change of guard at the Pakistan army headquarters and the ISI, with the exit of former army chief General Raheel Sharif. Though Pakistan has denied the surgical strikes India pulled off in POK last year, New Delhi's insistence on outcomes on terrorism has become plain to Islamabad. The assessment, an intelligence officer pointed out, is that, helped by a more accommodative military leadership, Sharif can look to rescue the troubled ties with India. For instance, there has been no major terror attack by Pakistan-based outfits for over a month now. The recent release of Indian fishermen and the return of a soldier who crossed the LoC during the surgical strikes are encouraging signs, though security officials are watching events closely. Interestingly, while action has been initiated against JuD, the other major source of terror in India, Jaish-e Mohammad, led by Masood Azhar, is still off the hook. 'JuD/LeT has come under US scanner far more than Jaish. It is possible that Pakistan wants to take one step at a time. Only after the military leadership throws its weight behind the Sharif government will the latter move against Jaish,' said an expert. Of course, Saeed's detention falls way short of India's consistent demand that he be brought to justice for 26/11 and many recent terror attacks. 'Still, any action against him and JuD is welcome,' said a former intelligence official. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

This information has already been submitted to DGCA (Directorate General of Civil Aviation) and therefore it is required that this is investigated at the earliest ... a committee of flight safety department officials is hereby constituted at Delhi to carry out investigation into the subject and submit report as soon as possible,' says an order issued by Harpreet A De Sing, AI chief of flight safety department, on Monday. The action came after the Indian Commercial Pilots' Association (ICPA, union of erstwhile Indian Airlines' pilots) had sought a probe by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) into this allegation. 'It has been brought to our notice that one of the executive director who's a pilot has been evading pre-flight medical (PFM), endangering safety of innocent flying passengers and crew members .... Kindly investigate this gross violation by procuring the PFM record and all CTV footages in despatch and PFM room at Delhi for the fortnight and take necessary action as deemed fit... Action has been taken against pilot who had genuinely forgotten to do post flight breath analyser test and more stringent action should be taken against the individual for trying to cover up,' Captain T Praveen Keerthi, ICPA general secretary wrote to DGCA chief B S Bhullar on Monday.

PTI | Jan 31, 2017, 08.58 PM IST MUMBAI: A court on Tuesday issued a non- bailable warrant against beleaguered businessman Vijay Mallya in the IDBI Bank loan default case as the CBI sought his extradition from the UK. 'The court issued a non-bailable warrant (NBW) against Mallya after we filed an affidavit seeking his extradition from the UK,' said a CBI official, adding the warrant will be sent to that country through diplomatic channels. Special judge for CBI cases H S Mahajan issued the NBW after the agency's affidavit provided Mallya's precise address in the UK. 'Earlier too, a non-bailable warrant was issued against him but then we did not know his location,' the official said. On January 24, CBI filed a chargesheet in IDBI loan default case against nine people arrested a day earlier: former chairman of IDBI Bank Yogesh Aggarwal, former CFO of the Kingfisher Airlines (KFA) A Raghunathan, IDBI executives O V Bundellu, S K V Srinivasan, R S Sridhar, B K Batra and Kingfisher executives Shailesh Borke, A C Shah and Amit Nadkarni. It left out Mallya, as he is yet to be arrested. CBI said undue favours were shown to KFA in the sanctioning and disbursal of loans of Rs 1,300 crore and there were many acts of omission and commission on the part of IDBI Bank officials in the process. About Rs 260 crore of the borrowed amount was diverted by KFA, while Rs 263 crore were used to pay salaries, TDS, income tax and loan instalments. A part of the loan amount was also diverted by Mallya for his 'personal expenses', the CBI charge sheet said. The court also heard the arguments on bail applications of the accused, all of whom are now in judicial custody. The hearing would continue on February 3.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to stay the Tamil Nadu government's law permitting jallikattu+ , but agreed to hear a plea against it. A bench of Justices Dipak Misra and R F Nariman allowed the Centre to withdraw last year's notification allowing jallikattu+ . The court issued a notice to Tamil Nadu on the validity of the new state law, and gave the state government six weeks to reply to it. It also slammed the Tamil Nadu government for allowing people to defy its order on jallikattu, and for failing to maintain law and order in the state. The Supreme court had banned the controversial sport in 2014, on the grounds that it was cruel to bulls. 'What was the need for the situation? Why does this situation crop up? There was a situation which needed to be controlled. Please tell your executive that maintaining law and order situation is its prime duty. You please convey this,' the bench told the advocates appearing for Tamil Nadu. Last Wednesday, animal activists moved the Supreme Court challenging the validity of the Bill passed by the Tamil Nadu Assembly+ , and asked that it be quashed. The plea was filed by the Animal Welfare Board, and other activists sympathetic to its views. They said the law was illegal and unconstitutional. Tamil Nadu legislators passed the Bill on January 23, after the state witnessed pro-jallikattu protests on an unprecedented scale. The protests took a violent turn last Monday, after police in Chennai started evicting protesters at Marina Beach - the epicentre of this year's pro-jallikattu povement.

Our response to the preventive detention of Hafiz Saeed and others in Pakistan pic.twitter.com/hhGJXFfyc1 — Vikas Swarup (@MEAIndia) January 31, 2017 Hafiz Saeed is the chief of the Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD). The outfit is a front organization for the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba , of which Saeed was one of the founders. He was placed under detention along with four others on Monday night, under an anti-terrorism act. The move came just days after US President Donald Trump on Friday issued a controversial executive order temporarily halting travel from seven Muslim-majority countries+ - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Yemen, Syria and Somalia. On Sunday, a top White House official said there's a possibility of including Pakistan in the list. A Pakistani defence ministry official said although Islamabad hadn't heard anything from the Trump administration, it had been feeling US pressure on the issue. 'Trump is taking hard decisions against Muslim countries, there is open talk of actions against Pakistan also. So yes, this was a consideration,' he said. JuD member Ahmeed Nadeem, too, said the Pakistan government had 'buckled under pressure.'

The government, he said, is also committed to combating terrorism and to ensure that perpetrators of such acts are brought to justice. PTI | Updated: Jan 31, 2017, 04.05 PM IST NEW DELHI: President Pranab Mukherjee on Tuesday favoured a constructive debate on simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and Assemblies and funding of polls to eradicate money power. The government, he said, is also committed to combating terrorism and to ensure that perpetrators of such acts are brought to justice. In his address to the joint sitting of both the Houses of Parliament marking the opening of the Budget session, Mukherjee referred to the government's demonetisation decision to fight blackmoney and corruption as also the surgical strikes across the LoC as bold decisions, both of which were received with thumping of desks by members. 'Frequent elections put on hold development programmes, disrupt normal public life and impact essential services and burden human resource with prolonged period of election duty. 'My government welcomes a constructive debate on simultaneous conduct of elections to Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies. Funding of elections to eradicate misuse of money power also needs to be debated,' he said. In the speech, which is the Government's narrative on what it had done during the year and what it plans to do in the new financial year, the President said Government would welcome any decision taken by Election Commission in this regard after consultations. Referring to the surgical strikes, Mukherjee said the government had taken decisive steps to give a fitting reply to the repeated incursions on India's territorial sovereignty. 'On September 29, 2016, our defence forces successfully conducted surgical strikes at several launch pads along the Line of Control to prevent infiltration by terrorists. We are proud of the exemplary courage and valour displayed by our defence personnel and owe a debt of gratitude to them,' he said. Touching on the demonetisation decision, the President said the resilience and forbearance demonstrated by the countrymen especially the poor, recently in the fight against blackmoney and corruption, is remarkable. Later again, referring to the issue, he said, 'My Government has taken bold decisions in the interest of the poor.' To combat evils of blackmoney, corruption, counterfeit currency and terror financing, Mukherjee said the government took the decision on November 8 to demonetise old 500 and 1000 rupee currency notes. 'My government's very first cabinet decision (in 2014) was to set up a SIT on blackmoney. 'The passing of Blackmoney (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act 2015, Benami transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016, Amendments to treaties with Singapore, Cyprus and Mauritius to prevent misuse of provisions in such treaties for tax evasion and movement of blackmoney in India and the Taxation Amendment Act providing for Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana , have together resulted in a comprehensive policy backed initiative against blackmoney,' he said.

NEW DELHI: India gave 'a befitting reply' to repeated incursions (from across the border) by conducting successful surgical strikes+ ' on Pakistan-Occupied- Kashmir (POK) last September, said President Pranab Mukherjee today in an address to Parliament at the start of the Budget Session+ . He also said 'it is necessary to have a constructive debate on simultaneous elections to the Lok Sabha and the (State) Assemblies', a proposal the Centre has been talking about instituting, in addition to advancing the annual budget. 'This is a historic (budget) session heralding the advancement of the budget cycle and the merger of general budget with rail budget for the first time', he said, referring to the fact that the Centre decided to move the budget presentation from April to February. President Mukherjee was making his office's traditional budget-eve address focussed on the government's achievements in the last fiscal year. One of those achievements was India's surgical strikes in POK, conducted as retribution for the terror attack in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir. 'Jammu and Kashmir is affected by terrorism sponsored and supported from across the border. Infiltration attempts, terror incidents, loss of lives there is a matter of grave concern,' the President said. He added that the government is committed to combating terrorism and ensuring perpetrators of these acts are brought to justice. 'India has been facing the challenge of terrorism for the last four decades and it will actively collaborate with other nations to decisively defeat it,' Mukherjee said. The President also commended the country's citizenry. 'The resilience and forbearance demonstrated by my countrymen recently in fight against black money and corruption is remarkable,' Mukherjee said, referring to the hardships caused after the Centre scrapped RS 1,000 and Rs 500 notes on November 8. The Centre said its aim is to decimate black money and corruption. One way to ensure corruption-free politics, at least, is to hold elections to Parliament and all State Assemblies simultaneously, the Centre believes. While the idea is sound, in theory, it is something that must be discussed by all political parties. 'My government welcomes a constructive debate on simultaneous conduct of elections to Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies. Funding of elections to eradicate misuse of money power also needs to be debated,' he said. 'Frequent elections put on hold development programmes, disrupt normal public life and impact essential services and burden human resource with prolonged period of election duty,' the President said. The President also said the government is committed to improving the quality of life of the poor. 'Financial inclusion is key to poverty alleviation,' he said.

PTI | Updated: Jan 31, 2017, 04.08 PM IST NEW DELHI: Ahead of the start of the Budget session, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday hoped for a comprehensive discussion in Parliament. He noted that in the last few days, the government has held discussions with all political parties to ensure that House proceedings are not disrupted. There should be comprehensive discussion for welfare of society, Modi told reporters outside Parliament. The Prime Minister said he has faith that all factions will come together in Parliament for welfare of society. He said it is the first time that the Union Budget is being presented on February 1.

First, the budget is being advanced by nearly a month. And second, Rail Budget in being incorporated into this. There will be discussion on this also and the benefits that it will have in the coming times,' he said. After the Winter Session was washed out due to protests over demonetisation, Modi reached out to the opposition at an all-party meeting on Monday. The meeting was attended by all major parties except Trinamool Congress, which has been unhappy over the note ban and arrest of its MPs in chit fund cases.

PTI | Jun 18, 2015, 10.21 AM IST Above-normal monsoon so far and narrowing of the country's trade deficit perked up mood, brokers said. MUMBAI: The benchmark BSE Sensex regained the 27,000 mark by climbing over 200 points in early trade on Thursday, extending its winning streak to the fifth straight day. This came on the back of continued buying by participants amid a mixed trend in global markets after the US Fed kept its near-zero benchmark interest rate unchanged. Besides, strengthening of the rupee by 25 paise at 63.87 against the dollar in early trade supported the rally. The 30-share index surged 200.65 points, or 0.75 per cent, to trade above the 27,000 level at 27,033.31, with all sectoral indices led by healthcare, oil  and  gas, capital goods and consumer durables trading in the positive zone with gains of up to 1.04 per cent. The gauge had gained 461.68 points in the past four straight sessions. Also, the NSE index Nifty gained back the 8,100 mark by surging 45.75 points, or 0.57 per cent, at 8,137.30. Brokers said a mixed trend in Asian markets, tracking overnight gains in US bourses after the US Fed kept its near-zero benchmark interest rate unchanged and Chairman Janet Yellen pledged a methodical approach to rate increase, influenced sentiment here. Furthermore, above-normal monsoon so far and narrowing of the country's trade deficit perked up mood, they said. Prominent gainers that supported the key indices were Cipla, RIL, ICICI Bank, Wipro and Axis Bank.

Read More PUNE: The ministry of Home Affairs has invited suggestions for proposed amendments in the Prevention of Damage to Public Property (PDPP) Act, 1984. The proposed amendments seek to deter the prospective violators from vandalizing and destroying public/private property during agitations and other forms of protests. The proposed amendments will also deter the office-bearers of these organizations. The Supreme Court had set up a committee under the chairmanship of Justice KT Thomas, former Judge of the Supreme Court, to examine modalities to be adopted to make the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984 (PDPP Act, 1984) more effective and also suggest suitable changes, which could make the Statute more meaningful. The committee concluded that the present law was inadequate and ineffective to deal with the increasing number of instances of public property damage and made some recommendations for amendment in the Prevention of Damage to Public Properties Act, 1984. MHA had decided to accept the recommendations of the Justice KT Thomas Committee. The present provision of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984 and the proposed draft Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act are also available on the ministry of Home Affairs website www.mha.nic.in. The suggestions/comments on the proposed draft PDPP Act (Amendment) Bill, 2015 from the Public and other stakeholders are solicited on or before 20th July 2015 and the same may be sent to the ministry of Home Affairs, CS Division, 5th Floor, NDCC Building, Jai Singh Road, New Delhi-110001.

Reuters | Nov 29, 2014, 02:03 IST NEW YORK: US stocks ended mostly flat in a holiday-shortened session on Friday as a massive decline in the energy sector offset strength in consumer names, but major indexes rose for a sixth straight week. Crude oil fell below $68 per barrel a day after OPEC decided not to cut output, which could leave markets over supplied. The 7percent decline was the biggest one-day drop since May 2011, with prices lowest since 2010. 'Crude seems to have no floor right now, and we could easily see the price drop into the low $60s,' said Tony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust in Wilmington, Delaware. The Energy Select Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund fell 6.4percent to $79.82 while the S and P energy index lost 6.3percent, extending its run as the worst-performing S and P industry group of the year. Exxon Mobil Corp lost 4.2percent to $90.54 while Chevron Corp fell 5.4percent to $108.87; both are Dow components. Shale energy companies saw outsized declines, as $70 oil is considered the level at which shale becomes an unprofitable alternative. Denbury Resources, QEP Resources and Newfield Exploration all lost more than 15percent. Oil weakness boosted airlines, which are inversely correlated to oil prices. Southwest Airlines rose 6.5percent to $41.82 as the S and P 500's biggest percentage gainer, followed by Delta Air Lines, up 5.5percent to $46.67. Retailers rallied as lower gas prices could increase consumer spending. Wal-Mart Stores Inc rose 3percent to $87.54, boosting the Dow, while the S and P 500 Retailing index was up 1.4percent. '[Oil] this low should be very additive to economic activity, not just with gas prices but across the economy,' said Roth, who oversees $80 billion in assets. 'Early holiday shopping numbers should come in pretty strong.' The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.49 points to 17,828.24, the S and P 500 lost 5.27 points, or 0.25percent, to 2,067.56 and the Nasdaq Composite added 4.31 points, or 0.09percent, to 4,791.63. Major indexes rose for a sixth straight week, the S and P's longest streak since November 2013. For the week, the Dow rose 0.1percent, the S and P rose 0.2percent and the Nasdaq rose 1.7percent. For November, the Dow rose 2.5percent, the S and P added 2.5percent and the Nasdaq 3.5percent. NYSE decliners issues outnumbered advancers 1,846 to 1,137, for a 1.62-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,777 issues fell and 875 advanced, for a 2.03-to-1 ratio. The S and P 500 posted 152 new 52-week highs and 21 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 163 new highs and 80 new lows. About 4.2 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

AFP | Nov 27, 2014, 09.01 AM IST CARACAS: At least 17 Venezuelan inmates who had been on hunger strike over prison conditions, died Wednesday of drug poisoning, police sources said. The prisoners at David Viloria Correction Center , known as Uribana prison, in Venezuela's Lara state , had been protesting since Tuesday over what they said was inhumane treatment and rights violations by prison officials, anonymous police sources said. Prison officials said the dead inmates were poisoned after ingesting prescription drugs. How the inmates all came to consume one or more medications was not immediately clear. A non-governmental group, Venezuelan Prisons Watch, said however there were 17 dead at the prison in Lara state, and that four more inmates died at a facility in the state of Maracay. Prisons Minister Iris Varela said on Twitter there had been an incident involving 'prisoners affected by inappropriate ingestion of medications' in the Lara jail. She did not immediately confirm deaths. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

Among the 14 measures ordered by the green court on Wednesday was a ban on petrol and diesel vehicles older than 15 years — a move that's likely to take an estimated 10 lakh vehicles off the road. It also barred burning of waste in the open besides placing restrictions on parking and ordering stricter vigil on overloaded trucks entering the city. NGT, which has the powers of a civil court, sought immediate steps for building cycle tracks in the city and asked authorities to probe the possibility of installing air purifiers at marketplaces. READ ALSO: Jittery owners say they maintain vehicles well The order was issued by a bench headed by NGT chairperson Swatanter Kumar, with expert members D K Agarwal and A R Yousuf, in response to a petition filed early this year on Delhi's air pollution by Vardhaman Kaushik. 'An article published in the Times of India today has been brought to the notice of the tribunal. It not only projects a very dismal state of affairs ... with clear indication that worst is likely to follow,' the bench said. NGT said petrol and diesel vehicles more than 15 years old shall not be permitted to on Delhi roads. These vehicles are to be seized by authorities as per the Motor Vehicle (MV) Act. READ ALSO: Auto industry pushes for scrapping old vehicles It also ordered that the RTO shall not renew or issue registration for such vehicles or provide fitness certificates. If any such old vehicle is parked in a public area, it would towed away and challaned, the tribunal said. 'It is undisputed...that the air pollution of NCT, Delhi is getting worse with each passing day,' it stated. READ ALSO: Burning of leaves — agencies pass buck Referring to air pollution peaking in the morning hours, as reported by TOI, the order said, 'This article declares that it may not be safe for residents of Delhi to go out for morning walks due to heavy pollutants present in the air.' TOI's report on Wednesday had displayed data from the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and Delhi Pollution Control Committee, which showed PM2.5 (fine pollution particles) peaking early in the morning, creating a health risk for those who exercise outdoors. Those exposed to air in the evenings are equally at risk of developing respiratory illnesses and complications, the data suggests. READ ALSO: Traffic cops to help pumps enforce PUC-for-fuel rule Delhi's air pollution levels are comparable with Beijing which has started implementing radical measures such as shutting industries during high pollution days, putting a cap on vehicles on the road and keeping schools closed on bad air quality days. The NGT bench went a step ahead and ordered that any person will have the right to approach the tribunal, police or DPCC to complain about open burning of plastics, leaves and other materials which can result in air pollution. It directed DPCC and Delhi government to create a web portal where the public can upload pictures of any such violations. A 'special force' constituted by the government will enforce the direction and ensure compliance. READ ALSO: Enforcement needed now for results, say activists The bench said no parking shall be allowed on tarred roads meant for regular traffic movement. 'The chairperson was concerned about how Delhiites are going to cope in the high air pollution season that will last for the next six months. He was stern about immediate action on air pollution and gave the example of Lajpat Nagar, where it can take up to 40 minutes for motorists to reach the market from the main road due to congestion. He directed that parking be allowed only on one side of such roads near market areas,' said Narender Pal Singh, advocate representing Delhi government. The bench also directed that cycle tracks be constructed in most parts of the city immediately. DPCC was asked to examine the possibility of installing air purifiers in all markets, crowded places and areas where traffic was heavy. 'We make it clear that in the event of any officer or person found violating these directions or not complying with them, we will be compelled to take coercive steps and pass such orders as may be required in accordance with law,' the order stated.

PTI | Nov 26, 2014, 08.28 PM IST MUMBAI: NCP today slammed chief minister Devendra Fadnavis for not paying homage to the martyrs of 26/11 terror attacks by visiting the memorial built for them. This is the first time Fadnavis has come under attack from NCP which has supported his minority government. NCP spokesman Nawab Malik said for the last six years since the attacks Fadnavis had taken the lead in targeting the then state government over the issue and had derived political mileage. 'But after coming to power, he has conveniently forgotten the martyrs and stayed away from paying homage at the memorial in Mumbai. The excuse being given is he is with the President of India who is on tour of the state. But previous chief ministers, on such occasions, would send ministers in charge of protocol to the President's function,' Malik said. Malik alleged that Fadnavis had no sympathy for for the martyrs. Meanwhile, state unit NCP president Sunil Tatkare visited the memorial of 26/11 martyrs here and paid homage. Similarly, the state Congress also organised a function to mark the sixth anniversary of the terror attacks and observed a two-minute silence as a mark of respect for the martyrs.

IANS | Nov 26, 2014, 05.57 PM IST GUWAHATI: Insurgent outfit ULFA had planned to carry out serial blasts and other subversive activities here ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's scheduled visit to Assam, police said Wednesday. Senior Superintendent of Police (City) A.P. Tiwary said two militants from the anti-talk faction of the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) were targeting city buses in Guwahati. 'We have received information that two tribal boys, likely from the ULFA, are planning to keep explosives in city buses in Guwahati. Operations are on to nab them and an alert has been sounded,' Tiwary said, and asked people for their cooperation. Modi and Home Minister Rajnath Singh are scheduled to arrive Nov 29. Rajnath Singh will inaugurate the all-India conference of directors general of police at the Assam Administrative Staff College the same day. Modi will address the conference Nov 30. He will also visit Nagaland, Manipur and Tripura before leaving for Delhi Dec 1. Police have requested people to inform them if they get any information about the two youth or if they find anything suspicious. Meanwhile, security has been tightened across the state ahead of Modi's visit, particularly after the recent blast in Dibrugarh district that left two people dead and close to 30 injured. Police and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) said a bomb found in a train at Kendukona railway station was being carried to Guwahati to be exploded during the conference.

The flag sports the images of Congress icons K Kamaraj and G K Moopanar. 'It is a significant milestone. We are confident that this flag will fly very high in Tamil Nadu,' Vasan said, evoking loud applause from his supporters in a community hall here. The saffron on the flag signified sacrifice while white and green represented peace and prosperity, he said. Vasan quit the Congress along with senior functionaries and elected representatives on November 3, after a controversy erupted over the images of the Congress leaders in the membership cards. 'I am sure, today's event will assure the revival of great leaders -- Kamaraj's rule in Tamil Nadu and Moopanar's prosperous Tamil Nadu and strong India,' he said, reiterating that his party would strive hard to take to the public the facets of Kamaraj's rule - clean and transparent governance. Vasan moved the Election Commission last week to revive his father Moopanar's Tamil Maanila Congress. However, the party's name will officially be made known in a rally to be held in Trichy on Friday. With the state awaiting assembly polls in 2016, Vasan said the question of alliance with the DMK and the AIADMK did not arise now. 'Especially with the BJP, it does not arise. We have different paths,' he said. When prodded, the former Union minister said the electoral alliances could be decided only at the time of elections. 'I really believe and work to be the first party in Tamil Nadu before elections,' he said, declaring majority of the Congress cadres were with him in all districts.

People familiar with the process say Michelle Flournoy has told President Barack Obama she is not interested in the post. Flournoy would have been the first woman to run the Pentagon. Flournoy served as a top Pentagon official during Obama's first term, and then returned to the Center for a New American Security, the think tank she co-founded. She sent a letter to the think tank's board Tuesday saying she had taken herself out of consideration for the Pentagon job. The people familiar with the process insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter by name. Flournoy's decision was first reported by Foreign Policy magazine.

AP | Nov 26, 2014, 03.55 AM IST OMAHA: Dr Denham Harman, a renowned scientist who developed the most widely accepted theory on aging that's now used to study cancer, Alzheimer's disease and other illnesses, has died in Nebraska at age 98. Harman, who worked into his mid-90s at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, died Tuesday after a brief illness at a hospital in Omaha, medical center spokesman Tom O'Connor said. Harvard Medical School professor David Sinclair said Harman's research inspired thousands of young scientists to work on aging research. ``Dr Harman is one of the most influential scientists of the past 50 years, bringing world-class science to what was once a backwater of biology,'' Sinclair said in a statement on Tuesday. Harman developed the ``Free Radical Theory of Aging'' in 1954, though it took years for additional research to prove its importance. In simple terms, the theory holds that one of the byproducts of oxygen utilization is adverse chemical reactions in cells. The result is aging and, ultimately, death. The medical community initially scoffed at Harman's theory. But by the 1980s, free radicals had become part of research into cancer, cardiovascular disease and strokes. Free radicals have since been linked to Alzheimer's disease. Sinclair said the theory ``is a cornerstone of the aging field. Harman believed the aging process could be slowed by reducing the production of free radicals with a healthy diet, regular exercise and taking certain vitamins. He also recommended not smoking and limiting drinking alcohol. He held both medical and doctorate degrees. Although he officially retired in 1986, he worked for more than another decade on his research before again retiring in 2010.

Of course, Chhattisgarh has single-handedly contributed to this rise, having clocked 247 surrenders by October-end, up from just 28 in 2013. Incidentally, Chhattisgarh has also reported a major increase in the number of Maoists arrested this year. According to data shared by the Union home ministry in reply to a question in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, arrests in the state grew from 387 in 2013 to 517 until October 15 this year. However, the nearly nine-fold rise in surrenders as well as notable rise in arrests is essentially limited to Chhattisgarh. Surrenders in Andhra Pradesh were 76 until October 31 against 82 for whole of last year. Bihar reported 150 Left wing extremism-related incidents and arrested 329 Maoists (until November 15) but managed just 4 surrenders until October 31. Jharkhand recorded the highest number of incidents at 318, highest number of civilian killings at 77, while Maoists killed were 8 and arrested, 364. The surrenders were a measly 17, almost at the same level of 15 recorded last year. Odisha has shown incidents at around the same level (97 until November 15 against 101 last year), but surrenders are down at 80 as on October 31 (from 101 in 2013) and Maoists arrests at just half (67) of the 2013 levels (129). A special session on police response in rural areas of Left-wing extremism-hit states will be conducted during the DGP/IGP meet slated to be held on November 29 and 30 in Guwahati.

Read More NAMAKKAL: Poultry farmers in Tamil Nadu, especially those in Namakkal district, have taken precautionary measures in the wake of bird flu outbreak in Kerala. The Kerala animal husbandry department on Monday announced that thousands of ducks in Alappuzha, Kottayam and Pathanamthitta districts died of bird flu. Though there is no avian flu outbreak in Tamil Nadu, poultry farmers across the state have taken precautionary measures. 'We vaccinate the chicks without fail. But in the wake of the bird flu outbreak in Kerala, we have tightened biosecurity in all farms,' said P Nallathambi, president, Tamil Nadu Poultry Farmers Association. According to the biosecurity method, all persons working in poultry farms should wear separate clothes and be sprayed with a medicine (a mix of an anti-viral drug and salt). Similarly, persons coming from other places for business purpose should wash their hands and legs in the medicine before entering the farms. 'We are using the same method when it comes to vehicles transporting the chickens. All the wheels of the vehicles should be sprayed with the medicine,' he said. Some poultry farmers feared that egg exports would be affected due to the bird flu outbreak. However, National Egg Coordination Committee (NECC) sources allayed the fears saying egg exports would not be affected. 'Countries like Oman, Afghanistan and Algeria are still importing eggs from India even after the World Organization for Animal Health classified India as a bird flu affected country,' a top NECC officials told TOI on condition of anonymity.

Read More CHENNAI: Setting at rest the confusion over the scope of the U Sagayam committee, the Madras high court on Tuesday said the panel would probe only the granite mining-related irregularities in Madurai district, as of now. The first bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice M Sathyanarayanan made the clarifications on a petition filed by Sagayam. The court said it would pass separate orders, if needed, as it did not want to overlap its own rulings. The court appointed Sagayam the legal officer or court commissioner to probe mining irregularities on September 11. Referring to the fact that Sagayam's name figured as an office-bearer in the Anti-Corruption Movement, the judges said if she wished to do public service, he should do outside his responsibilities as an IAS officer. The court also refused to entertain a PIL filed by a PMK-affiliated forum in the matter highlighting the beach sand mining menace. The IAS officer was relieved by the state government for the court-assigned job after a rap from the court. Sagayam later filed the present petition seeking to know whether he should probe all forms of mining in all the 32 districts in Tamil Nadu or to confine his work only to Madurai district. 'I wish to know whether as per the order of the high court, I am required to inspect and report about mining of all major and minor minerals in the entire Tamil Nadu, or should I confine the inspection to granite mining in Madurai district alone,' Sagayam said in his petition. He also wanted the court's permission to have his chosen set of officers to assist him in the probe. The officer was the first to expose the Rs 16,000 crore granite mining scam in and around Madurai.
