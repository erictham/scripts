The atrocities will surely only deepen the fissures and doubts. Can we continue to stick with  Angela Merkel s welcoming ethos towards refugees? Does doing so fundamentally jeopardise  our collective security? And if we abandon that policy of keeping borders open, what, in any  case, would reversing the rules look like? Schengen is in tatters and nationalism is on the rise    localised pockets of nationalism, perhaps, but nevertheless, they are there.  Another open question is whether the bombings in Brussels make a vote in the UK to leave  the EU more likely. The question  do UK citizens collectively want to leave the European Union?   was not framed with these security issues front and centre   not at all. And for businesses and  treasurers, the question remains one of the practicalities of how we arrange our socioeconomic  and political combined interests within Europe. As Colin Tyler points out, on page 19, a no vote  would still commit the UK to the financial regulation that has been in place since 2008, and  bilateral trade and administrative agreements will remain a necessity. Quite simply, corporates  will always need sound and solid trade accords and agreements to operate across borders. But the  attacks in Brussels and Paris are attacks on European unity. How realistic is it that, in the minds   of UK voters, those issues will remain separate?  We look closely at business decision-making in our lead feature. Management has always been  a blend of weighing data and evidence against the intangibles of experience, and even instinct.  Setting up new operations and operating across borders sets distinctive challenges on that front.  Management journalist and writer Simon Caulkin explores the data versus instinct debate on   page 24 and we look, too, at how treasurers weigh those decisions in relation to operating in  emerging markets.  Staying with our emerging-markets theme, Semih Ozkan explores the south-south corridor    the relationship between Africa, Asia and the Middle East, on page 30, and we also look at the  rising importance of panda bonds to investors as the barriers around China s financial machinery  loosen, on page 36.

SOURCE: THE INDEPENDENT,   3 MARCH 2016   WORDS  06  The Treasurer April 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  { CORPORATE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT }  MMF REFORMS HIGHLIGHT   NEW METRICS FOR INVESTORS  Reforms to Money Market Funds  (MMFs) taking effect this month   will affect how investors assess   their cash investment strategies,  according to a report from HSBC  Global Asset Management.  The US Securities and Exchange  Commission s (SEC s) amendments  to Rule 2a-7 of the Investment  Company Act 1940 herald structural  changes to the way MMFs are  operated. The report, Impacts  of Money Market Reform, argues  that the reforms will bring two  new investment metrics to the  foreground: daily market-based   net asset values (NAVs) and weekly  liquid asset levels.  From this month, funds will be  obliged to disclose daily market- based NAVs. In October, when  more MMF reforms come into  play, funds will also be required  to transact based on the measure.  Institutional and large corporate  investors will need to keep a close  eye on NAV fluctuations in order  to limit any losses, says the report s  author, Barry Harbison, North  American head of liquidity product  at HSBC Global Asset Management.  Disclosure of weekly liquid asset   levels also begins from April.  However, from October this year,  fund boards will be able to impose  liquidity fees or redemption gates.  These risk controls are compulsory  for some funds, but costly for  investors   hence the need to  monitor weekly liquid asset levels.  The SEC s reforms are intended  to address MMFs  vulnerability  to heavy redemptions in times of  stress and increase transparency on  their risks. However, these reforms  have already caused fund managers  and investors to migrate to other  vehicles, such as government funds.   { QUESTIONS YOUR FD IS LIKELY TO ASK THIS MONTH }  THE ECB AND INTEREST RATES What s going on at the ECB? Plumbing the depths of monetary  policy is how one analyst described the  latest developments at the European  Central Bank (ECB), which cut its main  interest rate from 0.05% to 0% and  trimmed the deposit rate from minus  0.3% to minus 0.4%  Additionally, the ECB has expanded  its programme of quantitative easing  (QE), from €60bn a month to some  €80bn. It s a response to gloomy  economic indicators   share  prices and confidence are  on a downward path.  Economists have cut  their expectations for  growth and inflation  for most countries. All  of this puts pressure on  central bankers to act.  Surely QE is just more of the same  medicine? What s different this time? What makes this latest announcement  different is a cluster of targeted  measures that are intended to increase  bank lending. The ECB will be buying  corporate, as well as government,  bonds. That, in theory at least, will  make it easier for companies to raise  funds through the bond market.  By taking the deposit interest  rate further into negative territory,   the ECB is seeking to boost  lending. However, it s worth   remembering that  negative rates mean  contracting income  for banks from central  bank reserves along  with contracting lending   to the private sector.  What are the long-term implications  of negative interest rates? The danger is that while banks pass  on poorer interest rates to depositors,  households and businesses are more  likely to just hold the cash rather than  entrust it to a bank. That, in turn,  erodes banks  ability to lend and  creates a credit crunch. We all know  how that can end…  With its latest decision, the ECB was  seeking to offset the effect of negative  interest rates on banks  profits by  providing long-term funding for banks  at low, or even negative, rates. Any light at the end of the tunnel? If the current set of policy measures  proves insufficient, the ECB could ramp  up its QE programme and widen the  range of assets that can be purchased  under the scheme.  SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K     { CONTEXT OF TREASURY }  Cyber risk in internal audit    Organisations are more likely than ever to evaluate  cybersecurity risk as part of their internal audit   cycle. According to a survey from consultancy Protiviti,  73% of companies now include an evaluation of cyber  risks within their internal audit process, a 20%  year-on-year increase.   More than half (57%) of firms said the increased focus  on cyber risk came at the prompting of customers, clients  or insurance companies, but Protiviti s survey found  that a high level of board engagement in information  security risks along with evaluating cyber risk as part of  the internal audit plan were critical to maintaining an  effective focus on information security risk.  Some 92% of organisations with a high level of board  engagement on this issue have a cybersecurity risk  strategy in place. And 83% of companies that include  cybersecurity assessments within their internal audit  have a risk policy.   The rapidly evolving sophistication of cyberattacks  is one of the hottest topics of today s digital age,”  said Mark Peters, MD of internal audit at Protiviti.   Our survey found that when it comes to assessing  cybersecurity measures and the auditing processes,  the highest-performing organisations have audit  committees and boards that actively engage with   the internal audit function during the discovery   and assessment of these risks.”  Meanwhile, the UK government has created a  National Cyber Security Centre to help businesses  boost their defences against cyberattacks.  { CONTEXT OF TREASURY }  Compliance officers under pressure  as new regime comes into force   As the UK s Senior  Managers Regime   (SMR) takes effect,  opinion is divided   as to whether it will  improve compliance with  financial institutions   or make compliance   roles untenable.  According to one   view, the new rules   could result in the  unintended consequence  of making those   roles unattractive   to many compliance  professionals, since  the rule changes make  those individuals  criminally responsible for  compliance failures. The   level of responsibility  could lead to a shortage  of suitable managers.   The need for well- trained compliance  professionals has never  been more pressing,” said  Chrisol Correia, head  of international AML  compliance at LexisNexis  Risk Solutions.  With  the regulators banking  reforms and changes  to accountability, the  importance of the  compliance role has   risen dramatically.   That said, SMR could  actually increase the   risk of compliance  failures in the financial   sector. This is because  skilled candidates are  being deterred from  working in positions   that carry such high  levels of accountability.”  Under the regulations,  senior managers   within banks and other  financial firms will   need to take reasonable  steps to prevent a  significant breach of a  regulatory requirement  from occurring. It   will be down to the  regulator, the Financial  Conduct Authority,   to prove that the   individual did not take   reasonable steps.  NUMBERS   The attempt to create a monetary union has  been damaging economically and it has been  damaging politically within the euro area.  There are no good ways out of it. It s only   a question of the least bad way.” Mervyn King, former governor of the Bank of England,  voices his continuing opposition to the single currency.   www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer April 2016 The Treasurer  07  What do you say?

The owner of the New York  Stock Exchange, ICE, is  expected to issue a counter- bid for the LSE.  Brexit funds The Bank of England has  announced contingency  plans against a possible  yes   vote in June by saying it will  allow banks to borrow as  much as they need in the days  immediately before and after  23 June, so as to protect them  from running out of funds  in the event of a leave vote.  The UK s central bank will  give commercial banks three   exceptional opportunities  to  borrow in an effort to prevent  a repeat of fund shortages,  such as those that occurred   in 2007 and 2008. The move  has been interpreted as a  sign of nervousness about  the outcome of June s EU  membership referendum.  Emerging-market volatility Moody s has downgraded  its outlook on China from  stable to negative over  concerns about rising debt  and falling foreign reserves.  And in Brazil, figures on the  economy revealed that it has  shrunk by 3.8% in 2015, its  worst recession since official  records began. Brazilians  took to the streets in protest  last month, when president   Dilma Rousseff appointed  Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva  to a cabinet post, in spite  of charges he faces in the  Petrobras scandal.  Global oil prices  Oil may have bottomed out,  according to the International  Energy Agency, which claims  cuts in output this year are  likely to be greater than  anticipated. Markets reacted  favourably, with the oil  ministry in Qatar saying that  an initial agreement between  the big oil-producing nations  to freeze output had  put a  floor under the price .   INTERNATIONAL BRIEFING  { CONTEXT OF TREASURY }  FINTECH PLAYERS  TO MAKE INROADS  ON TRADITIONAL  FINANCIAL FIRMS  Financial services firms say  almost a quarter of their   business could be at risk from  fintech players, according to PwC.  According to a study from the  Big Four accountants, 23% of the  business currently carried out by  traditional financial institutions  could be captured by fintech  players by 2021.   In Blurred lines: How FinTech   is shaping Financial Services, PwC  says global, cumulative investment  in the fintech sector could exceed  $150bn over the next three to   five years.  The survey highlights that 83%  of companies in the traditional  financial services market say they  are at risk of losing some business  to stand-alone fintech firms.  Two thirds (67%) of financial  services firms see pressure on  margins as the top threat to the  business, followed by 59%, who  believe loss of market share is the  key concern.  Among the fund transfer and  payments industry, incumbent  players say up to 28% of their  market share could be lost to  fintech players. Banks estimate   that they could lose 24%, while  asset and wealth management  players put the figure at 22%.  A surprising one quarter of the  financial services sector says it  currently has no interaction with  fintech companies. Steve Davies,  EMEA fintech leader at PwC, said:   Given how fast technology is  changing and lines are blurring,   no business can afford to rest on its  laurels. As competition hots up, the  result will be a reduction in margins  and a loss of market share for  traditional financial institutions.  Those who do not act now are at  risk of falling behind as fintech  changes the industry from the  outside.

The so-called Tobin tax, aimed at  reining in currency speculation, would  represent the most interventionist  measure yet on the part of China s  policymakers, calling into question   its willingness to move towards a more  open economy.   The new policy would curb  speculative bets against the Chinese  currency by imposing a tax on FX  transactions. However, the levy would,  say critics, be insufficient on its own  to ease currency volatility and may  also have the undesirable effect of  undermining China s efforts to create   an international reserve currency.  It would have a negative impact on  international markets and investors,  suggesting that existing capital controls  are not sufficient to limit capital  outflows, commentators suggest.  The Tobin tax is named after US  economist James Tobin, who suggested  taking a cut from FX trades as a   means of limiting currency speculation  in 1972.   The tax has a mixed history, however.  In Sweden in the 1980s, for instance,  a Tobin tax resulted in significant  amounts of trading activity moving   to other markets. More recently, efforts   to introduce an EU-wide Tobin tax have  failed to take hold.  Meanwhile, figures from the People s  Bank of China suggest that central   bank moves to curtail the flow of money  leaving the country have already had   an impact. FX reserves dropped by  $29bn for February to $2.3 trillion,  significantly lower than the more usual  $100bn fall.  China s currency is due to be included  in the International Monetary Fund s  reserve currency basket from October.

A research note from the ratings agency  focusing on activity in Europe, the Middle  East and Asia indicated that, while covenant  protection is likely to remain weak, further  erosion of covenants looks unlikely.   Both sponsor- and non-sponsor-driven  transactions saw weak covenant protection  in 2015 overall, the ratings agency said.  However, Moody s researchers expect   high-yield bond investors in Europe to resist  further growth in the size of both restricted  payments and permitted investment  carveouts over the course of 2016. The   carveouts could increase, however, if markets  allow issuers to test investors  appetite for  weaker covenants.  Moody s expects all sponsor-driven  high-yield bonds issued in 2016 to include  a leverage ratio test (LRT) in restricted  payments carveouts. All sponsor-led high- yield transactions will include an LRT due to  the flexibility it provides and the continued  willingness of investors to trade covenant  protection for yield, Moody s said. In 2015,  96% of sponsor-driven deals included an  LRT, compared with 70% for high-yield  transactions in the region as a whole.  Capacity to incur additional quantifiable  debt will plateau in 2016 at around the same  levels seen last year and in 2014, Moody s said.  Road to recovery in the Med  Cyprus has successfully   exited its €10bn international  bailout programme, marking   a significant turnaround for   the beleaguered Mediterranean  economy. Three years after  the Cypriot economy was  bailed out, EU officials have  confirmed that the rescue  programme will have concluded  by the end of March. In 2013,  the Cypriot economy faced  a broken banking system, a  high deficit and an inability to  access external funding. Cyprus  borrowed €7.5bn against a  €10bn rescue facility. Cyberattack on Bangladesh s  central bank In one of the biggest  cyberattacks to date, hackers  stole $81m from Bangladesh s  official account held at the  Federal Reserve Bank of New  York. Hackers are believed to  have targeted some $950m   in separate attacks, attempting  to execute a number of  transactions between New York  and accounts in Sri Lanka and   the Philippines.   The crime came   to light following  press reports in   the Philippines,  where the  criminals are  thought to be  based. The New  York bank holds  the deposits of  many of the world s  central banks.  Bangladesh uses   the account held   in New York for  international settlements. SFO ends FX fraud enquiry  with no charges brought  The UK s Serious Fraud Office  (SFO) has announced that,  after reviewing more than half  a million documents, there  is insufficient evidence to  begin a prosecution against  banks or individuals relating  to FX fraud.  While there  were reasonable grounds to  suspect the commission of  offences involving serious  or complex fraud, a detailed  review of the available evidence  led us to the conclusion that  the alleged conduct, even if  proven and taken at its highest,  would not meet the evidential  test required to mount a  prosecution,” the SFO said.      Selfie-worth  Retail giant Amazon has filed  a patent for technology aimed  at authenticating payments  with facial recognition  capability.

There is a huge degree of  uncertainty, both about the  outcome of the vote, and the  consequences of the decision  on both the UK and the EU.  But one thing is already clear    irrespective of the outcome,  things will change.  Given that the UK is not  in the eurozone, any exit  from a financial markets  perspective should be  relatively uncomplicated,  but the real challenge will  lie in resolving trading  relationships and that will  inevitably translate back into  treasury operations.  Treasurers need to be  prepared for discussions  with their boards   and even  if they don t yet have many  answers, they should at least  start to identify the questions  they should be asking  of their businesses and  financiers. Areas to consider  might include:  Corporate structure: > Will your organisational  structure need to change?  •  Will the underlying  business strategy of the  organisation change   post referendum?    For example, will the   decision be taken to  exit certain markets?  > How will the working  capital cycle be affected?  •   Will it be materially  lengthened, for example?  Risk management: > What might happen   to the pricing of the  organisation s whole range   of financial products?  •  Uncertainty   drives volatility.  •  Credit ratings (and  spreads) may be adjusted,  particularly if sovereign  credit ratings move   post referendum.  Risk reporting needs to be  expanded to cover all of these  issues   and shared widely  across the organisation to  capture  left-field  risks and  ensure open communication  across the organisation.  Treasurers need to  really understand their  organisation, and understand  how their business may need  to change as a result of the  referendum in June.

If so, how?  •  How will any changes in  the strategic plan impact  the balance sheet   and  hence company valuation  and covenants?   Funding: > Will the sources of   finance change?  •  Will particular markets   or products no longer   be available?    For example, European   Investment Bank loans  or EU-funded grants.  > Will bank  relationships alter?  •  Some banks may exit  particular lines or  geographical areas   of business.  •  Some banks may   no longer meet your  investment criteria  (particularly post  bank  ring-fencing / restructuring, which is  taking place concurrently  to the Brexit debate).

Following two consultations in  May and September 2015, the  Legal Entity Identifier Regulatory  Oversight Committee (LEI ROC)  has produced a report setting out  the different uses of information  on parent entities, data collection  and validation.   Entities that have or acquire an  LEI would report their  ultimate  accounting consolidating parent   defined as the highest-level legal  entity preparing consolidated  financial statements, as well  as their  direct accounting  consolidating parent . In both  cases, the identification of   the parent would be based   on the accounting definition   of consolidation applying to   this parent.   According to the LEI ROC, some  420,000 entities worldwide have  acquired an LEI. The information  collected would be published   in the Global LEI System and      therefore be freely available for  public authorities and market  participants. A pilot study is to be  carried out examining issues with  collecting data on parents that do  not have an LEI.   Implementation is planned  to start in the fourth quarter of  2016.

Visibly  quaking before the  onslaught of public   opprobrium and the UK s  dreaded  diverted profits   tax , both Google and now  Facebook have caved in and  agreed to pay a  fair share    of UK corporation tax. Other  American tech giants will  surely follow. Or so the UK  government would have you  believe. But is this really   the triumph in tax policy  claimed? Hardly.  Something is better than  nothing, and both companies  will now pay more than they  used to. But on all kinds   of fronts, the situation  remains far from satisfactory.  Google s tax settlement,  which is hardly being seen   as the gesture of goodwill   the company intended,   has turned into a public  disaster, with the £130m  agreed for back taxes and  interest widely derided as  pitifully inadequate.  It was hard to know who  came out of it worse: Google,  for its vanishingly small  contribution to Britain s  struggling public finances,  or Her Majesty s Revenue  & Customs, which was  hopelessly outgunned by   the internet giant. Either   way, it has put the whole   tax avoidance row right   back in the political spotlight.  Back-room,  sweetheart  tax  deals of this sort are always   unequal contests. The three  or four relatively poorly paid  tax inspectors the revenue  would have had on the case  would have been no match for  the massed ranks of Google s  tax and legal advisers.  Facebook s concessions to  the UK taxman at least have  the merit of being a little  more transparent, with the  company agreeing to book  UK advertising through  Britain, rather than Ireland,  with its more favourable  rate of corporation tax. Even  so, it won t satisfy public  concern about the way big  multinationals meet their  international tax obligations.  You can explain the  fundamentals of corporate  tax until you are blue in the  face   including the basic  principle that it applies only  to where the money is earned,  not where the revenue is  generated   but it won t make  a blind bit of difference to the  public s sense of injustice.  A couple of points seem  worth making. One is that the  fault lies as much in the US tax  system, which attempts to tax  companies on the entirety of  their worldwide profits rather  than just US ones, as it does  its European counterparts.  Punishingly high rates of US  corporation tax positively  encourage US companies to  avoid tax overseas and then  hold the profits offshore to  help defray the tax bill back   home and limit the risks of  double taxation.  It is an interesting  observation on the  corporation tax debate  that the sense of injustice  works both ways. Many  US lawmakers accuse their  European colleagues of  attempting to steal tax  revenue from the US. In  any case, not until Congress  addresses the shortcomings  of its own tax system is the  problem likely to diminish.  The other observation  concerns the very nature   of corporation tax. Almost   by definition it is bound to   be an unsatisfactory form   of taxation, if only because  profit is such a slippery  concept. The Organisation for  Economic Co-operation and  Development s Base Erosion  and Profit Shifting initiative   is unlikely to provide the  solution. It s not just the  public, but business, too, that   regards the tax as arbitrary  and unfair.  If a tax isn t working,   it should be got rid of and  replaced with something  else. In Britain, many large  companies now pay more  in business rates than they  do corporation tax. No one  would regard business rates    effectively a tax on property    as a good alternative, but it  is possible to envisage many  others. The time has come   for a radical rethink of  business taxes in the round.  There is no point in trying   to patch up what is already   a broken system.

This mismeasurement problem has  exacerbated negative market perceptions  that China is cooling too quickly.  Second, markets do not like surprises.  They rarely go down well. Two bungled  devaluations of the yuan, the first last  August and the second in January this  year, highlight China s communication  challenge. In recent years, unit labour  costs have soared and the yuan has  appreciated significantly on a trade- weighted basis. This has cut into China s  competitive edge and contributed to  declining exports. Therefore, a modest  depreciation of its currency is an  appropriate adjustment and a positive  for China s economy. Worries about yuan  devaluations, misguided though they  are, stem from a lack of communication.  Although they reflect a necessary   Following decades of booming  growth, China s economy has begun  to slow. But despite a fearful reaction   by financial markets, China is not  heading for a hard landing. Instead,   the world s second-largest economy   is gradually losing momentum as it  transitions from an investment- and  export-oriented industrialiser to a   cleaner and more developed services and  consumer-driven economy. Nevertheless,  investors are clearly apprehensive. China   is having a hard time convincing markets  that it can cope with the challenges of   a maturing economy.  Part of the problem is that it is quite  difficult to know what is going on in  China. Risk tends to move in the opposite  direction to the degree and quality of  information. Indeed, ex-Federal Reserve  chairman Ben Bernanke spent his  academic days illustrating that it was  in part the loss of information as banks  failed during the Great Depression   that caused borrowing costs to rise   so terrifically. Partly as a result of this,  economic policymakers in the Western  world try to ensure that markets are  always in the know. A huge amount  of resources are assigned the task of  accurately counting all of the bells,  whistles and widgets in an economy.   It is in these quarters that China faces   its real dilemmas.  First, the perceived unreliability of  Chinese economy data has led many  analysts and economists to build their  own proxies to track the true underlying  rate of economic growth. But these   have become outdated and unreliable.  Most of them look at manufacturing  data to track underlying growth. These  probably worked a decade ago, but   not any more. Out-of-date growth  indicators that focus on China s    adjustment to help China regain some  competitiveness, markets reacted on   both occasions as if the devaluations   were a drastic policy response to deep  economic malaise. Why? Because the  moves were not properly communicated.  The Chinese economy has reached   a size where it has become systemically   important for the world. The developed  world is only just back on its feet from  the global financial crisis and is facing  its own political headaches. Markets  worry that a Chinese hard landing could  throw the global economy into recession.  Nevertheless, as has happened many  times before, markets tend to over- rather  than under-react to events. Regarding the  slowdown in China, this is probably one  of those times.  In any case, if China was experiencing  something more sinister than a modest  slowdown, there is ample policy  headroom to buffer demand if needed.  A savings rate of over 40% signals a  significant amount of pent-up demand  if the right levers are pulled. Plus, low  inflation and a policy rate above 4% mean  that monetary policy can be aggressively  scaled up if needed. Finally, China still  sits on $3.2 trillion of foreign reserves, the  largest stock in the world more than twice  over. Altogether, this means that China  has the tools to both stabilise its own  economy and see out the financial market  turbulence until it either learns how to  manage its own growing pains or until the  panic subsides, whichever comes first.

Most banks  and especially relationship  managers are keen not to be  seen to drop out of syndicates    it is a sign of weakness  to do so, but we corporate  treasurers cannot take this   for granted indefinitely.  However, there are   a number of areas where  banks are not as supportive  as before. It seems to me  that a number are narrowing  their offerings and some  have dropped out of certain  markets that were well  supplied a few years back.  They should then hardly  complain when corporates  have to look outside their   After agreeing the latest  round of bank financing,  we proposed that a series   of annual review meetings  with banks be set up. These  were to be formal: the  relationship managers would  not just call in for a coffee, but  would have to appear to be  demonstrating to their credit  and business committees that  their funds were earning them  a suitable return.  The reviews were duly set  up, and a series of fairly senior  London bankers trekked to  our office. We did think of  holding them at one of our  sites, but decided we were  likely to struggle to offer as  much business to them so had  better keep it local in London.  We were thoroughly  prepared, with metrics on  trades, drawdowns and  responsiveness. I started   a sweepstake on how many  times during the meetings  the phrase  ancillary business   would come up   we needed  to move to spread betting  when it exceeded 100. I knew  this would be the key topic.  The meetings all seemed  to follow a similar pattern    review of the year, review   of the business, summary   and feedback on team  members to flatter the  relationship manager, and  then the meaty questions: • Why have we not had   enough (ancillary) business? • What do we have to    do to win more   (ancillary) business?  • We are really hurting due  to pricing and regulation  and capital costs   what can  you do to help us gain more  (ancillary) business?  I donated my winnings   to charity, in case you   were wondering.  The reality is that there was  not enough pie to go around.  It sounded to me like each  bank had promised their  committees that they would  get a bookrunner mandate  in the first few years of the  relationship, and to satisfy  this we would have to do more  debt capital market issues  than needed, just to appease  the banks. That was not going  to happen in practice. How  could this ever be possible in  normal circumstances, and  especially with credit markets  looking as they are at present?  { TREASURY INSIDER }  Is there enough pie  to go around?

There will, in the coming  years, be tough decisions  to make. In my mind I was  projecting forward, say, three  years to think when we may  need to roll the loans again  as to how supportive banks  would be in future. If we, like  others, started to use the wider  range of technologies that may  lead to disintermediation away  from the main banks, whether  it be digital currencies  or other fintech where  traditional institutions might  not be the main players,  then revolving credit facility  pricing may change.  That may be a very different  conversation, and while there  will need to be innovation  from all and focus on the   key value-adding services  banks can provide and  corporates really want, the  whole future of relationship  banking and pricing will  surely remain in focus.   In future it may be the  corporates having to eat  humble pie! Will there be  enough to go around?

SET YOURSELF UP FOR A SUCCESSFUL  CAREER IN TREASURY  treasurers.org/progress  018_ACT_Apr2016.indd   18 24/03/2016   09:57     At the time of writing,  much of the British press  was awash with endless   polls, debates, arguments and  social media overload about  Brexit (or Bremain!).  Like everyone else, the ACT  is looking to discern some clear  paths whatever the outcome  of the UK s referendum. There  is, of course, a great deal of  uncertainty currently about  the outcome of the vote   and the consequences that  would follow, whatever  the result. The ACT has  published a briefing   note on Brexit (see   www.treasurers.org/brexit- briefing) that seeks to identify  the areas where corporate  treasurers may wish to start  scenario planning the possible  outcomes. And let s emphasise  that the experience of any  two companies in terms of  outcomes will be very different.  It s worth pointing out   that, similar to say, Canada   or Japan, membership of   the overarching G20  committee commits the   UK to the financial regulation  we have implemented since  2008. Continued access to  EU markets post a Brexit  would require we maintain  equivalence with EU  regulation. In simple terms,  the UK s continued position  (with approximately 40%  of the EU financial services  market) would require  CRD, European Market  Infrastructure Regulation,  and Markets in Financial   Instruments Regulation and  Directive, and much more to  survive Brexit in a UK form.  As an international  organisation, however, with  members and students in  more than 100 countries, the  ACT has long since taken  an international perspective  on all things treasury. For  example, the recent ACT Cash  Management Conference  brought together more  than 200 cash and treasury  professionals over two days  from across the EU and   further afield to address the  fast-changing environment of  geopolitical shifts, regulatory  change and technological  innovation in cash and  liquidity management  wherever the real economy   is doing business.   I have lamented before  that we don t have a fully   functioning crystal ball, which  makes it rather difficult to  be anywhere near precise.  However, I think it reasonable  to say that the direction, and  in particular, the speed of  evolution in business, finance  and treasury is towards  disintermediation of many of   the structures we have carried  over from the 20th century. If  I had to predict a single word  that will sum up 21st-century  finance, it will be transparency.   That s not a simple response  towards distributed ledger  technology (blockchain as  it s called)   although it will  play its part   rather that the  principles of modern societies  are demanding openness and  technology is the tool that  provides leverage. This isn t   a political view necessarily,   but an economic one. How   do I find out about it? Who   am I doing business with?  Who am I selling to? Where  is my money in the financial  system? How do I manage my  own savings or pension?  So what role do we, should  we, as treasurers, play? In my  view, we will act as the pivot for  these fundamental changes by  standing between the financial  world and what it offers our  organisations and the needs  of our organisations in terms  of the business strategies  treasurers have helped to  create and that will help to  drive growth and prosperity.  I would be delighted to  discuss these ideas with as  many of you as I can, so   I look forward to meeting as  many of you as possible at the  ACT events we have in our  spring calendar, particularly  the Annual Conference in  Liverpool, in May.

One of the real strengths of  the centre was that they had got used to crisis and have developed  really strong and progressive risk management thinking,” says  Drew.  My team was particularly strong at modelling different  types of scenarios and kept reminding me that the storm of the  century happens every 20 years rather than 100 years.”   While in Asia, Drew also experienced first hand the ways  that China was opening up the renminbi. In August 2011, Tesco  issued a renminbi dim sum bond out of Hong Kong.  We were  one of the first international businesses to do this, so we had  to get lots of permissions and assurances from the governors of  the People s Bank of China,” recalls Drew.  It was a market that  they were really promoting, so we wanted to do it. Being one   of the first, we did encounter certain difficulties, but it became  a lot easier, even just during the couple of years that I was there.  It is good for market forces that this is so much easier today.”   Joining a UK institution In 2014, Drew moved back to the UK and into his current  treasury role at the John Lewis Partnership.  In some ways,   I was attracted by the organisation and the people ahead   of the role itself,” says Drew.  I knew this was a company   I wanted to get into. The role is incredibly broad. I remember  the first couple of weeks thinking that I probably should talk  to someone in investor relations about something, only for  someone to say that they thought this was my responsibility,  as we only had  debt  and  debt-like  investors. That would be  quite a quick conversation!”   Reflecting the broad nature of the role, a recent  realignment has seen finance strategy and pensions join the  treasury department. A key focus is to get asset and liability  management right. The Partnership has a large financial  liability with its open defined benefit pension, as well as   bonds, operating leases, cash and a lot of really good property.   The change in structure to bring strategy and pensions in   with treasury is to bring all of this together and really get  it right,” says Drew.  We also get to lead in some areas that  could be perceived as peripheral treasury, whether it be from   From early on in his professional life, Alan Drew   now  group head of treasury at the John Lewis Partnership    had a curiosity about treasury.  I worked at a regional   building society in a role that had a lot of interaction with the  treasury team,” says Drew.  I quickly got bored of what I was  doing in the mortgages team, but became more and more  interested in what the treasury team was doing.”   Drew progressed to the position of treasury dealer after only  12 months in the role. It was then, by taking international cash  management exams, that Drew discovered there was a lot more  to treasury than the dealing side he had been exposed to. This  encouraged him to swap a financial institution for a corporate  position, by joining electronics retailer Dixons.    In seven years at Dixons, my job changed quite a lot,”  explains Drew, who passed his AMCT in 2005 while at the  retailer.  I ended up assistant treasurer there, via a few roles,  and that saw me cover a lot of different topics. In my last year  there, I wasn t really doing much treasury at all; M&A disposals  took up most of that time.”   It was while working for Tesco in 2011 that Drew moved to  Hong Kong. In his international treasury role, he had been  based in the UK and covering into Asia, but the company knew  at the time that the next couple of years would be very Asia- centric, with specific transactions in the region. With this in  mind, Drew s role flipped, seeing him based in Hong Kong,   but then also covering back into Europe.  One surprise for Drew was that he found Hong Kong to be  run more like an organisation rather than simply a region to  live in that had business or finance as its core employer.  It  really felt like a business   there is a chief executive that runs  Hong Kong,” says Drew.  I was only there for two years, but  you could see and feel them doing things to compete with  other  businesses , such as Singapore and the Free Trade Zone  in Shanghai that was opening up. Hong Kong was having  to move, adapt and keep relevant like a company would  competing against other markets.”   While the 2008 financial crisis hit the Western world hard,  Hong Kong had already experienced the Asian financial crisis,  as well as the SARS medical crisis. This experience of relatively   A SUCCESSFUL  PARTNERSHIP  20  The Treasurer April 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer      22  The Treasurer April 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  building out a property strategy to our pension liabilities   and all the complex inputs into pension risk management.   I like the concept of treasury as an entity broadening out to   be ultimately responsible for the full balance sheet.”  The John Lewis Partnership is focused on being able to  differentiate what it offers to partners compared to what they  could get as an employee at another organisation. An example  of that is the open defined benefit pension scheme, which is  something of a rarity for companies today. Drew and his team  have recently carried out some pension risk management  activities, which will help make the defined benefit scheme   more affordable.    The Partnership is fully committed to providing that  benefit,” explains Drew.  At the same time, the retail  environment is increasingly competitive and trade margins  across all of retail have compressed, particularly in food. Being  able to do one thing while the financial backdrop is pulling  you to do something else is a challenge. There is a real focus  on productivity and efficiency across the Partnership and how  we do that in a way that doesn t distract from the partner and  customer offer that we provide. Balancing all of those things   is not easy or straightforward. It brings a real subtle complexity  to the role that is somewhat unique.”  Project Venice The treasury team at John Lewis spent a big part of 2015  rebuilding the way that cash is managed, how it flows around the  business and the way that it can be managed using the treasury  management system (TMS).  As the project was about rebuilding  the foundations, we called it Project Venice,” says Drew.   That has really transformed what we do because that is just  happening in the background, whirring away in the machine,   while we can invest our time in business engagement, business  partnering and thinking about what the right thing to do is.”  Part of the increased investment in the TMS was to help get  a better handle on real-time cash management and optimising  cash resources. This exercise involves using the Partnership s  existing TMS, but changing the way that treasury interacts  with it, as well as unlocking part of the system that was already  there, but not being used.  We have been looking at a lot of  straight-through processing and automation,” explains Drew.   The approach of using the same thing, but just a bit better,  this fits in with our productivity agenda of using existing assets  a little bit smarter. This has made a real difference; it has freed  up my team s time to work more on finance strategy.”   No Plan B When it comes to funding, John Lewis does not have access to  traditional equity markets. So while other organisations would  think that they could always go to a certain market or ask their  owners for some more money as a Plan B scenario, this isn t the  case for Drew, who possibly would not be very popular if he  just walked round the office with a collection bucket.    We have been looking at different ways of funding the  Partnership. Our predecessors did some of that   one of our    There is a real focus on productivity  and efficiency across the Partnership  and how we do that in a way that  doesn t distract from the partner and  customer offer that we provide”  VITAL  STATISTICS  £10bn Annual gross sales    of the business  88,700 Permanent staff, the   organisation s partners  46 John Lewis shops   across the UK  346 Waitrose supermarkets  1864 The year John Lewis   began trading on  London s Oxford Street  58 The total number    of countries outside the  UK where Waitrose s   growing export  business has   a presence    www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer April 2016 The Treasurer  23  predecessors did a retail bond in 2011 that was a really good  transaction. This opens up another market for us if we need   to or want to.”   Drew explains that the focus over the past year for his  treasury has not been on external debt markets. Rather, they  have been looking inward at the balance sheet and financial  strategy, and looking at funding   pensions, leasings and bank  debt   as an adjusted leverage. The company has to be really  mindful of its balance sheet because, unlike some of its other  retail peers, John Lewis cannot do a rights issue.    We are starting to look at landlords providing leases to us  in the same way as we would a bond investor, providing direct  cash to the business,” explains Drew.  My new team structure  supports this as well. We can make the best decision based on  a holistic view of all assets and all liabilities. We run ourselves  fairly liquid and that liquidity has materially increased over the  past year. This is reflective of our review of the balance sheet  as well as market conditions. We do not know what the future  is going to look like, but what we do know is that we are going  to have to be fairly flexible. The retail market could get rather  bumpy, so we have to get our balance sheet ready for that.”   The treasury at the John Lewis Partnership does use hedging  as a risk management tactic, specifically when it comes to  currency exposures. The John Lewis division brings a lot in  from outside the UK, particularly in areas such as electricals  and homeware. This is less of an issue for Waitrose, where a lot  of the food is UK sourced, but the treasury team is definitely  active when it comes to risk management.   By being able to bring a few other areas of the business into  the treasury area, risk management thinking immediately  picks up inflation risk,” says Drew.  This is definitely the case  when thinking about the pressure on pension liabilities if  inflation rates go up. This may be indirect to treasury, but it  certainly fits within organisational risk.”  A business with a difference The ownership structure of the John Lewis Partnership means  that treasury can have a conversation about the economics of  a transaction over a longer period of time, rather than simply  worrying what it may look like in the financial statements  at a moment in time.  It is about the long-term economics,  and what the best thing economically is for partners and  the Partnership,” says Drew.  For me, it has been absolutely  brilliant that I can think longer term and not worry so much  about how the accountants may perceive or present something;  it is about the underlying nature of the transaction.”   This outlook reflects the nature of the Partnership, which  has been around for more than 150 years. It has its own  constitution, and shares the rare distinction of being one   of the few entities, along with the US and the Kingdom of  Bhutan, of enshrining happiness in its constitution, in this case  the happiness of its partners.  The team and I all feel that we  want to hand over something that is in better shape than when  we started,” says Drew.  That is not something I ve particularly  felt at other organisations I have worked   probably because  you know the owners will change before you do.”   Ben Poole is a freelance writer and editor,  specialising in treasury and transaction banking  ALAN S CV 2014-present  Group head of treasury, John Lewis Partnership 2013-2014  Director, international treasury, Tesco  2011-2013  International treasurer, Tesco 2009-2011  Group treasurer, Signet Jewelers 2001-2008  Treasury analyst, treasury manager,   then assistant manager, Dixons Retail  1999-2001 Treasury dealer,    Norwich & Peterborough Building Society  QUALIFICATIONS Cert ICM (2003, AMCT (2005)  ALAN S TOP TIPS FOR SUCCESS 1  It is important for treasurers to spend as much time with  the business as possible, because we, in treasury, are    not the business.

PROFILE    24  The Treasurer April 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  knowledge Few treasurers would feel comfortable tackling new  territories without relevant data on financial and  business infrastructure. Simon Caulkin weighs   up the data versus instinct debate in management  Like the clown wanting to play  Hamlet, management is a messy,  imprecise craft that aspires to be    a clean-cut, hard-eyed science and   many of its ills stem from the effort   to be something it isn t. Management s  besetting sin shows up most clearly in   its seemingly incurable urge to reduce   all the variables it has to deal with to  numbers. As the strategy guru Igor  Ansoff put it ruefully,  Corporate  managers start off trying to manage   what they want, and finish up wanting  what they can measure.”  The slippage is understandable.  Thinking and making judgements on the  basis of incomplete information   the  most important part of the manager s job    is hard work with little certainty about  the outcome. Doing business across  borders and opening up new markets  raise the stakes higher. So anything that  appears to make decision-making easier,  or less uncertain, is likely to be seized on  with gratitude. Then (over)simplification  is also a principal feature of the academic  thinking on which current governance  and performance management  practices are based, in particular the  assumptions about economic rationality  and individual self-interest without  which the underlying equations about  shareholder value don t work. The  result, both practically and theoretically,  is to turn today s management into a  technology of control that attempts to  minimise rather than capitalise on the  pesky human element.  But in management it pays to be  careful what you wish for.  The only  problems that have simple solutions  are simple problems,” warned  the systems thinker Russ Ackoff.   Problems that arise in organisations  are almost always the product of   interactions of parts, never the action  of a simple part. Treating a single part  destabilises the whole and demands  more fruitless management intervention;  management becomes a consumer of  energy, rather than a creator.”  A good example of this is the near- ubiquitous practice of management by  numerical target. Targets seem plausible.  Yet the reality is that performance in any  but the simplest tasks is multifaceted.  So singling out one or two dimensions  to focus on leaves out others of equal  importance that are harder to measure.  What s measured does indeed get  managed, so as with any incentive, effort  is displaced on to meeting the numbers  rather than meeting the purposes     the target becomes the purpose. All too  often the target is hit, but the point  missed. This is the reason that targets  proliferate: the broader the target, the  cruder the unintended result and the  greater the pressure to add new targets  to compensate. Thus, in the UK, the  nonsense of a target for compassion  in the NHS and lessons that engage  students in schools, respectively to  balance pressures to meet financial  priorities in hospitals and to drive  students through exams to safeguard   a school s place in the league table.  Anyone who has seen The Big Short,   a film account of the sub-prime housing  bubble that eventually culminated in the  great financial crash of 2008, will have  seen how, even in finance, supposedly  the domain of hard numbers, in fact  especially in finance, treating a single part    in this case the incentives of mortgage  salesmen and bond and derivative   traders   can have catastrophic results  for the system as a whole, eventually  consuming all the management energy  of not only Wall Street firms, but of   The    INSIGHT  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer April 2016 The Treasurer  25  knowledge IK  O N   IM A  G ES  /G A  RY  W  AT ER  S  governments, too. Failing to take account  of the effects of the incentives, the banks   risk models were disastrously wrong.  Giving evidence to a house oversight  committee later that year, former Fed  chairman Alan Greenspan lamented:    I made a mistake in presuming that the  self-interests of organisations, specifically  banks and others, were such that they  were best capable of protecting their   own shareholders and their equity in   the firms… I discovered a flaw in the  model that I perceived as the critical  functioning structure that defines how  the world works.”  None of this to deny the importance  of science and data in making and  managing decisions. Of course, they are  crucial. The tricky question is, what kind  and when to use them? MIT s Don Sull  put it well. Business education in the  UK and US, he said, has been construed  more and more narrowly as applied  science, on the fundamental assumption  that there are universal laws that can be  discovered and acted on. But other than  in finance, there aren t.  There are useful  generalisations, but in management,  context, timing, personality and history  are everything. The challenge lies in  developing judgement, knowing which  tool to use rather than reaching for the  hammer every time.”  It s striking that many global  industries are characterised by the  presence of a  positive deviant    a  company that is notably successful  although (or because of) adopting  a completely different management   EXPERIENCE WINS OUT FOR BAT IN AFRICA  British American Tobacco (BAT)  has operated in Africa for 100  years, its products are sold in  nearly all the 55 African countries  and it operates through trading  subsidiaries across 20 African  countries, writes Justin Smith. The digital age has increased the  volume, depth and speed of data  and information that is available.  Our treasury runs on information  ranging from outward-looking  economic and financial market  coverage, to internal cash-flow  forecasts for the trading businesses.  In Africa, information is often   of more mixed quality and limited   coverage compared with much   of the developed world. The major  African economies are covered   well by external and internal  sources of information, but the   rest of Africa has more limited  coverage. The treasury and banking  infrastructure is also less developed,  leading to lags in the transmission  of information.  For BAT s treasury, this calls  upon more reliance upon intuitive  judgement to identify and manage  financial risks, drawing upon central  treasury experience of operating  across the developing world. Our  experience is that speed of   response is often vital. Economies  can turn quickly and financial risks  can rapidly emerge, as the impact  on Africa of the current commodity  bust and oil crisis illustrates.  BAT has implemented a globally  centralised treasury operating  model with a design principle that  there will be very few treasurer  roles retained in the trading  businesses. However, for Africa,   the design has been flexed to retain  integrated treasurers located in   four key Africa business hubs; these  roles provide local insights, monitor  regulatory developments and  enable agile execution in places   where it can be difficult to get  things done. BAT s experience is  that it is valuable to have close  working relationships with banks  that have strong pan-African  footprints. In Africa, the treasurer s  conventional toolbox of financial  instruments is often not available    this requires treasury to have a  collaborative partnership with local  business management and banking  partners to identify and implement  commercial solutions to manage  financial risks.

Think  Apple in high tech, the Swedish bank  Handelsbanken, Berkshire Hathaway  in investment (and management in  general), all of which have prospered  by knowing  which tool to use  for  their purposes, and how. Perhaps  the paradigmatic example is motor  manufacturer Toyota. The Toyota  Production System (TPS) is a wonder   of the management world, almost   single-handedly destroying the notion   of a necessary trade-off between cost  and quality, volume and variety.   No one individual knows exactly how  the TPS works. It is a complex adaptive  system that has been evolving for 60  years, and its chief architect, Taiichi  Ohno, resisted all attempts to codify   it in rules, on the grounds that to do so  would stop managers thinking about the  problems they faced. Its  secret  is that  it learns   in effect, it is the expression  of Toyota s accumulated human capital.  The TPS is highly data and measurement  driven, but the reason that it learns is  that the measures it uses   quality, time  to delivery, for example   relate to its  customer purpose, so any improvement  instantly feeds back to the benefit of   DATA PROVENANCE   A SHORT HISTORY   OF INFORMATION SOURCES  The World Bank Group s Ease of Doing  Business Index was first published in 2003  and began by looking at five business  indicators for 133 economies. Since then,   its reach has grown to 11 indicators for 189  economies. It assesses corruption levels   and access to judicial process country by  country. The ranking for each economy   is posited on the regulatory business  regulation environment for the largest one  or two business cities for each economy.  The rankings assess the ease of starting   a business, registering property, gaining  credit, trading across borders and labour  market regulation among other issues,   but they don t cover measures on  macroeconomic stability or the state of   the financial infrastructure within countries.  Ratings agencies have their origins in the  19th century when Standard & Poor s  arrived on the London banking scene in  1860. The AAA to D rating system goes  back to 1924 when it was introduced by   John Knowles Fitch. Treasurers will have  their own stories with ratings agencies, but  sovereign ratings are an important quick  assessment of a country for companies  with a footprint in emerging markets,  taking in as they do, overall economic  conditions, political stability and capital  market transparency.  Transparency International is a non- governmental body that assesses  corruption levels country by country. Before  setting it up in 1993, Eigen worked for the  World Bank in Africa and Latin America and  has also worked for the Ford Foundation.

His reply:  Shortening the  time between receipt of the order and  getting the money”).   By contrast, a surprising amount of the  measurement companies undertake fails  to provide this insight. Unless it does,  the data will not only not foster learning,  it will keep managers in the dark about  the reality of their customer service    which is why it is often so bad. As long  as this is the case, the much-touted  promise of Big Data to improve decision- making and thus company performance  overall is likely to be elusive.  On the other hand, when good  judgement about measures and data  is allied to strong purpose and flair,  the positive effects can be dramatically  amplified. Thus, Toyota s strategic  decision to develop hybrid engine  plants was a judgement call whose  success was by no means inevitable.  If the decision now gets plaudits, it is  largely because of execution that made  the proposition compelling despite a  relatively high purchase price. Look at  the consequences: although globally  second in output to Volkswagen, Toyota  outranks VW in market capitalisation  and stands eighth in Forbes  2015 list of  most valuable brands as compared with  the German carmaker at 67. Toyota s  long-term vision is of a  dream car   whose emissions will be cleaner than the  air it takes in. Would you bet against it?   Or in technology, compare decisions  taken by Apple under Steve Jobs and  those of Microsoft under Bill Gates. Gates  was by far the more capable technically,  but that didn t prevent Microsoft being  serially wrong-footed by Apple s abrupt  product sidesteps, going far beyond  anything that market-research data would  have sanctioned, leaving Gates baffled  and stymied each time. Under Jobs, Apple  revolutionised (for once no exaggeration)  not one, but four, industries: computers,  music, phones and retail (Apple stores,  widely derided as a vanity project, are  now the most profitable retail real estate  per square foot on the planet). Jobs  had another quality that helped ace his  rival s technical and analytical smarts:  an acute sense of human psychology and  motivation. Jobs was often mocked for   his  reality distortion field , the ability  to project a parallel universe where the  apparently impossible becomes not only  possible, but routine. But the laugh was  on the mockers. The distortion field   worked , Apple employees within its  pull performing feats of innovation and  endurance that other companies could  only dream about.  In their book on evidence-based  management, or the lack of it, Hard  Facts, Dangerous Half-Truths and Total  Nonsense, Stanford professors Jeffrey  Pfeffer and Robert Sutton suggest a way  forward. Numerous surveys suggest that  finance professionals have a healthy  respect for the importance of gut feel  and experience in decision-making, in  some cases trusting them as much as  hard data. That s as it should be. But on  their own they are unreliable decision- making guides, being subject to many   psychological quirks, just as the record  shows that data alone can t provide  the will to take bold, but necessary  decisions (just ask Kodak). What s  required instead is due diligence on  the assumptions and background ideas  brought to bear on important decisions.   If the best research shows, as it does,  that most mergers damage the long-term  financial performance of the acquirer,  there is no traceable link between  high CEO pay and firm performance  (and incentives generally are more  likely to demotivate than motivate).  The benefits of reorganisations and IT  implementation are always over- and  their costs underestimated, so you d  better have good reasons why this time  it will be different. That doesn t remove  ambiguity or the need for judgement,  but it does   slightly   shorten the odds  against getting it right. Decision-making  will never be easy, but that s as it should  be, too: if a computer could do your job,  in the end it probably will.   Simon Caulkin is a freelance writer  specialising in business management  THOMAS NEIDERT, QIAGEN QIAGEN, the molecular biology  instrumentation company, has a footprint  in EMEA and Asia-Pacific. The $1.3bn  revenue company s treasury function  was established in 2008, well into the  company s 30-year history, following an  acquisition that brought a debt of $1bn  into the business.  For QIAGEN, operating in emerging  markets while streamlining cash collection  and treasury processes across the entire  organisation necessitated a more hands- on approach than mere fact-finding about  local regulations and banking services  from a distance.   Thomas Neidert, vice president and  head of global treasury, describes a high  degree of reliance on the experience of  people on the ground.   In regulated markets, especially China,  it would be extremely difficult to effect  certain payments,” he says.  We decided  that for Asia-Pacific we needed to opt for  one bank only and then only deal with one  electronic banking system.”  What the company did with its local  banking decisions in Asia-Pacific and  particularly in China was to rely on the   local knowledge and judgement of staff  on the ground. Neidert describes, for  instance, how he would narrow down  decisions on banks and branches by asking  staff which bank they would choose if they  had to choose between just two banks.   What we did better in APAC than in  EMEA was to talk to colleagues to find  out what we really needed and to really  understand the local issues,” he says.  Even so, when operating in a highly  regulated environment, there are hurdles.   When you re dealing with a bank with  many branches [we were advised to]   take care to avoid anything that could   be considered regulatory shopping,”   he says.    The words corporate   and treasurer go together  like bread and butter, but   non-corporate organisations,  such as governmental  organisations, charities and  housing associations, offer  some alternatives.   Profitability is the measure  of a company s success,  but imagine working at an  organisation that has no  interest in profits and where  every penny is earmarked  to help the less fortunate?  Treasury roles in such  organisations do exist and,  while they come with their  own unique set of pressures,  can be deeply rewarding.  The charity sector Richard Symonds worked   in finance for 20 years, either  as treasurer for UK plcs or  in European head offices of  US multinationals. He was  looking for a new challenge,  and landed the role of  treasury operations manager  at the British Council, a UK  charity that specialises in  international educational   and cultural opportunities.   It has 7,000 employees   and an annual turnover  in the region of £973m,  necessitating the need for   a dedicated treasury team.   The British Council   is a unique organisation;   it is a very interesting   place to work and I would   thoroughly recommend it,”  says Symonds.  We have a  front office and relationship  management team in  London, and a back office at  our shared service centre in   India; it would be impossible  to run the business  otherwise,” he says.  An organisation with   global reach, the British  Council operates in more   than 100 countries, with   over 80 banking partners   and 80 different currencies.  It sends out cash to these  territories and repatriates  cash on a daily basis. The  treasury team manages  its daily FX transactions  on a trading platform and  is looking to introduce a  hedging programme for its  renminbi exposure.  The treasury team is also  tasked with finding the best  prices for its transactional  activity; it recently put out a  couple of tenders for banking  services in the EU and East  Asia to find the best rate.  The role of treasurer is  therefore no less rigorous  than working at a corporate,  says Symonds.  There is a  difference perhaps in the  ethos of the business    working at a not for profit   is a bit more relaxed than   at a corporate without being  any less professional.”  Working in the spotlight But working at a charitable  organisation is not without   its challenges, not least  in terms of funding and  explaining spending decisions  to the public. Charities that  receive government grants,  such as the British Council,  have taken a hit from funding  cuts, and increasingly   have to manage their   finances independently.  28  The Treasurer April 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  IK O  N  IM  A G  ES  The third sector, not for profits and governmental organisations  all provide rewarding berths for treasurers outside of the   corporate world. Farah Khalique investigates  Meet the   non-corporate   treasurers    Jenny Hodgkins, head of  treasury at Network Housing  Group, says:  The sector  has very much moved over  the past few years towards  funding itself more like a  corporate. When I came into  this sector, you had 30- to   40-year funding from banks;  now it is a lot more shorter- term finance.”  Treasurers at not-for-profit  organisations certainly   have to think creatively   in order to borrow as   cheaply as possible, given  government restrictions.  Finding a role Treasury roles at charities  such as the British Council  are few and far between, says  Rachael Crocker, associate  director at headhunter Brewer  Morris. Most charities are  simply too small to justify  hiring a treasury team.  Cancer Research UK was one  of the few charities to have   a dedicated treasurer, but has  now scrapped this position.  However, Oxfam has recently  hired a new head of treasury  and has restructured its  treasury team.  People who move into  these roles are not typically  motivated by the pay  package or career prospects,  says Crocker, but rather an  emotional attachment to the  charity. A cut in salary is to   be expected.   is worth it. Last year, TfL  raised a $400m green bond,  and Kilonback personally  showed investors where  the investment is funding  improvements at Victoria  station and on London s  cycle superhighways.  There  is a real connection with the  business,” he says.  The housing sector Martin Watts, director  of treasury at London  & Quadrant Housing  Association (L&Q) also   cites this connection as   one of the most rewarding  aspects of his job. L&Q is  a housing association and  residential developer, owning  or managing more than  70,000 homes in London   and the South East. When   I meet Watts, who is MCT  qualified, at the head office  in Lewisham, he shakes   my hand and points to a  towering construction site  in the distance   an L&Q  regeneration project.  You can  see the end result of giving  something back,” he says.  L&Q won the bonds below  £500m category in The  Treasurer s Deal of the Year  Awards 2015 for its £250m  bond issue last year. Like  many other publicly funded  organisations, housing  associations have felt the brunt  of government cuts in the  form of the social housing rent  reduction, prompting them  to find new ways to secure  funding and manage costs.   We have to be mindful  of managing public money.  We need to generate our own  cash and projects that provide  returns; we need to focus  on value for money for our  investments,” he says.  Funding constraints   and public transparency   are familiar challenges to  Simon Kilonback, director   of group treasury at Transport  for London (TfL). Every  Londoner has an opinion   on the city s transport system;  newspapers write about it  obsessively and when it fails,  nobody holds back.  TfL, whose team includes  a number of ACT students,  has a fixed amount of funding  from central government   and the mayor, and does  not make a profit, instead  reinvesting all its income   into London s transport  system. This means that the   treasury has real sway with  the board, says Kilonback,  because there is real  opportunity to save much- needed money through  treasury transactions.  TfL faces the challenge   of fully covering its operating  costs by 2019   without   any financial help from   the government. If it hits   that target, it will be one   of the first UK public-sector  organisations of its size  and complexity to do so.   As treasurer, I am heavily  involved in the strategy   of ensuring we get there,”   says Kilonback.  There is no such thing as a  typical day at an organisation  like TfL. On top of running  the day-to-day treasury  activities and figuring out   the financing of billion-dollar  projects such as Crossrail,  Kilonback is also involved  with policy work with  politicians and ministers.  The upside of working in  a public-sector organisation  is the collaborative approach  with other public bodies    something that might be  alien to a corporate treasurer    because there is no direct  competition. Kilonback  might take a call from a  treasurer at a major city or  public-sector body to learn  from TfL s experiences, and is  happy to share his knowledge.  But one of the key  differences from working   as a treasurer in the private  sector is the level of   transparency when managing  public money.   We work in a political,  public-sector environment.  We have to find ways we  can balance the need for  privacy and discretion for  certain transactions with  transparency. You are much  more accountable as the  treasurer of a public-sector  organisation; you can be  called in front of public  committees to explain   why you have done things   in a particular way,”   explains Kilonback.  Despite the high level of  scrutiny, he believes the job   Farah Khalique   is a freelance  business and  finance journalist    www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer April 2016 The Treasurer  29  INSIGHT  Treasurers at not-for-profit organisations have to think  creatively in order to borrow as cheaply as possible    30  The Treasurer April 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Over the past decade, there has  been widespread growth in Africa,  with GDP growth rates averaging   around 5%. This growth has been mainly  attributed to the surge in natural  resources prices: the highest price  increases in world merchandise trade   are to be found in energy, followed by  minerals and non-ferrous metals, which  comprise a large portion of Africa s  exports. Yet this is only part of the story.  Improved government performance in  terms of maintaining political stability  and improving macroeconomic  conditions are also widely recognised   as contributory factors.  Increasing economic momentum   in Africa is changing the region s long- standing commercial relationships  with its trading partners   notably Asia  and the Middle East. The list of Africa s  top 10 trading partners highlights the  importance of the so-called south-south  corridor   trading relationships between  emerging economies   with Asia and the  Middle East accounting for around 33%  of Africa s $726.8bn total trade in 2014.  In Asia, China, India, Japan and South  Korea are leading the way. In the Middle  East, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab  Emirates (UAE) are at the forefront.  Trade among Asian, African and Middle  Eastern countries, estimated at around  $4.1 trillion in 2014, shows the growing   significance and connectivity between  these economies.  The Middle Eastern ports, especially  Jebel Ali, the largest in the region,  are among the biggest beneficiaries.  Between the fastest-growing region  in the world, Asia, and the runner-up,  Africa, the Middle East has a one-of-a- kind opportunity to facilitate not only  bilateral (for example, Middle East/ Africa and Middle East/Asia) trade, but  also intra-regional (for example, Africa/ Asia) trade and investments flows. And  for the Middle East, it is not about one   or the other.   Trade and investment flows  The Middle East and Africa have more  in common than many would expect.  In nature, they are heterogeneous  with largely comparable economic  compositions, ie, natural-resources  and human-capital driven economies  with limited diversification. Both  regions take part in global supply  chains, albeit on a small scale, due to  infrastructure limitations. The World  Trade Organization s (WTO) 2015 report  on international trade statistics show  both regions coded blue   the lowest  rating   putting their trade size in global  perspective. Notwithstanding these  issues, the regions are still benefiting  each other when it comes to growth.   Context of treasury The business context  Africa  connecting Asia, Africa and the Middle East have an increasing  stake in each other s fortunes. Semih Ozkan charts   the south-south corridor    www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer April 2016 The Treasurer  31  The bilateral trade flows between the  Middle East and Africa play a crucial role  in each other s economy   the Middle  East mobilises Africa with refined energy  products, such as gasoline, and Africa s  abundant agriculture output helps feed  the Middle East. In 2014, the regional  trade flows reached $54bn and are  increasing, according to the WTO. What  is more, the region s bilateral footprints  are steadily increasing and broadening  in terms of geographies and sectors.  Emirates, along with other Middle  Eastern airlines, such as Etihad Airways  and Qatar Airways, is fuelling the   Africa connecting  narrative by serving   a collective 742 flights per week and  growing. The Middle East s flagship hotel  brands, such as Jumeirah Group and  Rotana, are also taking steps to build  their footprints in Africa. This ever- increasing connectivity is shaping a   more meaningful role for the Middle  East in facilitating Africa s trade and  investment flows.   Appropriately, Africa is very  high on Middle Eastern treasurers   growth agendas. Etisalat, a leading  telecommunications company in  the Middle East and Africa, serves 10  countries in Africa. Emirates Global  Aluminium, which owns Guinea  Alumina Corporation, a mining  development company, is focused   on advancing its bauxite and alumina  export project in Guinea. DP World,  one of the world s largest port operators,  has more than 3,000 people across six  terminals in Africa and growing. Aramex,  a global logistics and transportation  provider, operates in more than 20  countries in Africa. The promising long- term prospect of Africa is also attracting  institutional investments. Middle  Eastern private equity firm Abraaj Group  raised around $1.4bn for two funds  in 2015 to invest in Africa s consumer  story. Qatar National Bank invested in  Ecobank, the leading pan-African bank.   The Middle East and Africa have more  in common than many would expect…   they are heterogeneous with largely  comparable economic compositions  In turn, the Middle East also  offers a compelling trade and  investment platform for many  African companies. Mediclinic  International, a listed healthcare  company in South Africa, owns  and operates a number of  healthcare facilities in the UAE.  The ease of doing business in the  region is attracting many trading  houses from Africa   Export  Trading Group, one of the most  vertically integrated agriculture  supply chain companies in Africa  with a presence in 30 countries,   is based in the UAE.  Even healthy development can suffer  shocks and face risks and structural  constraints, of course. Ease of doing business: Africa has,   on average, the lowest score (51.87) in   the World Bank s Ease of Doing Business  ranking despite some countries, such  as Mauritius, Rwanda and South Africa  scoring much higher than average.  This low score puts Africa towards the  bottom of the rankings not only in terms  of difficulty of doing business, but also  when it comes to the ability to create  and reinforce rules that facilitate a better  business environment. Having said that,  the past decade has witnessed improved  government performance on this front,  which is contributing notably to the  region s collective long-term prospects. Corruption: Africa, in aggregate,  is coloured with the darkest red on  Transparency International s corruption  index, meaning that almost the entire  region faces severe corruption issues  (although it is by no means the only  region in the world where this is the  case). Despite the bad and the ugly, the  good is still in evidence in the region.  Botswana, Namibia and South Africa are  making meaningful efforts to improve  public access to justice and security, and  to reduce risks for doing business   an  encouraging result for Africa as a whole.   Intra-regional trade flows: According  to the WTO, Africa has one of the world s  lowest intra-regional trade flows, 18%.  In fact, the Middle East has the lowest  intra-regional trade flow (9%), while  Asia has the highest (52%), in the world.  The limited regional supply chains are  caused primarily by: (i) significantly   high cost of intra-regional transportation  due to inadequate infrastructures;  and (ii) imbalanced integration into  the global supply chains due to lack  of considered policies. With trade  dominated by natural resources,  this high cost and underdeveloped  infrastructure will be a drag on growth  unless more supportive economic  policies, such as the development of  related industrial and intra-regional  activity, can be put in place.   Without a doubt, the extent of  these problems is hindering Africa s  growth and, more importantly, the  trade and investment flows in the  south-south corridor. Yet the region  is a land of opportunity and offers  the highest rates of return, second to   Asia, on investments. There are no  straightforward answers to its challenges,  and seizing opportunities requires a  high level of due diligence along with  a willingness to navigate Africa s legal,  political and business environments.  Engaging with Africa s growth  story will also require a long-term  multidimensional strategy, flexibility  and a lot of patience. In this regard,  the Middle East is well positioned with  a natural value proposition   not just  because of its proximity, historical ties  and cultural familiarities with Africa,   but also because of its own infrastructure  and capacity to act as a trading hub.  Middle Eastern companies are in   a position to take the helm in the   complex and diverse region that is   Africa and participate in the  Africa  rising  narrative.

KATIE KELLY SETS OUT THE   ICMA POSITION ON KEY AREAS EARMARKED FOR CHANGE  32  The Treasurer April 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Whys and  wherefores  For almost 50 years, the  International Capital  Market Association   (ICMA) has made a significant  contribution to the  development of international  capital markets, encouraging  interaction between all market  participants: issuers, lead  managers, dealers and investors.  Regulatory authorities have  relatively little exposure to  issuers and generally welcome  the opportunity to engage with  them. One of ICMA s primary  markets groups   the Corporate  Issuer Forum   gathers senior  representatives from major  corporates and focuses on  matters of market practice and  transaction execution, as well  as on the impact of regulation  on issuers, with a view to  feeding back an industry  consensus to regulators.  The cumulative effect  of legislation is in danger  of impeding the proper  functioning of the markets,  a fact acknowledged when  the European Commission  recently invited interested  parties to provide feedback  and empirical evidence on the  benefits, unintended effects,  consistency and coherence  of the financial legislation  adopted in response to the  financial crisis. ICMA works  on many areas of regulation  that have an impact on the  corporate treasurer, just a few  of which are highlighted here.  Bail-in The combination of the bail-  in mechanism under the Bank  Recovery and Resolution  Directive (BRRD) extended  depositor preference in  Europe, ring-fencing proposals  under the Vickers Report  in the UK and the Liquidity  Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules,  which incentivise banks to  encourage deposits of more  than 30 days, means that the  position of non-preferred  depositors is now much more  subordinated, the cumulative  effect of which for banks is a  change in their credit profile.  While it is unlikely that      www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer April 2016 The Treasurer  33  Repo documented by the  Global Master Repurchase  Agreement (GMRA) is based  on transfer of ownership:  it is the immediate sale  and agreement for future  repurchase of equivalent  securities on demand for   the original value. Full  legal title to the securities  is transferred to the buyer  on sale of the securities,  meaning that the buyer has  an unencumbered right of  use of the securities, although  they do retain exposure to the  market value of the securities  (coupon payments, market  movements, etc).  The GMRA is a  comprehensive document  that ICMA has sponsored for  more than 20 years. A central  characteristic of the GMRA is  close-out netting, which allows  banks to account for repo on a  net basis and therefore achieve  balance-sheet netting. ICMA  procures legal opinions from  64 jurisdictions for the use of  its members, which opine on  the efficacy of the GMRA and  speak to the enforceability of  the GMRA and, in particular,  the netting provisions.  In terms of regulatory  impact on repo, the Financial  Stability Board has published  a recommendation that  non-central counterparty- cleared repos between banks  or non-banks (and possibly  between non-banks and  non-banks) should be subject  to mandatory minimum  haircuts on the collateral  value. This has been proposed  in the European Parliament s  version of the Level 1 text  of the Securities Financing  Transactions Regulation,  although there would be an  exemption for repos with  sovereign collateral. Also,  faced with the mandated  dual reporting and proposed  increased disclosure  requirements for repo-type  activities, there is a danger    between the parties, the bank  can automatically assign its  client to either the ring-fenced  or non-ring-fenced area.   Net stable funding ratio The net stable funding ratio  (NSFR) for banks has now  been finalised. The NSFR  requires banks to maintain  a stable funding profile in  relation to the composition   of their assets and off-balance- sheet activities. It is also  intended to limit over-reliance  on short-term wholesale  funding, encourage better  assessment of funding risk  across all on- and off-balance- sheet items, and promote  funding stability. The NSFR   is designed to complement the  LCR, which aims to promote  the short-term resilience of  a bank s liquidity risk profile  under stressed conditions.  The NSFR changes banks   appetite in terms of their  sources of funding, given how  much long-term funding will  be deemed to be created for  them; and which assets they  hold, given how much long- term funding they will have   to hold against them. This will  increase the cost of providing  balance sheet, as banks are  forced to take more long-term  funding, which may mean that  banks are even more reluctant  to allocate balance sheet other  than in those ways that are  more efficient for them.  Repurchase agreement Repurchase agreement (repo)  is a safe and efficient means of  investing cash and is therefore  an ideal investment tool for  corporate issuers seeking an  alternative to bank deposits.  Repo may also be a cheaper  alternative to more traditional  bank credit lines. It is generally  underpinned by liquid  collateral and enjoys two layers  of security: first, the credit  profile of the counterparty;  second, the collateral itself.  credit exposure to banks can  be cut completely, any such  exposures need to be carefully  monitored, hedged and netted  as far as possible with the cash  management side of the bank.  Bail-in under the BRRD has  already been implemented  in the UK. Senior debt held  by issuers as well as corporate  deposits held by banks could  all be bailed-in. For corporates,  this is most acute in swaps  and derivatives if they are  considered to be the liability  of the bank. But if derivatives  are collateralised (for example,  with credit support annexes   in place) they will not be  bailed-in.  Ring-fencing Ring-fencing proposals are  just the start of longer-term  structural change. Uncertainty  over their application in  Europe may lead to a more  fragmented approach, but  the proposals will bring about  a change in the way certain  banks will do business.  Parts of the ring-fenced  entity will be restricted in  terms of the products offered  and may no longer be able  to enter into derivatives and  swaps. Banking relationships  and products may instead be  split between different banks  in the same group, each of  which could have different  ratings. Added to this the fact  that banks may start using  holdco structures, could all  result in more expense for  customers. Ring-fencing could  also affect the availability of  syndicated credit facility back- up lines, which are usually  required by credit rating  agencies for corporate ratings.  In terms of exposure to  ring-fenced banks, corporate  issuers ought to consider  effective netting across  corporate treasury products,  pricing for loans and deposits,  and a trade-off with rating of  the entity they will be dealing  with. The new ring-fenced/ non-ring-fenced structures  will be complicated, and  without specific agreement   Katie Kelly is a director  in the market practice   and regulatory policy   team at ICMA  ICMA works on many areas of regulation that   have an impact on the corporate treasurer  of overburdening corporates,  who use reverse repos to safely  park cash.  ICMA has recently released a  repo market study, Perspectives  from the eye of the storm,  which presents a qualitative  picture of the current state  and future evolution of the  European repo market, from  the perspectives of those who  trade, use and support the  market. It records growing  concern that the cumulative  impact of various prudential  and market regulations, along  with extraordinary monetary  policy, could be affecting the  ability of the European repo  market to function efficiently  and effectively.  Allocations under MiFID II There is currently a MiFID II   Level 2 text proposal that  final allocations made to each  investment client shall be  clearly justified and recorded  by the lead manager.  Currently, issuers are able to  execute a bond issue intraday,  with deal execution involving  allocations to 400-500 investor  accounts within an hour or so.  This requires swift and efficient  allocation processes, which  could be significantly hindered  by the MiFID proposal. The  proposal could also affect  pricing and the number of  allocations made, as well as  increase transaction costs.  Issuers may find that they  inadvertently become more  accountable for allocations,   a function that is currently left  largely to the lead managers.   A summary of ICMA representations on  secondary market liquidity, the Prospectus  Regulation and Pan-European Corporate  Private Placement Market Guide will follow   in a future issue of The Treasurer.    34  The Treasurer April 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Context of treasury  The business context   The prize of new capabilities and know-how, shared overheads  and instant access to new  customers and markets can  be irresistible; down the line,  however, it is a common view  that most M&As do not  deliver anticipated benefits.  There are many  contributory factors to  success and failure, much  beyond the scope of this  article. Fundamentally,  however, the quality of  decision-making depends  significantly on the quality   of information gathered  through discovery and  due diligence. Meaningful  insights into the target s  capability to win competitive  business and contribute to   a new single top line are   often lacking.  While predicting and  managing post-M&A cash  flow, setting up new banking  structures and performing  other tactical and operational  treasurer activities all add  value, as likely the only  member of the M&A team  with corporate financial  responsibilities, treasurers  should also be asking  strategic questions about   how the target feeds its top  line; in doing so, adding  increased value to the   team and enhancing  professional capabilities.  The ability to win  competitive business is   the primary determinant  of growth, profitability and  long-term shareholder value.  A review of the target s sales  pipeline and historical order  intake, however, may actually  provide very little insight.  Pipelines are notoriously  unreliable and history is  IKO  N  IM  A G  ES  often less useful than an  insight into a target s agility  and adaptability. As part   of a more rigorous analysis,  treasurers should be asking  six key questions about how  the target feeds and sustains  its top line:  1. Strategic leadership   or tactical management? High-maturity targets have  an executive, who brings  the voice of the customer to  the boardroom, influencing  corporate vision, mission,  strategy and business planning.   They will be the executive  sponsor for major sales  opportunities and will build  collaborative relationships  with their customer  counterparts and their board  colleagues. They will remove  corporate roadblocks and have  the authority and courage to  disqualify sales opportunities  that are either unwinnable,  unprofitable, or both.  Low-maturity targets  have no such board-level  presence and tend to rely  on middle managers to  tactically manage individual  sales opportunities. They  generally lack the authority to  disqualify sales opportunities  and consequently tend to  allow the development of too  many, lower-quality tenders.  From a treasury perspective,  these behaviours will increase  average cost of sales and will  restrict average contract value.  2. Trusted advisers   or suppliers? Targets that develop excellent  senior customer relationships  and work as trusted advisers  before formal tendering  begins are much better placed  to understand the customer s  business and develop winning  value propositions. Trusted  adviser organisations win  bigger deals and may avoid  private-sector competitive  tendering completely,  reducing cost of sales.  Low-maturity organisations  react to customer  requirements that may  already have been influenced  by a competitor. They are  unable to gather meaningful  business intelligence and  fail to develop meaningful  customer relationships with  executive decision-makers;   TREASURERS HAVE NOT TRADITIONALLY ENGAGED IN THE M&A PROCESS UNTIL JUST BEFORE THE  DEAL IS DONE. PAUL DEIGHTON SAYS THERE IS OPPORTUNITY TO ADD VALUE DURING DISCOVERY  Old tools, new discovery     www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer April 2016 The Treasurer  35  management supported by  fact-based decision-making;  performance is quantitatively  managed and other business  functions contribute to  business winning. Level 5: Optimising;  innovative and  transformational culture;  piloting, refining, and  adopting new approaches   and business models driven  by customer needs.  Targets exhibiting Level 1   behaviours will need  significant attention during  integration planning; Level 2   targets will be reactive and  may struggle to integrate  with the acquirer s approach;  Level 3+ organisations will be  attractive M&A targets from a  business-winning perspective.  Supporting integration  planning and execution As part of the M&A team,  treasurers recognise that  customers need special  attention during the  transition, reassuring them   of continuation of service,  and describing the benefits   to them of the deal (not just  restating the benefits to you).  Earlier planning leads   to better outcomes.  The M&A team should have  the information available  to identify the most mature  business-winning process  from the two parties, which  should be deployed across  the new organisation rather  than trying to conflate two  approaches. Opportunities  will exist for each former  organisation to cross-sell   historical pricing intelligence,  as well as supporting  corporate knowledge  management and learning.  Lower-maturity targets tend  to store information on local  hard drives, with no realistic  possibility of sharing or  learning, destined to repeat  mistakes and incur repeated,  but avoidable costs.  6. Sustainable or a  transient capability? When successful business- winning methods are truly  embedded, they are less likely  to be abandoned at times of  pressure or stress. The target s  ability to sustain performance  is key, particularly when  high-performing sales staff  are often headhunted during  the M&A process. Sustainable  capability leads to sustainable  order intake and predictable  cash flow.   Incisive reporting Although supported by  comprehensive reports, the  overall characterisation of  the target on a 1 to 5 maturity  scale is a critical single  insight. Increasing maturity  levels represent increasing  desirability as an M&A target.  Level 1: Initial; ad- hoc, sometimes chaotic  approaches; success depends  on individual heroic efforts.  Highest cost of sale, lowest  contract values. Level 2: Managed; reactive  approach to customer  requests; basic project  management and quality- control processes in place   and some ability to repeat  earlier successes.  Level 3: Defined; proactive  approach to customer  engagement via a tailored  standard business-winning  process; learning is  shared across the whole  organisation. Leading win  rates and contract values. Level 4: Quantitatively  managed; effective  customer-relationship   they often find themselves  negotiating with customer  middle managers as suppliers.   3. Winning teams   or superheroes? Although improving, it is still  commonplace for business- winning competences to   be undefined or limited   to affable personalities   and the possession of   a good network; however,   in today s global and highly  competitive economies, such  competencies fall far short.   Successful business- winning organisations define  critical business, behavioural  and technical competencies as  a basis for recruitment, career  development and succession  planning (incidentally, as does  the ACT). While charismatic  leadership is always an asset, a  reliance on heroes is a liability.  4. Managed or   ad-hoc processes? People typically don t enter  into business-winning roles  because they like processes,  but while individuals may  indeed win smaller deals,  the type of deals that can  transform an organisation s  balance sheet are invariably  won by multidisciplinary  teams. Winning teams have  winning strategies, executed  through disciplined processes,  balancing both delivery and  opportunity risks.  Lower-maturity targets fail  to harness their full corporate  capabilities. Their ad-hoc and  sometimes chaotic approaches  burn cash and waste resources.  Treasurers, as part of the  M&A team, should be able  to characterise the target as  part of risk management and  integration planning.  5. Knowledge  management or  scattered information? Effective business-winning  targets have a knowledge- management infrastructure  that can provide opportunity,  customer, competitor and   existing services to new  customers; this will need  to be carefully planned and  communicated by customer- relationship managers to  realise order intake and   cash benefits.  Relationship between  maturity levels and KPIs Two key business-winning  key performance indicators  (KPIs) are win rate (tenders  won/tenders submitted)  and capture ratio (value of  tenders won/value of tenders  submitted). While there are  many factors influencing  business-winning success   (not least of which is having   a desirable product or service),  there is evidence (see 1 and  2 below) to suggest, all other  factors being equal, that there  is a positive correlation for  complex sales and the top line.  Level 3+ organisations  engage with the customer  earlier and at a more senior  level, allowing them to access  larger budgets and add more  value; they are attractive M&A  targets when considering top- line performance.

WARUT PROMBOON LOOKS AT HOW THEY MIGHT EASE THE PATH FOR FOREIGN INVESTORS  36  The Treasurer April 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Growing panda  that eats dim sum   Everyone is talking  about panda bonds (or renminbi-denominated  bonds issued by international  issuers), even when investor  confidence in both China s  growth story and the  renminbi s value seem   to be waning, albeit not  unanimously. We, on the  other hand, think panda  bonds are on their way   to becoming international  bonds similar to G3 bonds,  not because of the Chinese  economy, but because the  Chinese regulators will likely  make this happen. However,  many challenges remain. The  first and foremost would be  evolving regulations for the  panda bond market.  It seems unlikely that  the People s Bank of China  (PBOC) will drastically  devalue the renminbi.  Instead, the bank will defend  its currency value using its FX  reserves to buy renminbi or  perhaps adjusting its policies  to stem capital flights. These  flights could be slowed by  expanding the panda bond  market, a move that would   boost onshore liquidity.  Panda bond development  may well come at the expense  of offshore renminbi-bond  markets or so-called dim   sum bonds.   According to Bloomberg,  panda bond issuance has  risen to RMB 21bn (at   the time of writing) from   RMB 2bn at the end of 2014.  And yet the size of the panda  bond market was only 0.04%  of the total onshore renminbi  bonds (also known as Chinese  yuan (CNY) bonds and worth  RMB 47 trillion). The closest  local currency bond market  is the Japanese local currency  bond market, including  Japanese yen (JPY) or samurai  bonds issued outside Japan.   Samurai bonds accounted  for 2.5% of all outstanding  JPY bonds. We plotted local  currency outstanding bonds  in Japan, the eurozone and  China against their respective  M2 money supplies (see table,  opposite) and found that CNY  bonds have a long way to go  before they reach 100% of  China s M2 money supply. We  expect the share held by panda   bonds in total outstanding  CNY bonds to rise towards  2.5% in the near future from  the current 0.04%.  The International Finance  Corporation (IFC) has  predicted that panda bonds  outstanding would exceed  $50bn by 2020. We think  the CNY bond market could  grow in the same way as  the JPY bond market did in  2006. It took Japan four to  five years from 2006 to grow  its domestic bond market  from a third of the size of the  country s M2 money supply  to the 50% mark. Assuming  that outstanding CNY bonds  will account for 50% of  China s M2 money supply  ($21.5 trillion) in China   by 2020 (the same as their  level in 2015, a conservative  estimate) and 2.5% of these  will be the panda bond share  of total outstanding CNY  bonds, so the outstanding  panda bonds could rise to  $268bn by 2020.   RMB 364.3bn and RMB  175.6bn of dim sum bonds  will mature in 2016 and  2017, respectively, according   to Bloomberg. If Chinese  regulators continue to allow  these issuers to use panda  bond proceeds outside China,  declining onshore yields and  rising onshore liquidity will  motivate issuers to sell panda  bonds to refinance their dim  sum bonds. Issuers of dollar  bonds may even consider  selling panda bonds to  diversify their investor bases  and reduce currency risk.   Panda bond development  will also help expand the  CNY bond market and,  unintentionally, cannibalise  the dim sum bond market.  About 95% of CNY bond  investors are Chinese  accounts, and a loss of foreign  investor confidence in the  Chinese economy will not  affect demand for CNY bonds  so much as that for dim  sum bonds (of which most  investors are foreign accounts).  It is true that panda  bonds can be issued by any  entities outside China, as  long as they are approved by  Chinese regulators. For non- Chinese issuers, we expect  panda bonds to be issued by      www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer April 2016 The Treasurer  37  This could mean that US  and Japanese issuers are less  likely than their European  counterparts to issue panda  bonds. Moreover, the existing  rule requires three years  of financial results, with  management discussion  in Chinese for all panda  bond issuers. Translation  or conversion of foreign  accounting standards into  CAS takes time and could  slow down panda bond  development. In short,  exemptions from the  accounting standard are not  clearly explained and this  is an area where the PBOC  could clarify the rules so that  corporate treasurers can plan  their renminbi financing.   4. Foreign dealing will  speed up panda bond  development. Foreign  investors accounted for only  about 2% of outstanding  CNY bonds at the end of 2015,  according to Reuters. The  PBOC announced last July  that sovereign wealth funds,  supranational institutions  and central banks would no  longer need pre-approval to  invest in China s interbank  bond market. In our view,  this will increase demand  for good-quality investment- grade corporate and quasi- sovereign panda bonds due   to limited risk appetite  of these institutions. The  inclusion of renminbi in the  IMF s special drawing rights  means that central banks  will increase renminbi- denominated assets,  including panda bonds.   5. Chinese property  developers have recently  issued private-placement  panda bonds listed on the   reason many issuers are  interested in issuing panda  bonds. Second, the Chinese  government s determination  to expand the panda bond  market will encourage PBOC  to relax this rule.  2. Panda bonds must  be rated by Chinese  credit rating agencies.  International investors and  issuers may not be familiar  with Chinese rating agencies,  and their lack of a relationship  with them may prolong the  underwriting period and  deter international issuers  altogether. However, many  issuers, such as Daimler and  Canada s British Columbia  province, have received  exemptions on the Chinese  credit rating requirement.  3. Panda bond issuers must  adopt Chinese Accounting  Standards (CAS), which  could be difficult for  international issuers and  underwriters to understand.  Daimler has been allowed to  simply explain the difference  in its IFRS-based and CAS- based figures without having  to re-release its financial  statements under CAS. We  understand that PBOC has,   to some extent, acknowledged  the validity of the IFRS, but  has not offered much of an  opinion on Japanese and  US accounting standards.   investment-grade issuers,  specifically sovereigns,  quasi-sovereigns, provincial  governments, and high- quality financial institutions  and corporates. For Chinese  issuers incorporated outside  China, we believe that the  panda bond new issuer list  will be similar to that of  regular CNY and/or dim sum  bonds. In other words, the  panda bonds issued by these  entities will be a mixed bag  of investment- and non- investment-grade credits.  We said the Chinese  regulators will jump-start   the panda bond market.  Now let s look at how the  regulators could amend the  current panda bond rules   to accomplish just that.  1. Panda bond proceeds  usually cannot be taken  outside of China. We  believe that this rule stalled  the growth of the panda  bond market in the past. The  IFC launched the first-ever  panda bonds back in 2005.  Since then, only IFC, Asian  Development Bank and  Daimler have issued, until last  year, when some panda bond  issuers received exemptions  to repatriate proceeds   outside China. We expect   the exemptions to become an  official rule for two reasons.  First, the ability to repatriate  proceeds is perhaps the main   Warut Promboon is chief  rating officer at Dagong  Global Credit Rating Ltd   in Hong Kong  Panda bond proceeds usually cannot  be taken outside of China. We believe  that this rule stalled the growth of the  panda bond market in the past  exchanges instead of issuing  panda bonds in the interbank  market. We understand  that the former merely  requires approval from the  China Securities Regulatory  Commission (CSRC) and  preregistration with an  exchange. Private placements  do not have as many  requirements, such as the  40% maximum debt limit (of  net assets) for additional CNY  bond issuance. In addition,  these private-placement  panda bonds do not require  Chinese credit ratings.   These exchange-traded  panda bonds will be less  liquid than those traded in   an interbank market, which   is far bigger in size. This could  mean that issuers of such  exchange-traded bonds will  pay higher coupons than for  panda bonds listed in the  interbank market. However,  looser supervision and  regulations could mean that  exchange-traded panda bonds  would be much quicker to  issue and, as a result, would  immediately benefit from  existing onshore liquidity.  The speed of panda bond  development depends on  how efficiently the Chinese  regulators move, in our view.  The time for panda bonds is  now and it could not be more  necessary (for the Chinese  regulators) than ever to push  panda bonds to become  a prominent global fixed- income product.

While it is understandable  that companies are pulling   back on significant  investment decisions against  a backdrop of political   and economic uncertainty,   by waiting to invest,  companies risk falling  behind the times, and their  competitors. Technology,   for instance, is changing  at such a rapid pace   and  disrupting entire sectors    that delayed investment   could not only hamper  business productivity, but   are not easy to discern. Some  industry observers believe  that the growth of low-paid  and low-skilled jobs in the  post-crisis period is partly   to blame. But the number   of companies building up  their cash reserves and  cutting back or delaying  strategic investments also  has a role to play. In the 47th  edition of the Lloyds Bank  Business in Britain report,  which surveys 1,500 small to  medium enterprises across  the UK, we found that, while  British businesses continue   to have a relatively upbeat  view on the economy in the  short term, the prospects   severely impact commercial  viability, too.  The investment  compromise  The productivity challenge  is a key economic issue  for the UK, and continued  investment across industries  will be central to ensuring   the UK remains competitive  on the global stage.

The most successful  businesses are likely to be    Despite rising employment, productivity in the UK  has fallen further behind other  leading Western economies  than at any other time since  comparable records began in  1991. According to the latest  figures from the Office for  National Statistics, in 2014,  the UK s productivity was 18%  lower than the average of the  remaining G7 economies.  What s more, the UK s  manufacturing sector was  shown to be an astonishing  45% less productive than that  of the US.

As a senior  secured lending facility, ABL  enables borrowers to leverage  their existing asset base  spanning plant, machinery  and property, as well as  receivables and inventory  to support straightforward  working capital liquidity.   ABL has become an area  of focus for the advisory  and corporate finance  communities as the demand  for more  borrower-friendly   options has increased. Given  their fully asset-secured  nature, ABL solutions allow  for the release of greater  leverage multiples and help  the release of liquidity into   a business.   The right tool for   the right job So, while making investments  doesn t come easily in the  current market environment,  using tools such as asset  finance and ABL can help  treasurers to ensure that  they fund their new assets  effectively and leverage their  existing business assets in the  best way possible. Moreover,  these solutions can offer  businesses greater control  over their liquidity position  and improved diversification  in their funding mix.  In an economic context  plagued by numerous  uncertainties, it is still true  that capital expenditure  cannot be postponed  indefinitely. The productivity  challenge focuses the need to  replace older equipment and  invest in new technologies  that drive competitive  advantage and support  growth into new markets.  Asset finance and ABL carry   Asset finance brings  specific advantages for  financing capital projects.  These structures are designed  for this purpose, and as  they have a specific tangible  asset as collateral, they are  less likely to impact existing  covenants and credit limits.  Different types of lease  or asset finance can be  structured very specifically   to support delivery of a  project   for example, cash  advances can be matched  with project cash flows, which  are released as the underlying  asset gains in value and  begins to generate cash.  A wide range of assets can  be appropriate as funding  collateral, making asset- based financing an attractive  opportunity for many  industries. Manufacturing is  an obvious one, but fundable  assets are widespread and  most UK industries are   able to consider this as an  alternate source of funding.  Most recently, we have  supported clients using this  style of funding to procure  critical technology to improve  key system performance  and data resilience. This is  particularly topical given the  rising threat of cyberattacks  and the media attention that  downtime inevitably draws.  Use of existing assets to  support working capital  The range of sectors that can  use asset finance funding to  secure the purchase of new  equipment highlights how  much value is locked up in  assets already held by UK  businesses. It is estimated  that £2.3 trillion of assets,  held on the balance sheets  of UK businesses, could  potentially be used to fund  further growth.   those that endeavour to do  so in ways that do not inhibit  the business and enable it to  make the investments that  drive longer-term efficiencies.  Well-planned investments  have the potential to reduce  production overheads,   deliver quality enhancements  for customers and drive  overall productivity.   Driving competitive  advantage is not about  cutting short-term costs, but  positioning the company so  that it has a stable cost base  over the long term and can  take advantage of commercial  opportunities as they arise.   The increasingly strategic  role played by treasury teams  recognises the need to find  ways to fund investment in  the company s future and  requires them to consider  the increasingly diverse  range of alternative funding  mechanisms. Some cash   can be unlocked from the  working capital cycle by  improving the efficiency   of the financial supply   chain, but alternate and   more vigorous solutions are  needed to fund meaningful  capital projects.   Alternative funding   for asset acquisition  The use of asset finance  and leasing in the UK has  become more attractive and  popular in recent years, as  evidenced by reports from  bodies including the Finance  & Leasing Association (FLA).  According to a recent FLA  study, asset finance was used  to fund nearly 32% of UK  investment in machinery,  equipment and purchased  software in 2015. This  represents a 15% increase  on the £26bn of funding  advanced in 2014.

The benefits of an  established relationship   with a trusted bank can bring  these capabilities together  and link them on a cross- functional basis with the  business teams to deliver   a whole solution.   ASSET FINANCE AND ASSET- BASED LENDING AT A GLANCE Asset finance  Asset finance or leasing can be an  important complement to traditional  forms of financing, aligning capital  expenditure programmes and investment  to appropriate financing facilities.  Capital projects that involve a wide  variety of asset types, physical and  intangible, are likely to be appropriate  for asset finance.   This can be used to fund the  acquisition of new business-critical  assets enabling productivity gains, the  development of competitive advantage  and, ultimately, growth.  Asset-based lending (ABL)  ABL is a senior secured lending facility  that allows a borrower to leverage not  only their invoices (receivables), but also  their stock (inventory), plant, machinery  and property. Advances are based upon  eligible security with formulas against  each individual asset type.   This can be used for straightforward  working capital liquidity or to provide  more leveraged solutions to support  transactional funding.  The increasingly strategic role played by treasury  teams recognises the need to find ways to fund   investment in the company s future    40  The Treasurer April 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Treasury operations Technology  Going up While this elevation  of treasury has been  happening, there have also  been changes in the way we  choose, use, access, support,  budget and pay for IT   and  our expectations of it.  PC- based applications changed  the life of treasury and  cloud will do the same,” says  Cindy Murray, head of global  treasury product platforms  and digital channels,  Bank of America Merrill  Lynch. The relative ease of  deployment, avoidance of  high upfront hardware and  software costs, plus reduced  IT maintenance costs are  among the potential benefits  already attracting treasurers.  For luxury travel company  Scenic, these were just some  of the things that recently  pulled it in the direction  of a cloud platform for  integrated cash and risk  management (from Reval).   We need to enhance our  reporting capability in   order to ensure that senior  management is provided  with real-time information  upon request,” says Christian  Azzopardi, Scenic treasury  manager. As well as meeting  functional treasury and  management reporting   needs, there was another   big pull factor:  We don t  need to have internal IT  resources to implement it,”  adds Azzopardi.  It is a paradox that, as IT  has become more important  to treasury and other parts  of the business, many in- house IT departments have  become less important. As  digital technologies have been  consumerised, IT has been  democratised and demystified.  So, although treasurers  want access to the latest and  greatest technology resources,  they don t always want or need  an IT department or treasury  technology department  to make decisions about  which technology resources  are best for treasury and   IL LU  ST R  AT IO  N : S  H U  TT ER  ST O  C Kthe position that an ERP   treasury module was the only  possible solution. I had to  push back hard to justify a  treasury management system  [TMS]. They didn t seem to  understand why I wanted  what was best for treasury,  not what was cheapest and  easiest for IT.”   It rarely comes to pistols  at dawn. Historically, Sandra  and the IT crowd have  almost always pulled rank  on Hector and his fellow  treasurers on treasury  technology decisions;  in many organisations,  they still do. But since the  financial crisis, the position  of many treasurers has been  strengthened, enabling  them to exert more influence  over treasury technology  decisions; whether this   means arguing for or   against the treasury   module of an ERP, for   or against a TMS, or  e-banking, trading or   another treasury tool.  A SUCCESSFUL TREASURY FUNCTION DEPENDS ON GOOD DEPLOYMENT OF  TECHNOLOGY. BUT CAN TREASURY S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE IT DEPARTMENT SURVIVE   DEVELOPMENTS SUCH AS CLOUD COMPUTING? LESLEY MEALL INVESTIGATES  FRIENDS OR ENEMIES?   Meet Sandra. She s  an IT specialist and manager with a Big   Four professional services  firm, where she specialises   in treasury transformation  projects   and when it   comes to technology, she s  unashamedly a fan of  enterprise resource planning  (ERP) systems.  If a company  is an SAP customer, my  starting position is to  consider the SAP treasury  module to see if it will work.  It makes sense to leverage   a platform that is already   part of the company s IT  infrastructure, something   it is already invested in,”   she explains.  Meet Hector. He s group  treasury director for a mining  company, where he has spent  the past three years juggling  his day job and a treasury  transformation project   and  when it comes to technology,  he s unashamedly not a  fan of ERP. He says:  IT  came to this project with      www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer April 2016 The Treasurer  41  compliance and regulation,  and they are right there  building that functionality  into the system,” she says.   Analytics is one of the areas  where emerging technologies  may have a radical impact  on what treasurers can  achieve with IT in the future,  because whether this type  of software is embedded in  specialist applications, or  accessed through general- purpose systems, it can be  used to uncover patterns  and potential issues that  might otherwise be missed.  As one group treasurer  explained in a previous issue  of The Treasurer (see www. treasurers.org/node/307758),  by using a predictive analytics  tool to detect patterns in  warranty claim findings,  treasury has reduced the  impact these unplanned  events have on the company s  cash management.  Because data analytics  can provide valuable  insights across a spectrum  of treasury and finance  topics, it is important for  the treasurer (and the CFO)  to ensure that deployments  are not seen purely, or even   bank communication and  reconciliation plus various  other treasury processes for  almost seven years.  Security is another area  where the chief information  officer (CIO), chief  technology officer (CTO) or  chief information security  officer (CISO) and the head  of treasury may differ on  the relative safety of cloud.  Colleemallay does not lie  awake at night worrying  about the safety and security  of the various cloud-based  services that Dassault relies  on.  As long as our service  provider is audited each year  and certified SAS 70, and   we keep monitoring that,   I believe that they are quite  safe,” he says. You are more  likely to find this kind of  independent certification at   a cloud service provider than  in many small enterprises.   Analyse this Perceived lack of IT security  wasn t a barrier for the Lam  Research Corporation either.  When it decided to explore  data analytics to see how it  could improve its investment  reporting, it also opted for  a cloud service provider:  Clearwater.  I see them as an  extension of our team,” says  Tamara Anthony, director of  treasury, at Lam.  Clearwater  is very up to date on   then take responsibility for  the implementation and  maintenance and upgrades.   Going down Because of the reduced need  for their services, it is not  unheard of for in-house IT  departments to discourage  the spread of cloud-based  software and services. Kevin  Salter, IT director of 2020  Innovation Group, recalls  a conversation he had last  year at a company that was  planning a switch from servers  on the premises to servers in  the cloud.  The IT guy was  about to move on and leave  the company, and he admitted  to me,  We should probably  have done this 12 months ago,  but I like my servers ,” says  Salter. The perspectives of  incumbent IT staff may not  always be impartial.   Incumbent IT staff with  a vested interest in keeping  their jobs have been known to  criticise the cumulatively high  costs of the cloud s pay-as-you- go approach. However, John  Colleemallay, director of group  treasury with technology  company Dassault Systèmes,  suggests that these costs can  be offset against the reduced  costs for expensive internal  IT staff   and he should  know. Dassault has been  using a cloud-based solution  for cash management,   Lesley Meall is a freelance  journalist specialising in  technology and finance  Analytics is an area where emerging  technologies may have a radical impact  on what treasurers can achieve with IT  primarily, as IT projects. Neglect  this and it could become a  missed opportunity. However,  treasurers may need to fight  over the next few years to hold  their ground if they want to be  as involved in the selection and  implementation of emerging  analytics systems as they have  been over the past few years in  cloud-based systems for treasury  and risk management.   We will see greater influence  by IT in treasury technology  decisions during 2016,” says Bob  Stark, vice president, strategy,  at Kyriba, a cloud treasury  software specialist.  It s because  organisations are fully embracing  the cloud, but the CIO, CTO,  CISO, etc, are realising that their  treasury teams have been taking  rogue decisions.” Perhaps the big  beasts of treasury or IT will pull  rank; perhaps they will find a way  to balance best practice in IT with  what s best for treasury; perhaps  Sandra and Hector will end up  duelling with pistols at dawn.

A Close tie B Loose tie  If you answered A, close tie,  the strong personal network  that would do anything  for you, you are among the  majority who answered  this question. It s natural to  think that those closest to us  would have our best interests  at heart. After all, friends  don t let friends fail. If you  selected this answer, most  likely you have a strong group  of close friends and family  that you depend on and who  depend on you. However,  when looking for a job, or  for business opportunities,  the broader and looser your  network, the more successful  your search is likely to be.  Our close ties often share our  same networks of contacts    they know who you know.   If you answered B, loose  tie, you may already know  how powerful a wide network  of loose tie contacts can  be. At the least, it gives us  the opportunity to connect  with friends of friends or  acquaintances who, in turn,  can provide a bridge to   other contacts.  But loose tie networks   are more powerful than that.  Since many of these contacts  are less directly tied to you,  they are less concerned   with mitigating risk on   your behalf.  In his landmark work,  The Strength of Weak Ties,  Stanford sociologist Mark  Granovetter studied people  who were searching for jobs   Networks are not the  same as networking.  Networks are the   various groups with whom  we are associated, while  networking implies that   we are using our networks  in a deliberate way to   further our personal   or professional goals.  Your network can be   a powerful resource. The  mantra:  It s not what you  know, but who you know    is all too true when it comes  to getting an interview or  providing critical access  to information. What a  difference it would make if,  instead of focusing only on  the number of contacts in  our networks, we worked  instead at forming a  community of support for  our future. Who wouldn t  want an interconnected  group of people capable   of helping us to land jobs,  find new business, solve   a problem or support us   in times of crisis?  The two networks  everyone has You already have at least  two different types of  networks in your life:  personal and professional.  Personal networks are   www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer April 2016 The Treasurer  45  to find out what role their  social networks played in  landing one. He found that  people who used loose tie  connections had greater  success in job searches,  experienced greater levels   of job satisfaction and made  more money. Since loose  tie contacts are a bit more  removed, they see the world  a little differently and can  evaluate risk with a more  objective view.  Maybe no one in your close  circle of friends and family  has started a company before,  worked in a high-risk venture  or quit a good-paying job. But  in the outer reaches of your  network, someone surely has.  Connecting with them will  help you gain the confidence  to take a little more risk. They  might provide that valuable  insight you need to make  that risk a success or offer  other connections to people  who could be helpful. They  might help you recognise an  entrepreneurial opportunity  or new business avenue.  We all need to have both  personal and professional  networks. Both are  important. Both play a critical  role in our success, happiness  and careers. However, it s  your loose tie network that  offers the best potential when  it comes to helping you access  new opportunities.   This is an edited extract from  Stretch: How to Future-Proof  Yourself for Tomorrow s  Workplace, by Karie Willyerd  and Barbara Mistick (Wiley,  February 2016)  Karie Willyerd is   a workplace futurist   for SAP company  SuccessFactors  Barbara Mistick is  president of Wilson  College, Pennsylvania,  and an entrepreneur  populated with family and  friends, people you see often  and people who care for  you deeply. You might think  of those in your personal  network as the people you  know who would be willing  to go the extra mile for you.  You could call them at 3am  and they would answer the  phone. The relationships  used primarily for support  and friendship make up your  personal network.  Many networks that  are primarily personal are  characterised by close ties.  Close or strong ties are  usually defined as family  and friendship relationships,  and are likely to include your  spouse, life partner, close  family members and perhaps  even distant relatives that  you might see frequently.  Other strong ties include  friendships, primarily those  that are non-work-related,   but could include your   closest work friends, friends  from school or your place   of worship. All together,   these groups make up the  close tie component of your  personal network.  Most people also have a  number of  loose tie  or  weak  tie  networks. Perhaps you  are a member of an alumni  association from the college  or university you attended.  Maybe you have a group of  acquaintances or friends  who have moved away, but  with whom you still keep in  touch regularly via holiday  messages or occasional  Facebook comments. Or  you might have an even  looser group of people you  used to work with or have  only met at conferences and  are in your address book or  online social network. (Non- reciprocal relationships don t  count here; following your  favourite actor or comedian s  Twitter feed isn t going to be  helpful to you in this regard.)  These looser collections of  networks   especially the  ones including business   SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K    Behavioural skills Self management and accountability  Using your loaf Before the discovery of the bystander  effect, a similar effect was observed in  the workplace. What was discovered is  a phenomenon commonly referred to as   social loafing . This is where a group of  individuals working on a task together  will personally contribute less effort  than if they were working on their own.   If you witnessed an accident, what  would you do? Would you rush   over to help, administer first aid    to casualties and call the emergency  services? Or would you stand by and  watch, waiting for someone else to get  involved? However much you d like   to think you d be the hero, research  suggests that you re more likely to   do the latter. But why is this?  Leave it to someone else… This behaviour is called the bystander  effect or bystander apathy. It occurs   in particular when we re afraid of    losing face  in front of strangers. In   this situation, it s because we might  assume that there are other people  better qualified to get involved  than we are or that our actions  might be ineffective or, worse still,  counterproductive. In other words,   it s a fear of failure.  It sounds like an irrational fear,  particularly when the consequences of  our not getting involved could be that  someone in trouble doesn t get the help  they need, but it s been observed in  many psychological experiments and   in real-life emergency situations.  This is a subtle effect, first shown in a  simple rope-pulling exercise, in which  individuals exerted less energy pulling  the rope as part of a group than they did  as an individual.   Often, the most common reason   for loafing is feeling that any effort will  not be utilised or recognised, so a sense  of personal responsibility can be critical   to our overall effectiveness in work.  The benefits of being   a responsible person Being more responsible doesn t just  mean that you re a better person   to have around in the event of an  emergency. When you re willing to   take responsibility, you become a   more productive and efficient person.   In the workplace, your efforts to   become more responsible are sure to   get noticed and are likely to help you  climb the career ladder, because you  won t just be doing the minimum  required to pull your weight   you ll   be owning tasks and showing that  you re someone who s got what it   takes to lead others.   Outside work, other people will start  to realise that you re someone they can   DON T BE A  BYSTANDER  OVERCOMING INERTIA AND THE FEAR OF FAILURE IS ALWAYS HARD  WORK. STUART DUFF LOOKS AT SOME OF THE BARRIERS TO TAKING   RESPONSIBILITY AT WORK, AND SUGGESTS SOME REMEDIES    Before you can start to behave more responsibly,  you need to understand what s holding you back  and the steps to take to overcome these blockages  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer April 2016 The Treasurer  47  Stuart Duff is head   of development   at Pearn Kandola   business psychologists  What else might be stopping you? Tying in with the accident scenario, we  may be held back by an assumption that  we don t have the relevant expertise and  that someone else does, for example,  a doctor or police officer. We therefore  convince ourselves that our intervention  is unnecessary or even unwanted.   Another common excuse for not  stepping up to the mark in the workplace  is a lack of time. We frequently perceive  ourselves to be too busy to take  responsibility for a task, although closer  inspection may prove that spending too  much time being unproductive may   in fact be to blame. There is always too  much to do if we don t focus on the most  immediate tasks first. In other words, if  you want to be more effective, prioritise!   Alternatively, we might actually  be willing to take responsibility in a  situation, but we re just not sure how   to convince other people that we are.   Why should I bother? We may also  avoid taking responsibility for a task  because we re simply not interested in  it. If that s the case, here are four simple  actions that can help you deal with this  mental barrier:  1. Understand what motivates  you. Do you know what motivates  your colleagues and how this might  relate to the current situation? We  are all motivated by different things    the opportunity to learn frequently  motivates people more than money,  so looking at what you may achieve  personally through your involvement  may spur you into action. 2. Appreciate the bigger picture. The  task you or others have been avoiding  might seem mundane or unrewarding,  but it could have a far-reaching overall  impact. Recognising how a single issue  or task dovetails into a  bigger picture   can often reignite flagging interest. 3. Utilise the power of the  psychological contract. The  psychological contract is the implicit  understanding and trust between  people engaged in fulfilling objectives  or tasks together, or between those   who give instructions and others who  carry them out. Unlike a legal contract,  it s unwritten and usually unspoken,  yet understood and expected by those  involved. It accounts for the kind of  things we all do (or don t do) in the  workplace and elsewhere, which aren t  detailed in job descriptions, but to which  we psychologically contract as members  of a larger group or organisation. For  example, checking the office building  is secure when you re last to leave is  something you might do, even though  you re not the caretaker; it s a pain to do  and you re already late… 4. Set a great example. If they don t,  why should I? An organisation s ethos   or culture is determined less by its  policies and procedures than by the  behaviour of its employees. It only takes  the example of a single individual to  influence many others.  Draw up an action plan The last step in taking responsibility is  to act. If this prospect still daunts you,  research suggests that planning how you  will achieve your goal will make it much  more likely that you will do so in reality.   In creating a plan of action, consider  the points covered above and decide what  is most relevant to you. Now, identify how  you might apply your plan to a specific  situation and consider, not only about  what you could do, but also what might  deter you. By identifying any potential  problems in advance, you have the  opportunity to think of suitable solutions  to deal with them or, if necessary, to  develop alternative courses of action.   Finally, don t forget to enlist the  support of others. Knowing you have  access to advice will give you confidence  and increase your personal and  professional effectiveness.   rely on, bringing new opportunities to  enrich your life. But before you can start  to behave more responsibly, you need  to understand what s currently holding  you back and the steps you can take to  overcome these blockages.  What stops us taking responsibility?   We ve already seen some of the reasons  for not taking responsibility in the  accident scenario described above,   and that fear of failure can be one   of the biggest considerations that   holds us back. We are conditioned   from an early age to seek approval from  other people. This means that, unless  we re sure that we ll be successful,  we avoid doing things that could risk  drawing criticism.   Conquering the fear of failure So what do we need to do to overcome  this barrier? • Identify what it is that you re afraid   of. By defining it, you re making a start  on challenging it.  • Evaluate. Review the fears you ve  written down and assess whether  they re rational concerns. What s the  worst that could happen if your fear  were to be realised? At this point   you can also exercise some methods  for keeping your fears in check:   writing them down, focusing on   the present moment and thinking  about the successful moments in   your life that you needlessly worried  about beforehand.  • Reinterpret your fears. Peel   back the layers of the fear to find   out what s at the bottom of it,   and where they originate. For   example, are you only afraid because  of something that happened to  someone else?  • Do something about it. Doing  nothing is often counterproductive,  because the longer you do nothing,   the more your fears take root and grow.  Talk to other people, who may help   to put your fears into perspective, and  focus on the positive outcomes from  each of your decisions, no matter how  small. Gain confidence from thinking  about what you ll learn, and from  developing different ways of achieving  what you want to achieve   these are  your back-up plans, and they make  failure less likely.    Business skills Qualifications  48  The Treasurer April 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer   Treasurers need to manage portfolios of borrowings and investments, and evaluate the potential benefits of changing the mix. Deals we need to assess include: (1) Borrowing  (2) Selling investments  (3) Blends of both  Why borrow We might consider borrowing to take advantage of an early- settlement discount. If the value of the discount is more than our  cost of borrowing, this will give a net saving.   Let s explore an example, based on a recent assessment question.1  Discount offer Your company is due to pay a supplier s invoice for £3m in 90 days   time. You have been offered a flat discount of 0.50% to pay 90 days   in advance, today. You do not have enough funds available to make  this payment today. However, you do have sufficient available credit  lines at Libor plus 40 basis points per annum.  Current £ market rate: 90-day Libor 0.60% per annum.  Calculate which of the following choices is the least expensive:  (i) Decline the discount and settle the invoice in 90 days  time. (ii) Accept the discount, funded by borrowing.  Start simple It s usually best to look at the simplest choice first. This provides  a sound base for comparing more complex alternatives. Here, our  simplest choice is to decline the discount, and pay the invoice in full  in 90 days  time. Our future cash outflow will be the full £3m.  Discount saving Alternatively, we can accept the discount of 0.50% (0.005), for paying  early. This discount is  flat , which means the time period is ignored  in the calculation. The discount is: 0.005 x 3,000,000 = £15,000  The discounted invoice amount, payable today, is:   3,000,000   15,000 = £2,985,000  This is the amount we need to borrow for 90 days.  Count the cost The market Libor rate is 0.60% per annum, but we have to pay Libor  plus 40 basis points (0.40%). Our corporate borrowing cost is: 0.60%  + 0.40% = 1% per annum.  Ninety-day £ Libor is quoted as a simple rate, on an ACT/365 fixed  basis. This means borrowing for 90 days will cost 1% x 90 / 365.  The interest charge on borrowing £2,985,000 will be:   2,985,000 x 0.01 x 90 / 365 = £7,360  Is that better? After 90 days, we repay:   2,985,000 + 7,360 = £2,992,360  IN THE  BLEND OPTIMAL CASH MANAGEMENT OFTEN   NEEDS A BLEND OF INGREDIENTS. DOUG  WILLIAMSON SHOWS HOW TO CLARIFY   THE CHOICES AND IMPROVE RESULTS  £ % += CD  000    This is less than the full £3m. Our net saving  is the discount, offset by the interest cost of  funding early settlement:  15,000   7,360 = £7,640  We enjoy a net saving, because the annual equivalent  value of the discount exceeds our annual equivalent cost   of borrowing.  Another ingredient Another cash management choice we might consider is to reduce  our borrowings by selling certain investments. If the interest savings  exceed the investment income given up, we enjoy another net saving.  Let s extend our earlier example to add this ingredient to the mix.  Sell investment, cut borrowings  We have already identified an opportunity to generate net savings  of approximately £7,640 for our company, by borrowing £2,985,000  for 90 days at a rate of 1% per annum.  We also hold a one-year certificate of deposit (CD) investment,  face value £2m, paying 1.25% interest per annum, with 90 days left  to maturity.  Current £ market rate:  90-day CD of a similar credit quality: 0.50% per annum.  Calculate the potential cash flow improvement from selling   the CD to reduce the amount of the borrowing.   Start simpler To calculate the potential benefit, we need to compare our choices.  Again, we start with the simpler one. This is to hold the CD to   its maturity.   The CD repays its face value of £2m at maturity, plus total interest  of 1.25%. Our cash inflow from the CD on day 90 will be:  2,000,000 x 1.0125 = £2,025,000  We d also need to repay the borrowing of £2,985,000, plus   the interest of £7,360 we calculated earlier, a total payment   of £2,992,360.  Time for a table Often, the best way to keep everything clear is to use a table. Our  choices can be column headings. We ll compare (1) borrowing all of the  funds, with (2) selling the CD and borrowing a smaller net amount.  (£000) (1)  Borrow all (2)  Sell CD  Repay borrowing (2,992) ?  CD proceeds 2,025    Net cash outflow  (967) ?  If we sell our CD now, we reduce our borrowing needs, in exchange  for giving up the CD proceeds at maturity. We ve already got several   useful figures, a structure and two question  marks at this stage.  It looks sensible In a table, the ingredients and results start looking   manageable and sensible. We owe £3m, offset by an  asset of about £2m, so our net cash outflow is going to be   around £1m in each case.  Selling the CD The relevant 90-day CD yield is 0.50% (0.005). The sale price today,  discounting the maturity value of £2,025,000, is:  2,025,000 / (1 + (0.005 x 90 / 365) ) = £2,022,506  These proceeds part-fund the discounted invoice amount   of £2,985,000, so now we only need to borrow 2,985,000     2,022,506 = £962,494.  Our interest cost falls to:   962,494 x 0.01 x 90 / 365 = £2,373  Our net cash outflow at day 90 is now simply the repayment   of this smaller borrowing, plus the interest:  962,494 + 2,373 = £964,867  All done Completing our table, we see that choice 2 is the least expensive,   a combination of borrowing and selling the CD.  (£000) (1)  Borrow all (2)  Sell CD  Repay borrowing (2,992) (965)  CD proceeds 2,025    Net cash outflow  (967) (965)  It still makes sense We re best off in this last case, because we save interest at a rate of  1% per annum. This  cost of carry  saving is greater than the 0.50%  per annum investment return that we give up.  The blend was best In this particular scenario, the blended solution had the lowest cash  cost. It won t always, of course. That s why we need to know how to  evaluate our choices with confidence.

The London Stock  Exchange announced recently  that it is considering a merger  of  equals  with its larger  rival, Deutsche Börse. If that  happens, then I, for one, will  lament its passing: I began   my working life in 1982 as   a trainee stockbroker…   As part of my training,  I spent a month as a  blue  button  on the stock exchange  floor. Blue buttons were  unauthorised clerks, so   called because they wore a  button that was blue. The job  of a blue button was to run  around to the various stock   jobbers, who stood by their  hexagonal pitches, and ask  them for the latest prices   on whatever shares the office   upstairs  wanted to enquire  about. It was all terribly  inefficient. It was also quite   a lot of fun.   Obviously, there were   no mobile phones; we used  walkie-talkies to talk to the  office. British Telecom was  still state-owned.

There  was no price competition    brokers were expected to  compete on  service  (for  which read lunch, rugby  tickets, Henley) and the worth  of their share tips.   It was the days when a  fund manager would call his  broker at around 4pm with  an order to deal in 20,000  shares in some stock or other.    Sorry, did you say buy or sell  20,000?” asked a broker once.   Whichever s easier,” came  the reply. The purpose was  simply to give the broker a  trade on which to earn a crust  as a  thank you  for that day s  lunch at The Long Room.

Instead, we had the FT 30    which was a geometric average  of the share prices of 30 large  companies, dating back to  1935. It was calculated every  hour. (Well, why would you  want an index updated every  second?) Goodness knows  why, but it s still published.  The stock exchange  floor was little more than  a ridiculous old-fashioned  men s club. Women were  allowed to enter the stock  exchange in 1973, but by the  time I first walked through  the doors at Throgmorton  Street nine years later, very   few women had chosen to join  the ranks.   Practical jokes and rude  ones were common, though  the whiff of  health and safety   had put an end to the practice  of setting fire to a jobber s  newspaper as he stood  reading the Financial Times.
