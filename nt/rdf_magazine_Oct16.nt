With the pound declining to record lows against trade-weighted averages last month, concerns  are mounting around what the next few years might bring, with more than a handful of corporates  already suggesting profits will be affected. Suddenly, the comfortably far-off effects of exiting the  EU aren t looking quite so comfortably far off.   Currency risks have edged up the agenda, and treasurers will be revisiting hedging arrangements.  Some will have more flexibility than others, but sadly, the global scene offers little in the way of  respite or reassurance. In just a few days, we will learn the outcome of the US election. Forecasters  have been leaning increasingly towards a Clinton win, but the populist element and the profound  sense of polarisation within the electorate of this unusually bile-filled election can t be totally  disregarded. On page 18, commentator Roland Hinterkoerner picks over Donald Trump s   spending intentions and weighs up the implications of an infrastructure spending spree fuelled   by Treasury bonds.   Into this mix, we re seeing the advances of some large-scale transactions. As I write, telecoms  giant AT&T is in talks with Time Warner for what would amount to an $85bn tie-up, while British  American Tobacco aims to buy back into the US tobacco market with a $47bn offer for Reynolds  American, in which it already holds a 42% stake.  The case for tobacco mergers and telecoms-content tie-ups resoundingly made, is the stage set  for a wave of deals across other sectors? Consolidation may prove a decent strategy for shoring up  market presence and spreading risk.  In our profile this month we talk to Rando Bruns, head of group treasury at German life sciences  group Merck, who knows a thing or three about acquisition funding. Merck s purchase of Sigma- Aldrich, finalised in 2015, was a bold move, 100% debt-financed. Bruns explains the mechanics  of the Sigma-Aldrich and other deals on page 20, as well as describing how he managed Merck s  relationship banks over the course of the deal, and the role that treasury can play in post- transaction integration.  On page 24, Sally Percy explores the role that the ACT and treasury professionals have played   on a public stage when they seek to shape and influence regulatory change, and on page 34, we   look also at the opening up of Iran in a post-sanctions era.

Sterling s post-referendum fall   in value halted over the summer  months only to begin again, against  growing political signals that   the UK will execute a  hard exit   from the EU and the single market.  Sterling hit a historic low in early  October against a trade-weighted  basket of currencies. The pound has  dropped by more than 15% against  the euro since the referendum.  Businesses that pay suppliers  with a weakened pound are finding   themselves increasingly   caught by the dilemma.  Sports Direct International, for  instance, reported that the flash  crash in the pound could cause  earnings at the sports retailer to  fall by as much as £35m.  Other businesses affected by  currency movements included  UK-based airline easyJet, which put  the cost of the declining pound at  around £90m for the year ending  16 September. Irish budget airline  Ryanair cut its profit forecast by 5%  ahead of its full-year results, citing  the drop in the pound as the cause.  According to research from  East & Partners, 80% of the UK s   biggest companies put hedges  in place ahead of the June   vote on the UK s EU  membership. Some  22% of SMEs also put  currency protection in   place in the run-up to   the vote.  However, for those companies  with arrangements due to expire,  questions around passing increased  costs onto their customer base   or facing diminishing margins   are heightened.  BRIEFING  06  The Treasurer November 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  { CONTEXT OF TREASURY }  CFOs TURN TO TREASURERS   FOR STRATEGY INPUT  Regulatory compliance,  economic uncertainty and the   interest rate outlook are among   the strategic issues where finance  heads increasingly turn to their  treasury counterparts, according   to a white paper from the  Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).  The study, Managing Risk in  Challenging Economic Times,   which was published last month,  sets out the spectrum of issues   on which CFOs consult treasurers.  Macroeconomic, regulatory and  technological challenges are not  just reshaping treasury s outlook,  it concluded, but they are also  changing the way the treasury  function interacts with the rest   of the organisation.  Compiled from a survey of   150 senior treasurers and 150   CFOs worldwide, the EIU s white  paper confirms that treasury s  partnership with the rest of the  business has strengthened.  Uncertainty about economic  growth is by far the top concern  that treasurers around the world are  dealing with at present, while low    or even negative   interest rates are  triggering significant policy changes  in the area of cash management.  Meanwhile, compliance and  other regulatory matters are taking  their toll on treasury resources, with  respondents saying they already  spend a lot of time on compliance.  Almost 80% expect their  compliance workloads to remain    as high as they are, or even to  increase.  This avalanche of   new regulatory requirements   has spawned a palpable sense   of frustration among many  treasurers,” the report s authors  said,  especially with regulation  that is seen as creating high  burdens without delivering any  tangible benefits.”  In addition,  Several [treasurers]  also worry that the higher  compliance costs, along with  higher capital ratios for financial  institutions, could cause banks to  become more selective.   Regulation is thus not just   seen as a nuisance, but also  as a potential threat to bank  relationships,” they concluded.   There will  be a period  of a couple  of years, or  perhaps even  longer, when  businesses  are uncertain  about the  final state  of our  relationship  with the  EU. During  that period,  we need to  support the  economy to  make sure  that consumer  confidence  remains.” UK chancellor Philip Hammond  (pictured above) signals a  temporary halt to austerity  in an effort to bolster the  economy as the country  prepares for Brexit in 2019. SOURCE: EVENING STANDARD,   3 OCTOBER 2016  SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K  WORDS  { CONTEXT OF TREASURY }  Businesses square up to rising   costs as pound falls to historic low     { CONTEXT OF TREASURY }  UK CFOs remain cautious in the wake of Brexit, survey finds    The latest quarterly survey of UK CFOs from Deloitte has  found that Brexit and economic  risks continue to exercise finance  heads, with investment and  hiring spend expected to decline  over the next year.  In the months since the   UK voted to leave the EU,   equity markets have rallied   and a raft of UK and global  economic indicators have  strengthened. However, CFOs  surveyed by the accountancy  firm said they continued to see  significant risk in the current  business environment.   The animal spirits of the  corporate sector took a battering  in the wake of the referendum  and, three months on, Brexit  continues to loom large for   the UK corporate sector,”   said Ian Stewart, Deloitte s   chief economist.  Brexit-related risks topped the  list of concerns of those surveyed,  with a corresponding impact on  corporate risk taking. Some 18%  of respondents said now was a  good time to take risk onto the  balance sheet, up from 8% in the  survey taken immediate after   the referendum. CFOs who took   part also said they expected to see  their spending on investments and  on hiring decline over the next  three years as a result of Brexit.  CFOs had a continued focus  on cost reduction and better  cash-flow management, with 47%  prioritising reducing costs and  42% putting increased cash flow  as their top concerns. However,  the percentage of CFOs who rate  introducing new products or  services, or expanding into new  markets as a strong priority has  risen from 27% to 39% since the  previous survey was published  just after the referendum.  {  CORPORATE FINANCIAL  MANAGEMENT }  UK rides high  in poll for  inbound M&A  investment  The UK has become the  second most popular country   for inbound M&A activity,  according to a poll from law   firm Allen & Overy.  The UK overtook Switzerland  in the rankings for the third  quarter of this year, as the fall  in the value of the pound made  UK assets more attractive to  international buyers, according  to the survey. Allen & Overy cited  the takeover of Premier Farnell by  US group Avnet Inc as evidence  of the UK s newly strengthened  position, after Avnet outbid Swiss  group Daetwyler.  Overall, though, deal values  have fallen 24% compared with  this time last year. In fact, 2015  saw a record-breaking amount   of large transactions, but all  regions have seen a slowdown   in deal activity this quarter. In   the US, there has been a 32%   fall in transaction values for   Q3 2016 compared with the   same period last year. China   has seen a 26% fall and Western  European deals have contracted  in value by 18%.  The report s authors cited  continued turbulence across the  political and economic climate,  including the long-term effects of  Brexit, an unusually contentious  US presidential race and concerns  around commodity prices and  faltering economic growth in  emerging economies.  { KEY FINDINGS FROM THE DELOITTE CFO SURVEY FOR Q3 2016 }  NUMBERS  71% expect the Bank of England  base rate to remain at or  below 0.25% in a year s time  $152trn   the   size of world debt, which  stands at more than twice   the size of the global economy,  according to the International  Monetary Fund  £285m     the amount of  credit card debt  written off in Q2  2016 in the UK,  according to The  Money Charity  47%   see reducing  costs in their  business as a  strong priority  88%   of respondents  rate the level of  external economic  and financial  uncertainty as  above normal  21,500    the number of Brits  who applied for Irish  passports over the  summer months,  double the number  of applicants for   the same period   the previous year  £250,000   the cash prize offered  by Lord Wolfson, CEO of Next, for the best  suggestion on how to ease congestion on  the UK s overcrowded road network  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer November 2016 The Treasurer  07  42% rate  increasing cash flow  as similarly important  39% also see  introducing new products or  services, or expanding into  new markets as a top priority  100 per week    the number of passenger  flights between the UK  and China, following a deal  between the two countries  aimed at encouraging trade  73%   the tariff  agreed by the EU on  Chinese steel imports  to protect European  manufacturers    08  The Treasurer November 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  { AROUND THE WORLD IN 30 DAYS }  SHENZHEN CONNECT, HOUSE OF LORDS, BRICS Shenzhen and Hong   Kong market tie-up Four of Asia-Pacific s largest  regulators have set the seal  on a stock market tie-up to  boost the flow of stock market  activity between Hong Kong  and Shenzhen, China. Set  for launch later this month,  Shenzhen-Hong Kong  Stock Connect, or Shenzhen  Connect, has been designed to  bridge the territories through  improved mutual market  access, enabling investors   to buy and sell eligible shares  listed in both China and Hong  Kong. The venture builds on  work already established to  bolster market cooperation  between Hong Kong and  China, via Shanghai Connect.   Shenzhen Stock Exchange  chairman Wu Lijun said:   Shenzhen Connect is a major  policy initiative by the Central  Government to promote  reform and opening up in   the capital market.”  House of Lords to   scrutinise Brexit impact The House of Lords  EU  internal market subcommittee   has launched an inquiry into  the implications of Brexit for  the UK s trade in services   with the EU.  The committee has been  hearing evidence from key  service sectors, including  professional business  services, aviation and  telecommunications, as well as  experts on EU law and global  economics, with the aim of  determining the implications  of different levels of market   access the UK might negotiate  with the EU. Key questions  under consideration include  which sectors are most  significant to cross-border  trade with the EU, and what  kind of non-tariff barriers  impact on trade.  The committee has  separately urged that the   UK parliament should be  actively involved in scrutinising  forthcoming negotiations,  rather than after the fact,    as proposed by the   UK government. BRICS leaders bullish Weighing against concerns in  the West around a flight from  globalisation, last month s  BRICS summit reaffirmed  the impact of emerging  economies on the world stage,  commentators argued.  The five heads of state from  Brazil, Russia, India, China and  South Africa met in Goa, India,  for the eighth annual summit  and spoke of the growing  momentum of the group,  while pledging to contribute  to institutions such as the New  Development Bank and the  BRICS Contingent Reserve  Arrangement as a means of  improving financial safeguards.  Roberto Jaguaribe, president  of the Brazilian Trade and  Investment Promotion Agency,  said there were two main  aspects to the group s impact  worldwide: the large number  of developing countries in  their respective region and  the fact that BRICS countries  themselves now represent 25%  of the world s GDP.

According to a statement from the Dubai  Islamic Economy Development Centre  (DIEDC) and pending regulatory approval,  Emirates Trade Bank will offer integrated  trade and commodity-financing solutions.   The bank will help Dubai meet its strategic  goal of supporting the Islamic financial  sector, while integrating investments towards  a doubling of UAE trade flows by 2020.   Sami Al Qamzi, DIEDC vice chairman  and director general of Dubai Department  of Economic Development, said:  The UAE  in general, and Dubai in particular, are   privileged to have a diversified, open and  flexible economy capable of addressing  international and regional challenges.   Emirates Trade Bank is set to reap  synergies from the strategic positioning  and advanced technical and logistics  infrastructure of Dubai, in its efforts to  finance international trade and commodity  flows   particularly through the UAE.”  DIEDC added that it  will continue to  support initiatives aimed at transforming  Dubai into the capital of the Islamic economy.   The UAE and the emirate of Dubai  have always been the leaders and pioneers  in the Islamic finance industry, with the  establishment of the first Islamic bank in   the world in the 1970s.”    China s growth slowdown   prompts deep concerns  While official figures from China  report a GDP of 6.7% for the third  quarter, consistent with the pace  of growth for Q1 and Q2 this year,  cracks in the numbers are beginning  to show, according to reports in   The New York Times and elsewhere.  Some commentators are  characterising the slowdown in  headline growth rates as dramatic,  sufficient to warrant major concern  for central banks, investors and  international corporates. Chief  among their worries is China s  burgeoning debt, which, if its current  pace of growth continues, may bring  China to the brink of a financial  crisis comparable with the global  crisis of 2008, with implications   for the wider economic community.  Controversially, China seems to  be pressing ahead with a scheme to  allow companies to exchange debt  for equity. Corporate debt currently  stands at around $18 trillion. Saudi s first bond issue finds favour In a record amount for an   emerging-market bond debut,  Saudi Arabia raised $17.5bn in   an international issue. The bonds,   which were issued in five-, 10- and  30-year tranches, were greeted with  enthusiastic demand and have been  widely seen as a successful example  of the kingdom s efforts to move  away from an oil-led economy to   a more diverse one.   The bond deal exceeds a $16.5bn  issue in Argentina in April and  comfortably eclipses the $9bn bond  sold in Qatar in May, and proves  that emerging-market debt is very  much in favour. Another notable  feature, according to a report in the  Financial Times, was the fact that  30-year debt proved more popular  than five- or 10-year debt, with   $6.5bn of investors  cash attracted  to the longer-tenor issue. US banks  earnings rally Q3 marked a return in fortunes for  Bank of America, whose net profits  rose to $5bn, its best quarterly  result since 2008. While JPMorgan  Chase and Citigroup saw lower net  profits than Q3 last year ($6.3bn  and $3.8bn respectively), all three  banks reported stronger sales from  bond trading. JPMorgan s results  were helped by record profits in  its commercial banking division, as  well as strong trading activity. The  bank reported an 8% YOY increase  in revenues.  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer November 2016 The Treasurer  09  MAKING  THE   NEWS  { CONTEXT OF TREASURY }  GLOBAL USE  OF RENMINBI  CLIMBS  Global business use of   the Chinese renminbi has   climbed by 7% since 2015, with  nearly a quarter of corporates  now using the currency to do  business with China, according  to figures from HSBC.   Reduced FX risks and costs  has emerged as the primary  motivating force behind   the growth.  However, only around two in  five corporates surveyed by the  bank said they were aware of  opportunities afforded by China s  Belt and Road initiative, with  only 7% of those businesses   that were aware of it working   on a Belt and Road strategy.  Out of the companies  developing strategies to  participate in Belt and Road  opportunities, European  corporates led the way with 12%  of  aware  businesses seeking   an early advantage. North  American firms were next at   9%. In Asia-Pacific, just 6%   of  aware  firms are making  strategic plans involving Belt   and Road opportunities.   Belt and Road projects  are already presenting huge  opportunities for companies  that can help develop physical  infrastructure,” said Noel  Quinn, chief executive of HSBC  Commercial Banking.  But  these are only the first steps. By  boosting connectivity, Belt and  Road will catalyse trade between  more than 65 countries that are  home to nearly two-thirds of  the world s population. For any  company seeking growth and  new customers, that s an exciting  proposition to explore.”  Chinese enterprises invested  $14.8bn on Belt and Road initiatives  last year, on infrastructure  projects that span 49 countries  and cover railway programmes,  logistics hubs and power  generation. China Development  Bank said it plans to contribute  $895bn in project funding.  { CONTEXT OF TREASURY }  HACKERS CLAIM NEW TERRITORY IN SUSTAINED  DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACK  Hackers demonstrated the effectiveness of a new  method of cyberattack last month, disabling   multiple websites when they targeted US domain  name service provider Dyn and rendered key  e-commerce inaccessible for hours at a time.  The cyberattack that targeted Dyn temporarily  silenced key websites, including Twitter, Spotify,  Netflix and news sites for the Financial Times and  The New York Times in a so-called distributed  denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.  Dyn provides a key service to some of the   world s busiest websites, by monitoring and  routing internet traffic. Its servers translate internet  addresses that humans can read and remember   into the IP addresses used by the internet. The   New York Times reported that the attack used   many thousands of internet-enabled devices,   including cameras, baby monitors and home  routers, infecting them with software that then  flooded the service provider with traffic at the  hackers  command.  The first attack hit the service for two hours and  was followed by  a second attack  two hours later.   DDoS   attacks have  risen by   129% YOY,  according to  a report by  Akamai, a  web security  company.    TECHNICAL BRIEFING  10  The Treasurer November 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Noises continue over Brexit: we now have a date for Article 50  notification; the rest of the EU has realised that the impact may   not be as muted, or as benign, as expected. However, the world  awaits elections in the US, France and Germany, with the risk  that the Western economies move away from the macroeconomic  policies prevalent for the past 60 years.  If you have views you d like to share with the ACT policy and  technical team on any subject or have your own submission you   are willing to share, please email us at technical@treasurers.org  The period post the  2008 financial crisis   (FC) has been one of  intense change as  financial services  regulation across the G20  nations will continue to  be rolled out until the end  of 2018 when the Basel III  rules come into full effect.   Corporate treasurers  have been impacted   by these changes, often,   we believe, unfairly  because they were   neither the cause of the  FC, nor revealed any  systemic risk during it.  They have been drawn  into complex reporting  systems and must,  on occasion, provide  collateral   solutions   that are designed to    However, is this about  to go into reverse? The  Brexit referendum  revealed a significant  electorate within the  UK that wants borders  re-established, physically  and economically.  Although Britons have  long been harangued  by their European  neighbours for insisting  on being different,  perhaps they were just   at the front of the train.   The US goes to the polls  this month and whoever  wins may find that  the economically (and  politically) disengaged  have become the majority,  with the resultant shift in  policy that requires. The  far right may win control   in the French election in  2017 and seek the same  physical barriers within  the EU for which Britons  voted. Finally, German  elections are increasingly  putting Chancellor  Merkel s assertion that  Germany could and  should welcome refugees  from outside of the EU  under strain.  The return of  protectionism Back to Brexit, the  principle concern for the  financial services sector is  that financial regulation  may diverge so that not  only passporting, but   also equivalence (see   The Treasurer, October  2016, page 11), may come  under attack.   Divergent financial  regulation may oblige  financial service  providers to fragment  their businesses across  countries with a resultant  increase in cost, not   only of administration,  but also as a result of  tailoring their services   to domestic laws.   This risk may also  apply to the non-financial  sectors as national  governments exhort  their electorates to think  domestically.

Banking capacity to   the real economy  has been reducing  and becoming more  expensive. At the margins,  real-economy employers  risk being classed as  bank-like entities.  The benefit, hard   as it may be at times to  identify, has been that  post-crisis regulation  has a strong bias towards  standardisation and  an extension of the  post-World War II  globalisation that has  been enhanced by the  creation of the EU   and the fall of the   Iron Curtain.  { IN DEPTH }  The end of globalisation?  IK O  N  IM  A G  ES  of moving goods and  services across borders.   Divergent regulation  in the real economy may  result in the production  of different goods for  different countries.  Manufacturers and  service providers will  be faced with the same  conundrum as financial  service providers: whether  to withdraw to the most  populous markets or  fragment their product  range to meet each  market s demands.  For example, Japan  Inc has been vocal in  expressing its concerns  about where all this  change could lead and   in September issued a   15-page report setting  out its Brexit demands.  The UK is not only a  significant market for  Japan, but also a base for  Japanese manufacturers  to export into the rest of  the EU (a larger market).  Any loss of existing  free-trade arrangements  is a key factor in their  business models.  The message from  the real economy to  regulators should be  to hold the line on  globalisation or risk that  their economies suffer  the higher cost of local  production for local  markets, and increased  layers of duties.

Real economy woes:   not  too big to fail   The collapse of Hanjin Shipping  has left cargos blocked at docks  and on the high seas. A passing  comment in a Daily Telegraph  article (www.telegraph.co.uk/  business/2016/09/18/fees- rocket-for-collapsed-cargo- giant-hanjins-clients) highlights  the risk to the real economy  when debt overwhelms a  business that ships goods to  hungry Western consumers,  in a world in which scale has  been associated with efficiency.  Estimates are that 400,000  containers with goods (some  of which are perishable),  belonging to 8,300 owners  were stranded on ships at  docks, sitting outside ports  and on the open sea. The  financial services  sting in the  tail  for importers is whether  their insurance is sufficiently  comprehensive to recover   the costs of late deliveries   or indeed of getting their   goods landed.  { WATCH THIS SPACE }  Professional standards One of the consequences of the  global financial crisis has been   the recognition that it is necessary  to address the behaviours of the  people working in the markets and  that regulation alone is not sufficient.  This has led to the issue of a  number of professional standards   { INTERNATIONAL }  TRADE AGREEMENTS   FOR BLUFFERS   The practicalities of how one separates a country  from a  club  that has formulated its regulation    for 40 years is only now being discussed and it is  important for treasurers to grasp the nature of the  problem that will impact the real economy that   they finance.  Currently, the UK is a member of the EU, which is a  tariff-free area within which goods and services move  across borders without duties. Goods entering the EU  are considered imports only at their initial point of  entry. Clearly something needs to be put in place to  ensure continuity of access to markets following the  conclusion of the two-year Article 50 period in 2019.  Two principle types of possible trade agreement are: 1) World Trade Organization (WTO) treaties. The   160+ members of the WTO have schedules of agreed  duties on goods and services, which take effect where  they do not have bilateral agreements: known as Free  Trade Agreements (FTAs).  2) FTAs are agreed bilaterally. Hugely detailed,  traditionally, these take many years to negotiate  (and often almost as long again to implement). Any  favourable tariff arrangements must be established via  an FTA as the WTO legislates against any preferential  treatment of trading partners through its most- favoured-nation concept.  In theory, it may appear to be  easy  to adopt WTO  treaties, but: a) the UK does not currently have its  own schedules   it operates under the auspices of the  EU schedules.

Neither the EU 27 nor the UK have laid down any  negotiating points yet, but reliance on WTO would  mean that as a  blue sky thinking  example, the UK  could not offer to allow EU food to come in duty-free,  to meet its 40% domestic shortfall in food, in return  for duty-free exports of financial services, without  doing so for all WTO members.  So what about an FTA with the EU? History shows  these can become marathon negotiations spanning  years as each party pushes to optimise the result   for themselves. And within the EU there will be   27 parties doing so.  and guidelines to which bankers are expected to adhere,  in particular the Senior Managers Regime. To date, these  guidelines have not directly impacted on the activities of  corporates, but in May 2017, a global FX code and a sterling  code (the latter covering UK securities lending, repo and  money market code), which together replace the old non- investment products code, will be published. As market  participants, corporates should be aware of these codes.

I was invited to be a part of the set-up of London  Mid-Tier Treasury at PwC; I didn t know much  about treasury, but I saw it as a great opportunity. What do you like about treasury? Treasury is very central and very critical to   a business, and touches upon a vast range    of areas. You can be looking at cash  management structures one day, then the next  be covering pension risk or how Brexit or  The  Donald  may impact business in the future.   I really enjoy the broadness of the role and   the value your insight can bring. What s the best thing about being a treasurer? Being able to really drive change and generate  value for a business. What s the best thing about being a member  of the ACT? The support network. Which ACT qualifications do you hold? For  example, AMCT/MCT/CertITM AMCT How has your qualification benefited you in  your career so far? It has helped ground my understanding of  treasury and is something I can refer back to,   no matter what role I am in.  What would be your best piece of advice   to someone else considering a career   in treasury?  To speak to people both inside and outside of  treasury, people who know you both personally  and professionally and, where possible, arrange  shadowing opportunities to allow you to make  an informed decision.  What s your ultimate career goal?  To inspire and lead a large team. If you weren t a corporate treasurer, what  would you be and why?  It would likely incorporate some form of design  and running my own business.  If you would like to star in our 60-second  interview slot, email editor@treasurers.org.

Students of economic   history will know that the  Great Depression was a two-   or three-stage catastrophe.  The first phase began with   the Wall Street crash of   1929. However, the Great  Depression itself was more the  result of a subsequent banking  crisis. This began in Europe  with the collapse of Austria s  biggest bank, Creditanstalt,   in 1931. The shock waves from  this implosion spread across  the world, resulting in a  cascade of interlinked banking  runs and insolvencies that  ended up overwhelming the  global economy.  Looking at the travails   of Deutsche Bank today, the  parallels are all too obvious.  The first phase of the global  financial crisis began in the  US mortgage market, but then  spread to Europe, and now  seems to be snapping at the  heels of one of its systemically  most important banks.   Yet, despite the apparent  similarities, there are also key  differences. Deutsche is a huge  bank with around €2 trillion  of assets, but it is still easily  within the capacity of the  German government to bail it  out should things deteriorate  further. For political reasons,  German Chancellor Angela  Merkel has insisted there will  be no such intervention, but  in practice there are virtually   no circumstances in which  Deutsche would be allowed   to go bust.  Even so, the situation is  precarious. More worrying  still, it is symptomatic of wider  problems within European  banking as a whole. There are  essentially four big negatives  at work here: US misconduct  fines, zero interest rates,  tougher capital requirements  and the competitive challenge  of fintech.  Having already fined most  of the big US banks over  mortgage mis-selling, the   US Department of Justice has  turned its attention to Europe.  Typically, banks will settle  for a half or less of the sum  originally suggested. It seems  highly unlikely Deutsche Bank  would be forced to pay the full  $14bn regulators are gunning  for. Even so, the fines come  at a particularly vulnerable  moment for the European   banking system, already  struggling to cope with the  collapse in returns brought  about by the low interest  rate environment. Worse, for  some European banks, this is  not where it ends. A number,  including Deutsche Bank,  face further fines for alleged  Russian sanctions busting.  Rightly or wrongly,  European bankers believe   they are being unfairly  penalised. For instance, if  JPMorgan were to be fined   a similar proportion of its  market capitalisation as  Deutsche Bank, the sum  would amount to a jaw- dropping $200bn. The fines  are punishment, some believe,  for the action taking by the  European Commission against  Apple for tax avoidance. A  similar criticism is levelled   at so-called  Basel IV  capital  requirements, which seek to  place an absolute floor on the  amount of capital banks must  hold regardless of the riskiness  of the loan book.  Analysts have crunched  the numbers and concluded   that many European banks  are severely undercapitalised.  It may make sense to impose  the new standards for safety  reasons, but again, they hit  European banks harder than  US counterparts. What s  more, it has become virtually  impossible to raise new capital  in circumstances where it  is seen to be immediately  snaffled by US regulators.  Zero interest rates have  further steepened the  challenge, undermining  margins and, therefore,  traditional business models.   It may be possible to charge  big corporates for deposits,  but it is almost impossible   to do it to individual citizens.  To cap it all comes the  competitive threat of fintech.  Big banks are used to having  it all their own way, but now  there is a growing wave of  entrepreneurial endeavour  promising to eat their lunch,  such as Peter Thiel s N26   in Germany, a mobile   banking app.  History may not be about  to repeat itself exactly, but  eight years after the start of  the financial crisis, Europe s  incumbents remain firmly  stuck in a life or death struggle  for survival.   Do the current travails in the global economy mirror the circumstances   that precipitated the Great Depression, or is it a question of degree?

If targeted  public investments can generate positive  real returns, they ought to be undertaken.  In the US and Europe this could help   to offset the current weakness in private  investment growth. Modestly higher  government debt does not pose a serious  risk in most cases. Governments that  borrow in their own currencies, issued by  their own central banks, need not worry  much about rising borrowing costs from  temporarily higher deficits.   Governments have been slow to  develop policies and programmes    that deal with the undesired effects of  globalisation on the living standards of  low-skilled workers. Real income growth  for the top 10% of earners in Organisation   Are ultra-low interest rates in the  developed world here to stay? Not  necessarily. The slow-growth, low-  inflation environment is in some part a  natural economic phenomenon. Western  populations are getting older; their citizens  demand less credit and more savings   than before; and lower interest rates are  required to balance money markets.   In addition, as developed economies  become ever more sophisticated and  advanced, the degree of incline on the hill  of discovery gets ever steeper. However,  growth is still more sluggish than it ought  to be, and this is self-inflicted.   Economic growth will remain in a low  gear until the leaders of the developed  world take a more balanced approach to  economic policy. After the 2008 Lehman  mega-recession, central banks have been  relied upon to stabilise financial markets,  boost demand and prevent deflation all at  once. Monetary policy can have powerful  effects as it did in the years immediately  after the crisis. But when economies face  structural problems, monetary policy can  only buy time.   Central banks have indeed bought  time, as they continue to, by delving  ever deeper into their policy arsenals,  inventing new weapons when old ones  run out, and doing what was once  unthinkable, setting negative interest  rates in some cases. Alas, the vigorous  growth of the past has proved elusive.  All the while their strained efforts have  created risks and concerns of their own.   Monetary policy can provide an  economy with extra fuel. But it cannot  increase the size of its engine. Economic  growth in the developed world will only  experience a material and sustained  acceleration if monetary policy is  complemented with appropriate   fiscal and supply-side policies.  for Economic Co-operation and  Development countries since the mid- 1980s to the late 2000s was 1.9% per year  compared with 1.3% for the bottom 10%.  Income tax cuts that raise the disposable  income of low earners would likely raise  demand and growth, and would reduce  the attraction of populists, too.  Whereas fiscal policy can generate  demand quickly, gains from supply-side  reform are slow to take effect, but they  have greater benefits in the long term. For  the most part, supply-side reforms involve  scaling back bad government policies of  the past, often involving freeing up labour  markets that have become sclerotic from  excess regulation   think France. Both the  UK under Thatcher and Germany under  Schroder serve as examples of successful  labour market reform. More recent  examples include the likes of Ireland and  Spain, which currently enjoy some of the  fastest growth rates in the eurozone.  Governments in the developed world  have taken their eye off the ball as central  banks have made extraordinary efforts to  support their economies. Labour market  reforms can be politically unpopular.   But sometimes the medicine is bitter.   It is high time governments showed more  courage in reforming their economies.  Where there is fiscal headroom, it should  be used as a temporary sweetener. With a  more balanced policy approach, the world  could begin to look a little more familiar.  If not, the slower growth will become  entrenched, and ultra-low rates will  become permanent.   Central banks have played a reforming economic role.

Follow him  on Twitter   @ColinTyl  SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K   www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer November 2016 The Treasurer  17  This is my last article   for The Treasurer as the  ACT s chief executive. I m   stepping down at Christmas  after five years in the role.   It s been both a pleasure and   a privilege. When I took the   job, I often wondered what it  took to be a successful chief  executive. I still do.   As I prepare to leave,   I thought I d share with   you some of the lessons I ve  learnt in my time both as the  ACT s CEO and more widely  throughout my career. We  have come to refer to these as  my continuing professional  development (CPD) tips, but  very shortly they will merely  become nostalgic ramblings.  My predecessor left me  plenty of tips. Indeed, they  all came with a PG rating.  He encouraged us all at the  ACT to experiment and I am  thrilled that during my tenure  we have. I encourage my  successor to do the same.   Like all professional  bodies, the core route to  success is to remain relevant  to our members and wider  stakeholders. After nearly  30 years as a member, it is  crystal clear to me that the  ACT still has a strong and  continuing reason to exist.  We continue to need fair and  effective financial markets,  where the natural risks that  arise in international trade  can be dealt with. Markets  need to be made and trusted  by all who bring their wares.  For too long the unprepared,  untrained, misinformed or the  misled suffered misfortune.  Fortunately, since inception,   the ACT has been preparing  its members and their real  economy businesses with  means to help build trade.  I m delighted that we still  have many members who were  founders of the ACT back in  1979. Back then, why did the  ACT form? Finance directors  of the FTSE 30 (a phrase not  often used these days) helped  identify and then encourage  the emerging treasury  community to create an  advanced body of knowledge  about corporate treasury     in essence advanced finance  problem-solving.   I ve always wondered  why, at the time, the UK  finance directors didn t try to  convince their then respective  accounting professional  bodies to develop these skills,  given that they are such a  prerequisite for business     as much then as they are now.  In the next decade or so, I  anticipate that accounting and  financial reporting jobs will   become progressively deskilled  as cheaper rules-based  automated finance practices  become the norm. Increasingly,  the accounting profession  is encouraging its members  and students to upskill and  move towards higher strategic  ground. Perhaps one day there  will be an Institute of Advanced  Financial Problem Solving.   If there is, you can be sure  that the ACT and its members  will be at its core. After all, it s  what we already do.  When I joined the ACT   in 1988, it was to access a   body of knowledge that could  help me one day become a  corporate treasurer. It worked  and it s been fun. As I finish  my financial career, sitting in  the City of London, my baker s  dozen of CPD tips are: •  Accept that you don t have   all of the answers, but act,  always, with confidence;  •  Try to spot an answer   when you see one and give   { LEADERSHIP }  COMMENT  COLIN TYLER When all s said and done, addressing today s challenges   comes down to advanced financial problem-solving,   and treasurers are well equipped for that  credit to the author; • Be bold; •  Demonstrate and stick    to your core principles; •  Be consistent, even if    it s painful; •  Pick well (both people    and problems); •  Take risks with people, and   encourage your team to do  the same;  •  Make sure everyone has their  moment in the sunshine;   •  Give your team space to  grow… and they will;  •  Listen actively, but learn  when to ignore advice;  • Accept all offers of help; •  Be humble and remember it   is a privilege to have the best  job; and  •  Remember to pass the  baton before the end of the   exchange zone .  Thank you for all your  support and continuing  support of the ACT.   If there was  an Institute  of Advanced  Financial  Problem  Solving, the  ACT and its  members  would be at   its core    18  The Treasurer November 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  TRUMP  WHO S BUYING?  A Trump win in the US elections is unthinkable   from many perspectives, but that should not prevent   a clear-headed look at the economic ramifications.    Roland Hinterkoerner explores the issue    www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer November 2016 The Treasurer  19  COMMENT  What if Donald Trump managed to  prove the pollsters wrong and won  this unprecedented race for the US   presidency? While this has been an out- of-the-money option since the primaries,  and despite scandal after scandal haunting  his campaign, the man cannot be counted  out easily. That gruelling thought is  growing on more and more people, and  some of the pundits have run through  their strategy framework of how markets  might be affected.   But are markets really prepared for  what s to potentially come in the first  place? I doubt it. There are a few public  voices, such as fund manager Jeff  Gundlach, the man who dethroned   Bill Gross as the world s bond king. He   is pretty convinced that Trump will make  it, and his view is that this would not   be a bad thing at all. On the contrary, he  thinks a President Trump would be good  for the US economy, at least initially.   Gundlach may not be wrong. Donald  Trump s lingo on the economy doesn t only  include the obvious scare about future  trade policies. It has touched on a number  of viable points, such as lowering taxes for  businesses, spending on infrastructure  and cutting red tape. If done sensibly, this  part of his policy cocktail could have an  at least short- to medium-term positive  effect on the economy, the unemployment  rate and inflation.   Markets haven t thought much beyond  what kind of trade wars with the likes  of Mexico, China and Japan he might  instigate. But they should. While the holy  grail in economic forecasting appears to  be a Hillary Clinton win and more of the  same economically, they would do better  to think again. Clinton would have to cater  to the millions of Bernie Sanders disciples  and adopt lots of ideas he was advocating  during the campaign. Taxes would have to  be hiked, and red tape would be on the rise.   Let s think through what the Donald  could achieve, if done properly. Lowering  taxes significantly, as he proposes, would  surely provide a bit of a Reaganesque  renaissance and a respective boost,  much like we saw in the 1980s. America  needs to encourage existing and would- be entrepreneurs, as history has shown  sustainable job gains are predominantly  feasible in the area of SMEs.   Infrastructure spending would be key  to the quick successes that Trump would  depend on to get his feet on the ground  in the White House. It is desperately  needed across the nation, and if he doesn t  take the plunge, who will? The entire  world, maybe with the lone exception   of Germany, is on course of expanding  investment in infrastructure. Young Justin  Trudeau across the border could be a good  example of initiative in this field.   Benefits for the economy, labour  markets and even inflation should be fairly  imminent. The first question, however,  is one of the durability of such effects. A  massive boost in investment will not be  sustainable over the medium to long run,  and unless the entire economy catches on  to it, the positive effects may deflagrate  sooner rather than later. A subsequent  pullback from the final rearing up of  government and central bank stimulus  could be even harsher.   The second question will be one of how  to pay for all this spending. Coupled with  tax cuts, federal and state budgets would  come under enormous strain and deficits  would be poised to rise significantly.  Trusting that Trump was not serious   about restructuring America s liabilities  any time soon, the nation s debt would  soon surpass the 20 trillion mark and a  swathe of new Treasury bonds would be  issued to raise the funds.   The third question then is the structure  of this fundraising. Who would finance  what would amount to a humongous  spending bill of a Trump presidency in  the first place? Contrary to the concerns  some of the pundits may have, it should  not be a problem, as bond investors will  eventually not shy away from America s  ever-increasing debt mountain, but rather  see the logic in raising money for the  country s crumbling infrastructure.   Purchasing infrastructure Unless there was even another way…  Canada, for example, is choosing to  rely on its central bank to support new  government debt that is earmarked for  its infrastructure. Were the US to go  down the same path, it would constitute  a reopening of the Federal Reserve s  quantitative easing programme in some  shape or form. A central bank purchasing  infrastructure debt directly isn t exactly   a new concept, but it would certainly lead  to a widespread debate in the US.   If the undertaking were to be financed in  the public bond markets, the wave of new  supply would have to be digested and likely  leave a dent in the Treasury market, albeit  on a temporary basis only. So, in case of a  Trump win, it might be recommendable to  remain invested in the stock market, but  stay clear of bonds, particularly longer- dated treasuries. Ten-year yields could  potentially push up markedly beyond 2%  in the ensuing months.   However, post such a market correction,  investors should be ready to engage in   the Treasury market again. Not much   of a private sector follow-on in economic  demand is to be expected from an  infrastructure stimulus, and the world s  hunger for yield is structural and will  even surpass a Trump presidency. The  time when investors will hesitate to have  exposure to the Treasury market is quite   a long way off still.   An envisaged correction in bond prices  will make it even easier for investors to  buy more of them. As we should all be  aware by now, we live in an era when we  cannot rely on cyclical economic patterns  any longer, not even if those patterns were  being helped by extraordinary spending.  Rather, it is a structural shift driven by  demographics, lack of credit demand   and a disinflationary trend that we are  dealing with.   Against that background, not even  Donald Trump will be able to hold the  fortress for very long. He would try to  shape his legacy as a pragmatic doer right  from the start   but only to go down   in history as a tragic figure, as someone  who had interesting intentions and set  out to do right by his constituency, but  who ended up doing terrible things and  eventually bringing the whole house of  cards down.   He may denounce the debt mountain  his predecessors have built up, but end  up presiding over pushing it even higher  into more unsustainable levels. He may  genuinely want to protect American jobs,  but end up alienating the rest of the world  and starting trade wars that are to no  one s benefit. He may think acting as the  first isolationist US president in modern  times furthers America s cause, but end up  stirring up a new sort of multipolar world  that might have dangerous consequences.   In historian Niall Ferguson s words,  Trump represents a choice between  the status quo and change, or more  specifically SNAFU (situation normal all  fouled up) and FUBAR (fouled up beyond  all recognition).

From a young age, I wanted to  work with money; I wanted to work in a  bank,” he says.  It was less about wanting  to be a policeman or a fireman for me.”  Bruns took the swiftest route available,  leaving school for an apprenticeship  at Oldenburgische Landesbank in  Westerstede, Germany. He embarked   on a BA in European Finance and  Accounting, studied jointly in the UK  and Germany in 1991, and enrolled on an  MBA as a Fulbright Scholar at Kent State  University in the US in 1995, and came to  realise that he wanted to explore finance  from the corporate side.  Bruns joined General Motors  Opel,   in Rüsselsheim, as a financial analyst and  then became team leader in treasury. After  three years, he moved to Elexis, a specialist  machining company where he was head of  finance and investor relations. Two years  later, he moved to a Munich subsidiary  where he was general finance manager. It  proved to be a testing environment, with  orders falling sharply post September 11.   It was very tough,” he says.  We didn t  know if the company would make it. One  of my first jobs was to lay off 15% of the  workforce, which was one of the toughest  days in my career. Money was short and  every week I had to call the vendors to  negotiate how much we could pay.”  The company returned to profit, but by  2005, Bruns wanted to bring to an end his   weekly commute to and from his home  in Frankfurt. He joined Merck as head of  cash and risk management, and became  group treasurer in 2008.  It was the beginning of a period of  significant change for the company.  Merck s treasury employed only eight  individuals at the time. Today, it stands  at 40 and encompasses insurance  management and pension asset  management for the group, as well as  acquisition financing. Merck s growth  story was just about to begin. Treasury  and Bruns would play a pivotal role.  Family involvement Merck s structure is unusual in that it  is public and private at the same time.  Thirty per cent of the shares are held by  the public, while the Merck family retains  a 70% holding. This gives it a considerable  personal stake and liability, but affords  the company a certain flexibility. While  quarterly results are important for investor  relations, the family is also committed  to handing its heritage on to the next  generation. Furthermore, the family is  personally liable, which also applies to   the board of external managers.   With the family there, you can be  very fast moving. They are not actively  steering the company   that is done by the  board, but they are involved in strategic  decision-making. If you need some sort  of permission, this can be reached within  hours, if need be.”  With nearly 350 years of heritage,  Merck is a business of long-stayers. Very   few trainees leave the company, which has  also grown significantly by acquisition.   We have bought businesses for more  than €30bn and sold businesses for more  than €8bn. So there has been a change in  culture over the past 10 years.”  Most of Merck s acquisitions have  been US and Asian businesses, and have  cumulatively made the company more  internationally focused.  We deal with   66 countries on a day-to-day basis. We try  to make the workforce international and  diverse,” says Bruns.  The starting transaction was the 2006  deal to buy Swiss biotech company  Serono, a €10bn, biotech-pharma link  that was very important strategically. The  2010 purchase of Millipore for $7.2bn in  particular expanded Merck s life sciences  interests, and the $2.6bn acquisition of  AZ Electronic Materials, listed in the UK,  but with main businesses across Asia, also  broadened Merck s footprint.   The completion of Merck s purchase  of Sigma-Aldrich last year was significant  for group treasury. In contrast to the  Serono deal, where the family diluted its  shareholding slightly in the interests of  raising public funds, the Sigma-Aldrich  acquisition, all $17bn of it, was cash and  debt financed. The role that Merck s  treasury team played bringing the  transaction about and managing its banks  brought accolades, including European  Treasury Team of the Year in The Treasurer s  Deals of the Year Awards last year.  The acquisition financing was at   the time the largest in Europe since the    A JOB   WELL  DONE     www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer November 2016 The Treasurer  21  Making the operation   more efficient, negotiating  successive rounds of  acquisition funding and  seeing people grow in  their profession bring  Rando Bruns, head of  group treasury at Merck,  considerable satisfaction  Words: Liz Loxton / Photography: Louise Haywood-Schiefer    22  The Treasurer November 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  RANDO S TOP TIPS   FOR SUCCESS  1   Think about what you can bring to the table to move the  company forward as well as to improve the life of your colleagues  in different functions of the organisation. Have a holistic view of   the company and do not be only treasury-focused.” 2   You do not learn treasury at university; it s learning by doing. The  professional qualifications, like those from the ACT, help, but they   are mostly for people who are already in the profession. I have  made very good experience with our own specialised two-year   treasury trainee programme as a starting point.”  3   What I like about the ACT is that it has built a platform for  networking and communication. It s more international than any  other treasury organisation, so for me it s an opportunity to meet  treasurers and peers from the UK and other countries. Networking   is very important in today s world.” 4   For me personally, the secret to career success is that I am in  a profession that truly matches my personal interests. I enjoy   building a team with which high goals can be achieved. It is also  a pleasure for me to develop, challenge and assist colleagues in   their professional growth.”   What I like about the ACT is that it has built   a platform for networking and communication” in line. The feedback he received was that,  although this approach had been difficult  to swallow at the beginning, it had been  easy for bankers to sell internally, because  Merck was transparent and as good as its  word on outcomes.  We want banks that  want a long-term relationship and while  you are tough on pricing, you have to be  fair, so this worked really well,” he says.  The FX management of the transaction  is also an area he is proud of. Being  involved in the strategic discussions,  Bruns understood that Merck would  soon be in the market for an acquisition  using dollars rather than euros, so two  years prior to the Sigma deal, he began  discussions on setting up a funding  vehicle that reported in US dollars. Merck  established an in-house bank in the US  to accumulate currency, increasing equity  and converting euros into dollars.   That was the first step. If the  acquisition hadn t happened, that  wouldn t matter; we just had US dollar  cash in a US dollar entity, which we could  live with for a certain period of time.”  At that time the US dollar was well  above $1.30 to the euro and Bruns  view   financial crisis. A $15.6bn dual-currency  loan facility was secured in September  2014 and was followed by a €1.5bn hybrid  bond in December 2014 and a $4bn US  bond in March 2015.   The debt market plays a very important  role for us and, therefore, treasury  financing plays a very important role,”  explains Bruns. Treasury was involved in  strategic decisions at a very early stage,  leading discussions on the affordability of  the deal and the implications for ratings.  Banks and their role One of Bruns  ambitions for the financing  was to strengthen relationships with  Merck s 19 banks, but the direction he  decided on was a singular one. Rather  than allowing banks free rein to call   team members and pitch for a stake in  the Sigma-Aldrich transaction, Merck ran  the show from the off.  Every relationship  bank wants a piece of the cake and we  were very strict on this. We had a strategy  as to which bank we d have, which  position and what earnings, and there   was no room for discussion.”   Once the deal was public knowledge,  Bruns made it clear that banks ignoring  the  no calls  rule might end up on a  black list. In return, he offered fair and  transparent treatment. Every bank fell    was that the euro would weaken and the  dollar become stronger.  There was a point  when we had an agreement [to purchase  Sigma], which was friendly. We had an  agreement on price and on some other  aspects of the deal already. But we would  need to finalise on technical areas. And  at that point we could see the USD/EUR  exchange rate moving further down and we  said  we have to do something; we will lose   a lot of money if we don t .    We were hedging our remaining US  dollar exposure at that point. As we had  already considerable US dollar cash available  and already decided to do some US dollar  funding, we went out into the market and  bought plain vanilla USD/EUR options for  our remaining FX exposure of $10bn   and  we did so with the expectation we would   sign within the next few weeks, at which  point we would sell the option and go  straight into a forward.”  Merck did not take the cheapest option,  however.  We bought a one-year option  because we wanted to lose as little in option  time value as possible, to look for an efficient  way. So we spent €100m on option premiums.  This is quite some investment.

Three weeks  later, we sold it for €200m, so the strategy  paid off. Then we moved into the forward  and managed this towards the end.  Overall, we applied a hedging strategy  according to the deal probability   and  we did this very consciously. The overall  benefit was more than €2.1bn. Our average  hedging rate was above $1.30.” When  Merck completed the acquisition a year  later, the dollar had indeed strengthened  substantially; by then the rate was close  to $1.10.  Post-deal integration With considerable deal experience,   Merck has been able to hone its post- transaction approach. Bruns understands  the importance of grasping the nettle  early. Once the deal is signed, the  company begins negotiations with anti- trust lawyers on the scope of discussions  with the other company s treasury  function. Many companies begin the  integration process once the deal is   closed or shortly after.  We have a different  approach; we want to be done on the  day of closing,” says Bruns.  We sit with  the anti-trust lawyers of both parties in  order to prepare integration very early and  say: we will talk about treasury; we don t  talk about customers, products, prices,  vendors   nothing that would give us a  competitive advantage if the deal doesn t  go through.”   Bruns also believes in early discussions  with IT to ensure both parties connect  successfully on completion and early  involvement of the bank in order to be  ready for day one.  Cash pooling should  go live with closing. In order to achieve   this you need to set up bank accounts  for [businesses that are] not already in  your group. You maybe want to make  penny payments and start testing, which  is difficult for them and you typically get  rebuffed, two or three times, but I can tell  you it s feasible,” he says.  Looking ahead Facilitating Merck s growth has to  coexist with the day-to-day tasks, of  course   such as managing FX risk and  keeping a watchful eye on governance  issues. The team is also implementing a  completely wide-ranging new IT set-up for  treasury, triggered by Siemens, which is  withdrawing its cash management system  finavigate from the market.   Similarly, regulatory issues must be  faced up to   Section 365 regulation in  the US, the Money Laundering Act, the  Financial Transaction Tax.   Risk management and political risks  are more open questions. Merck hedged  against falls in sterling ahead of the Brexit  vote, but with most of its business outside  of the euro, the weaker pound and weaker  euro have been unproblematic. It s the  wider implications of the EU that will  exercise Merck.  Overall, we ve benefited  from the FX exposure. I think, as a  company, this might impact us in terms   of regulation. What will it mean when you  want to license a product, for instance?”  The outcome of the US election and  wider political risk are harder to call,  however.  It s another loose bullet,” he  says.  In risk management you discuss  what could be and what is the next   maybe . The big things, you don t see.  The shark that bites you comes from  underneath. We have a very bumpy and  volatile road ahead of us, I m sure of that.”  Team spirit In the meantime, the team s capabilities  and role in Merck s development bring  him a great deal of satisfaction.  Firstly,  enabling the growth of the company     to support this and to help the business  with efficient processes   that s where the  satisfaction lies. Secondly, the teamwork:   I think we re as good as we are because  we re a very good team. Each individual  in the team is there when they are needed  and goes beyond their tasks by going the  extra mile, as well as working jointly with  and for each other. We re a diverse team.  You need a completely different skill set  for all the different tasks   and that makes  us rich, I would say.”   VITAL STATISTICS 1668   year of foundation   50,000  employees worldwide  €12.8bn  revenues in 2015  66  number of countries in   which Merck operates  €1.7bn  R&D spend in 2015    Influencing and advocacy work has   been one of the ACT s priorities since   the founding of the professional body    in 1979. Throughout the decades, its aim has  remained the same: to ensure the voice of the   real economy  is heard in discussions around  financial policies and regulations.   One of the ACT s earliest successes was  persuading the government to establish a  sterling commercial paper market in the  1980s. In more recent years, it has been  active in influencing policy in a range  of areas, including base erosion and  profit shifting (BEPS), Basel III, the  European Market Infrastructure  Regulation (EMIR), the Fair and  Effective Markets Review, the  Wheatley Review of Libor,  money market fund (MMF)  regulation, payment  processes and the  proposed bank ring  fencing arrangements.   This level of  activity is only  possible because   the ACT s policy and technical team  constantly monitors the external  environment and the media to find out  which regulatory developments in the   UK and EU may impact on treasurers.  The task has become considerably more  challenging since a wave of regulation  swept over the financial services sector in  the wake of the financial crisis. As a result,  the ACT has often found itself confined to  a firefighting role.    Because of the pressure of regulation post  2008, we ve tended to be reactive,” explains  Stephen Baseby, associate policy and technical  director at the ACT.  Now we re trying to get  into the debate as soon as an issue arises.”  Taking Brexit as an example, he adds:  We  know politicians are working out what they  want to do. So we want to talk to them now.”  Pleasing most people most of the time As a membership organisation, the ACT   acts on behalf of its membership. So   it needs input and support from    its members if it is to succeed   in influencing any debate.   Of course, it s not always  appropriate for every treasurer    to comment on every topic.  While the impact of the    Basel III framework on bank  capital and liquidity ratios   may affect all treasuries  to some degree, a   consultation by the  UK Payment Systems   Regulator may only  be of interest to treasuries that handle  substantial numbers of payments and  receipts.  We have to be quite specific each  time as to who we are trying to influence  and which part of our membership we are  representing,” says Baseby.  Treasurers are very busy people who have  a lot on their plates, so why is it important  that they spend time trying to influence  policy?  No one else is going to think about  how regulation is going to affect treasurers   24  The Treasurer November 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  The torrent of regulation since the financial crisis has spurred  more treasurers on to become advocates for their profession.   Sally Percy finds out what they do and how they do it  SPHERE OF  INFLUENCE     www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer November 2016 The Treasurer  25   INSIGHT    REFLECTING TREASURERS  VIEWS The ACT consults its policy and technical committee  as to which regulatory areas should be a strategic  priority. This committee includes ACT members   as well as consultants, lawyers and tax specialists.  It also has a treasurers  forum, which is a group   of more than 100 treasurers from organisations of   different sizes, who have agreed to answer email  questions. The ACT may invite treasurers from this  group to go to private meetings with the Bank of  England or another regulator for discussions on   a particular subject.  When it is responding to a consultation, the   ACT will come up with a view based on the   opinions of its members who are affected by   a particular development. In its response, it will   look to demonstrate how a particular policy will  impact on the economy more broadly, not just   on large corporates.  from the point of view of treasurers,  particularly when the impact is indirect,”  observes John Grout, who served as the ACT s  policy and technical director between 2002  and 2015.   The case for a treasurer to get involved  in influencing is a strong one, argues  James Harvey, assistant treasurer at engine  manufacturer Rolls-Royce.  A huge amount  of financial regulation impacts corporate  treasuries. Most of it is well intentioned,  but it can have unintended   or intended    consequences. It is important that corporates  express their views as early as possible in the  development of the regulation so that they  can be considered before it s too late and  positions become ingrained.”  One regulatory development that  particularly galvanised the treasury  community was the adoption of EMIR in 2012.  In addition to new reporting and clearing  requirements, EMIR originally required  corporates, as well as financial services  companies, to post collateral  against their derivative  positions. Thanks to  lobbying by the ACT   and others, this  requirement was later  dropped for most non- financial corporates.   John Jackson, group  treasurer at utility  company Severn Trent,  helped the ACT with its  advocacy work on EMIR while  he was working for his previous  employer, engineering company  The Weir Group.  The Weir Group had very  sizeable FX requirements,” explains Jackson.   And the initial EMIR proposals would have  had a very significant impact on our ability  to enter into derivatives contracts. We would  have had to put a significant lump of cash  behind our derivatives, which would have had a  liquidity impact and could have led to sizeable  risk if there were significant market moves that  meant more cash being called. We managed to  get that requirement pushed back.”  Stronger together Since many regulatory  initiatives are global, a  UK voice, however loud,  is inevitably only one  of many voices being  heard or not heard. So  the ACT combats this  challenge by joining  forces with other  treasury associations.  For many years, it has  worked closely with the  European Association  of Corporate Treasurers  (EACT) to influence  European legislation  and it has a constructive  relationship with the  National Association   of Corporate Treasurers  (NACT) in the US.   The ACT also links  up with non-treasury professional   bodies and trade associations.  It worked with the Chartered   Institute of Taxation on  BEPS and it also liaises  with the Confederation of  British Industry on issues  of mutual concern. On  certain topics, it may find  some natural alignment   with financial services trade  organisations, which tend to   be well financed and influential.   Banks understand the importance   of lobbying and use their trade  associations at every opportunity,” says Sarah  Boyce, associate policy and technical director  at the ACT.  Harvey emphasises how treasurers can work  with peers from across Europe to present a  common corporate front to regulators.  We  work with the ACT, EACT and a number of  other large corporates from around Europe   to try and ensure that corporates have a voice,”  he explains.    This generally involves analysing the   text of developing pieces of regulation to   try and spot areas of concern, discussing   these issues to develop a common  understanding of the problem, responding  to consultation processes and raising our  concerns with the relevant parties. If you ve  got a large group of corporates from across  Europe saying the same thing, then your  arguments, statements and positions have   a lot more weight.”    No one else is going  to think about how  regulation is going   to affect treasurers    from the point of   view of treasurers”    26  The Treasurer November 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Treasurers can work with   peers from across Europe  to present a common  corporate front to regulators  The need for corporates to  put forward a united front is  particularly important in Europe.  This is because the EU tends to take  a consumer-oriented approach when  drawing up legislation.  You have to  turn everything round to their level of  thinking,” says Baseby.  You have to say,    Your consumers are paying this and   that. This is how we change that. ”    UK legislators, on the other hand,  are more inclined to take a broader  view of an issue and have more  sympathy for corporates.  While the ACT will remain a  member of the EACT, Brexit will  potentially weaken the ACT s  influence in Europe.  We will  be more able to influence UK   legislation and less able to make  ourselves heard on the world stage,”   says Baseby.  Advocacy across the pond In the US, the NACT has been active in  influencing policy and its chairman, Tom  Deas, has personally testified to Congress  several times. By connecting with other like- minded business advocacy organisations  through the Coalition for Derivatives End  Users, the NACT has scored two notable  victories with regard to the Dodd-Frank  Act. The first was getting corporate end  users exempted from having to post cash to  margin for the daily mark-to-market of their  derivative positions. The second was securing  an exemption from clearing requirements for  corporate swap end users  treasury centres.  The battle against excessive regulation  continues, however. Currently, the NACT  is opposing new actions by US banking  regulators that require banks to hold higher  capital for derivatives trades with end users.  Deas says the proposals  negate the benefits  of the exemption from margining, since they  have the same economic effect as if the end  user had to post margin and increase the cost  of doing the trade”.  Treasurers are also getting headaches from  additional regulations affecting US money  market mutual funds.  Particularly onerous   is the requirement  being implemented   that prime funds,  investing in non-  government securities,  post a daily variable net   asset value instead of a fixed  net asset value,” explains Deas.    This is causing treasurers major  problems because they have to   modify their treasury systems to  keep track of gains and losses on    each redemption for tax compliance.”   Definition of success While the ACT can boast many successes   in its advocacy work, it s not always allowed  to talk about them.  I can t tell you most of  the policy successes because they re things  we headed off, which didn t happen,” says  Grout.  But I can tell you that treasurers  would be much less happy.” He does, however,  cite the foundation of the UK commercial  paper market, the amends to the 1986  Financial Services Act, the introduction of  UK withholding tax rules for privately placed  bonds, work done during the financial crisis,  the Libor review and EMIR as examples of the  ACT s success.   Very rarely does the ACT set out to overturn  government policy on something because we  would never succeed in that,” he explains,  but  very often we nudged them away from things  that were really terrible and had to settle for  things that were simply unacceptable.”    We would probably say that the greatest  success has been the outcome, so far, of EMIR,”  says Baseby,  and the fact that we persisted  with arguments against dual-sided reporting,  which are beginning to have some effect.”  Another important win is how advocacy  work has helped to raise the profile of treasury  both within the regulatory and the business  communities.  The Bank of England will  phone us up and ask us about things,” says  Boyce.  We ve worked hard to make sure they  see us as a resource.”  Harvey confirms that regulation ranks  highly on Rolls-Royce s strategic agenda.   It s been discussed at board level,” he says.   It s definitely on the CFO s list of key things  we need to keep on top of. From a treasury  perspective, it s been one of the priorities  since 2009.”  Acknowledging the achievements of  the ACT, Deas remarks:  The ACT is very  dedicated to the treasury profession and   it has a staff of very knowledgeable people.  It has the resources and capacity to speak      www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer November 2016 The Treasurer  27   INSIGHT  WHAT TO DO IF YOU WANT TO INFLUENCE •  Express your interest to the ACT s policy and technical   team via Stephen Baseby (sbaseby@treasurers.org)  and Sarah Boyce (sboyce@treasurers.org).  •  Read widely and use social media to follow key  journalists.

We very  much value the NACT s close working  relationship with the ACT.”  Future challenges Keeping on top of regulation is  an ongoing battle that won t be  made any easier by Brexit. As  Baseby points out, Brexit will  require the UK to rewrite  every trade agreement it has  with different countries,  with the result that new  import duties could  affect supplies of  raw materials and  increase the cost of  doing business.  He also predicts that there could be   a divergence of regulation  along interventionist,  protectionist lines   in  contrast to the convergence  of regulation that has  marked the past few  decades.  The risk is that  regulation could become  more of a distraction to  business and affect the real  economy,” he notes.  Boyce highlights that the  rise of protectionism in   Brexit will require the UK to rewrite  every trade agreement it has with  different countries, with the result  that new import duties could  increase the cost of doing business  Sally Percy is a  business and finance  journalist and   former editor of   The Treasurer  the US and China presents risks, along with  the global low interest rate economy and   volatility seen in both the commodities and  FX markets.   Treasurers, meanwhile, have their own  concerns. Harvey will be keeping an   eye on the European Commission s  upcoming review of EMIR, as well   as further amendments to the  Basel capital rules, the Global FX   Code of Conduct and changes  to MMF regulation.

During this time, the bursary  scheme has helped more  than 50 students complete  an ACT qualification.

The rationale for this is  that if we support students  in building their professional  competency, this, in turn,  helps their employers work  more efficiently, effectively  and ethically. This then  positively impacts the  regions and economies in   which they operate, the goal  being that both capacity and  capability grow in treasury  against globally recognised  competency standards.  For the students   themselves, completing   an ACT qualification often   has a significant impact   on their career, giving       www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer November 2016 The Treasurer  29  ACT EDUCATIONAL TRUST  them the confidence   to take on additional  responsibilities within   their roles, the knowledge  to make improvements to  treasury processes within  their organisations, or  opening doors to new  employment opportunities.   Since the launch of   the new ACT qualification  structure in 2015, we   have seen consistent   and impressive results   from our students    studying under the bursary  scheme, with a 100% pass   rate at the Certificate in  Treasury Fundamentals   level. On top of that, 86%   of these students are going   on to study the higher-   level Certificate in   Treasury qualification.   The ACT Educational Trust  relies solely on charitable  donations. With your help,  we can continue to support  individuals throughout the   developing world who wish  to forge a career within  treasury. We therefore ask  you to consider making   a donation, however large   or small, via the online  donation form on our  website: www.treasurers. org/acteducationaltrust/ donationform  The Trust is also always keen  to hear from people who are  interested in joining the  board as a Trustee.

BURSARY BENEFICIARIES  Chikondano Chisala,  senior treasury dealer,  NBS Bank, Malawi Chisala was one of the  first students to complete  CertTF under the bursary  scheme. Having achieved   a distinction, Chisala is now studying  towards the CertT qualification. She was  selected as one of the ACT s 2016  Ones to  Watch , a group of 16 treasury professionals  who we see as tomorrow s treasury leaders.    I joined NBS Bank as a management  trainee and first came across the treasury  world during one of my rotations,” she says.  Chisala applied for the ACT bursary  scheme to study CertTF with the hope   of gaining global expertise in treasury   and working towards ACT accreditation.    I found CertTF to be relevant to me as   a treasury professional working in a  developing country, particularly with  regard to understanding advanced risk- management tools to manage financial,  business and operational risks that are  very common in developing countries.   Studying with the ACT opened many  doors for me. I was promoted to senior  treasury dealer. Last year, I was the lead  representative from treasury on a project  team to upgrade core banking systems,  working on the swaps and forward  contract modules. I find the involvement  with international markets exciting.”  She continues:  The CertTF and CertT  courses are rich, well structured, practical  and they have equipped me with tools to  apply in my day-to-day operations as well  as provided me with a good foundation   to support my future career aspirations.”  Wisdom Akakpo, dealer,  Barclays Bank, Ghana Akakpo is one of two  students who have now  completed both CertTF  and CertT under the  scheme, achieving a   distinction for CertTF and impressively  completing all five CertT units in one  sitting. He is now planning to apply for a  bursary to study the DipTM qualification.   CertT deepened my understanding of  cash and liquidity management, corporate  finance and risk management markets,  among others. The course has helped   me improve in my liquidity and risk  management roles,” says Akakpo.  The  online Learning Academy was of great  use as I could interact with other students  and tutors, and seek clarifications on any  readings. The ACT team was very helpful  and available to clarify and resolve any  questions I had. I am humbled at the  team s dedication to see me succeed.”  One of his career objectives is to  become a well-equipped, world-class  global markets professional.  The ACT  qualifications are comprehensive and  internationally respected. The ACT  Charter will broaden my knowledge in  financial markets, sharpen my practical  finance skills, improve my marketability  globally, and prepare me as an agent of  change in Ghana. Via the ACT mentoring  service, I have access to a network of ACT  Charter holders for mentorship.”  He concludes:  Studying for CertTF and  CertT was a great experience. Personally,   I have never felt more equipped to  become a world-class corporate treasurer.”     Marcell Molnar, relationship manager, Deutsche Bank, HungaryMolnar was the winner of the 2015 Gay Pierpoint Award, in recognition of being the  highest-scoring CertTF student studying  under the bursary scheme. He went on   to study CertT, passing all five units in one  sitting with either a merit or a distinction.  He is currently studying towards DipTM  with the support of the bursary.  Molnar says he began studying  corporate treasury in an effort to better  understand his clients.  While the ACT  exams were challenging at times, the  study material is up to date and crystal  clear. As everything is available online,   it was really easy to access anything   I needed, including communicating with   a personal tutor, access to the student  forum and downloadable extra reading.   It was a real honour winning the Gay  Pierpoint Award, and actually took a few  days to sink in. I am grateful for the bursary  as it enabled me to complete these  fantastic courses. The bursary application  process was straightforward and I felt very  supported throughout my studies. Most  importantly, I was able to instantly apply  what I learnt in my daily role.”  Molnar s manager, Katalin Tornyai, head  of global network banking for Hungary   at Deutsche Bank, says:  Marcell s  commitment to his ACT studies and his  excellent exam results demonstrate his  client-centric attitude and self-initiative.

On the one hand, treasurers  need to be au fait with what is  required of them   such as KYC    and on the other to be aware,  or make their colleagues aware,  of the interaction between   real economy  business and  regulation.  Although not  necessarily financial, it comes  into play when processing  the financial parts of the  transaction because that is   the simpler bit to monitor,”  advises Baseby.  Treasurers should expect  their activities to be impacted  more in the future. This is  not only from the push for   The buzzword du jour   is  transparency , as  governments, regulators   and the public demand greater  insight into the workings of  multinationals after a series   of front-page scandals.   The unprecedented leak   of the Panama Papers earlier  this year put transparency     or rather the lack of it   in the  spotlight. The International  Consortium of Investigative  Journalists leaked more than  11.5 million financial and legal  records that exposed crime,  corruption and tax avoidance   within companies. A public  backlash ensued, and since  then transparency has stayed   at the top of the agenda.  Central registry Earlier this year, the UK was the  first G20 country to establish  a publicly accessible central  registry in a bid to shine a light  on companies. They now have  to keep a register of  people  with significant control ,  showing who really owns   and controls the company.   Transparency is becoming a  hot topic as sanctions, KYC and   moving tax rules [such   as the Organisation for  Economic Co-operation and  Development s base erosion   and profit shifting project   to reform international tax  rules] start to bite,” says  Stephen Baseby, associate  policy and technical director   at the ACT.  KYC is paramount for banks  to understand their customers,  but the requirements have  become so rigorous in recent  years that it is becoming  a barrier to trade, believes  the ACT.  The treasurer is     their responsibilities to  shareholders. This is  particularly pertinent at  publicly funded organisations,  such as housing association  Family Mosaic, which receives  funding from the Greater  London Authority and   central government.  Michael Verrier is non- executive director at Family  Mosaic, with decades of  treasury experience under his  belt, most recently at building  materials distributor Wolseley  plc, where he was group  treasurer until last year.  When  it comes to transparency in  treasury, I feel many companies  could do better. Reading  annual reports, there is a lot   of data required by accounting  standards, but [this does not  give a] clear picture,” he says.  Stakeholders primarily  want to know the company s  policies for FX management,  interest rate management,  funding strategy and capital  structure. Treasurers are  understandably nervous  about disclosing commercially  sensitive information, but  Verrier believes it is possible to  provide a clear picture of how a  company is managed by stating  a few well-defined policies and  operating parameters.     Stating these clearly and  applying these consistently  will increase stakeholder  confidence in the company,”  says Verrier.  For example, Family Mosaic  has historically had a higher  proportion of its debt at  floating rates instead of fixed  rates, making it an outlier  among its peers. But its annual  report is clear on the policy  and that the position is under  constant review.     www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer November 2016 The Treasurer  31  anti-avoidance of tax, but  also for a more equitable  allocation of tax revenues  to those countries that have  consumers.

Oxfam  works in more than 90  countries to help relieve  poverty in the worst- affected areas, from Darfur  to Syria, but it faces hurdles  sending money where it s most needed.  Sarah Love recently started in the new post  of head of global tax and treasury, which  came about as a result of a company  restructure. According to Love, the banking  sector has become increasingly risk-averse   in recent years, meaning that Oxfam has   to spend more time and effort dealing with  financial transactions in countries that are  deemed by banks to be  high risk . Banks  themselves face hefty regulatory fines if   they are found to have breached anti- money-laundering, anti-bribery and  corruption laws, even inadvertently.   Love says:  Banks are increasingly asking  questions and trying to understand exactly  where we work, what we re doing in these  countries and seeking to understand internal  controls we have in place to make sure money  doesn t end up in the hands of terrorists.”  Most recently, Oxfam hit a roadblock when  trying to donate money to Syria. One of its   intermediary banks in  Germany that had previously  transferred money to the  region changed its policy  overnight. It no longer wished  to facilitate any transactions  that involved sanctioned  countries. For three and a half  months, Oxfam could not get   any funds into war-torn Syria. Eventually,   the charity managed to find a new Belgian  intermediary bank, but Love is fully aware  that the same problem could repeat itself.   Meanwhile, charities that invest surplus  funds with investment managers are coming  under pressure to scrutinise exactly how the  monies are being invested, and ensure they  are paying the correct fees. Some charities  are paying for active managers to invest   the funds shrewdly, says Hanif Virji, partner  at AHV Associates, but they are instead  being funnelled into passive instruments   like closet tracker funds that simply track   a benchmark index like the FTSE 100. Active  management is more expensive than passive  management, meaning that some charities  are therefore paying over the odds. Virji   is currently compiling data to show which  funds are advertised and sold as actively  managed, but are actually doing no more  than tracking indices.  The new rules will  target co-mingled  funds, giving rise to   an increased tax  liability for corporates  Farah Khalique   is a freelance   business and   financial journalist  has an effect on companies   day-to-day cash management  activity, warns Tom Deas,  chairman of the National  Association of Corporate  Treasurers in the US. It is  currently standard practice   for a company to pool its excess  cash and lend it out to the  different companies within   the group structure. But the  new rules will target these   co-mingled funds, giving rise  to an increased tax liability   for corporates.  Deas says:  This has  treasurers very upset. The  [US] Treasury announced it  would not be able to use its  judgement to distinguish  between actions that were  abusive and those that were  in the ordinary course of  business. It would rather   apply these rules uniformly   to all transactions.”  A crackdown on  intercompany lending could  mean that companies have  to raise more capital via  alternative methods, such  as bank loans or the capital  markets, meaning cash piles  would be sitting idle instead   of being put to efficient use.  Shareholders vs   public interest Companies face a growing  dichotomy between the  increasing disclosure  requirements that need  to be managed and     Corporate financial management Investment  COMING OF AGE  The first Chinese fund  manager opened for  business in mid-2001.    But it wasn t until August 2004  that the money market fund  (MMF) industry took off with  the first set of guidelines from  the China Securities Regulatory  Commission (CSRC).1 After   a slow start, the number of  MMFs in China doubled  between December 2011 and  December 2013   and doubled  again by the end of 2015.  Between 2011 and 2015, MMF  assets under management  (AUM) skyrocketed 14-fold   to CNY 4.6 trillion ($704bn),  accounting for roughly 55%   of the Chinese mutual fund  industry s total AUM (see  figure 1, below). Globally,  renminbi MMFs now represent  13% of global MMF assets,2   up from just 0.5% in 2010.   The Chinese MMF industry  remains dominated by retail   CHINA S MONEY MARKET FUND INDUSTRY MAY HAVE BEEN SLOW OUT OF THE  STARTING BLOCKS, BUT IT S FAST GAINING GROUND   AND SCALE, SAYS AIDAN  SHEVLIN. THERE ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE INDUSTRY S RULES,  AIMING TO REDUCE RISK AND DELIVER GREATER LIQUIDITY FOR CORPORATE  CASH INVESTORS IN CHINA  investors, who typically focus on  a fund s yield, size and ease of  purchase when deciding which  funds to buy. The industry is  highly concentrated; the top  15 funds hold more than 60%  of AUM. Historically, given  limited distribution methods,  fund managers typically  focused on performance   as their key differentiator.   Over the years, a niche,  AAA-rated MMF industry   has developed to serve the  needs of more risk-averse  investors, including local  companies and multinationals  operating in China. While  these investors appreciate   the benefits of higher, market- driven yields, they do not   want to compromise liquidity  and security.  Evolution of China s MMFs  Preservation of capital and  liquidity has long been the   primary objective of MMFs.  With those goals in mind,  Western regulators, rating  agencies and the leading  trade association, the  Institutional Money Market  Funds Association, generally  consider five key criteria when  establishing MMF guidelines:  duration, credit ratings,  instrument type, concentration  and risk monitoring. These  relate to the key risks faced   by MMFs.   When the CSRC designed  the first renminbi MMF  guidelines back in 2004, it  modelled them on Western  guidelines. However, while the  CSRC s original guidelines did  reference the five key criteria  for MMFs, the restrictions  it imposed on the industry  were relatively loose and  interpretations of its guidelines  were similarly relaxed. In  short, fund managers typically   focused on yield at the expense  of liquidity and security.   More than a decade later,  in December 2015, the CSRC  unveiled new MMF guidelines  that market the most  significant rule changes   in the industry s history.   This latest iteration, which  represents the most important  and detailed change since the  publication of the original  guidelines, aims to make the  MMF industry more robust,  while minimising its exposure  to systemic risks. This goal   is especially critical at a time   of increasing credit and  liquidity risk.  Fund managers will have  much less freedom to interpret  this iteration of the CSRC   rules. Although we expect   a wider range of instruments  and issuers in MMFs, fund  managers are now more  responsible for assessing the  credit quality of issuers they  purchase and for protecting  their funds against adverse  market movements. For  investors, fund yields will  be lower, but fund volatility  will also decline. Meanwhile,  liquidity, credit quality and  disclosure will improve  significantly.

International rating  agency guidelines tighter  than those of the CSRC Although the new CSRC  guidelines more closely  resemble their Western  counterparts, there is still  a substantial gap between  the two standards. This gap  highlights the continued  benefits of using tighter rating  agency guidelines for investors  whose priorities are liquidity  and security.  The domestic AAA  MMF guidelines offered   years since the industry  was launched, MMFs have  become a very important asset  class, exposing investors to  the benefits of interest rate  liberalisation and market  pricing, helping to broaden  and deepen investment  markets, stimulating new  avenues of distribution  and reducing the market s  dependence on commercial  banks. The proliferation of  MMFs and the rapid growth  of AUM underline their  importance to both retail   and institutional investors.   For institutional-focused  funds with AAA ratings, the  impact of the new guidelines  will be negligible; that  is because rating agency  guidelines have significantly  tighter restrictions. For the  much larger retail MMF  sector, the new guidelines  will increase liquidity, while  reducing credit and interest  rate risk. They will also  improve disclosure standards  and encourage more proactive  credit control by the fund  manager. However, the rules  will also negatively affect fund  yields and the ability of fund  managers to outperform   their peers.   In sum, the latest iteration  of the CSRC MMF guidelines  delivers significant change.  The new guidelines encourage  a more robust investment  process and address the key  challenges facing China s  domestic MMF industry.   By any measure, that is no  small accomplishment.     www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer November 2016 The Treasurer  33  Aidan Shevlin is head   of Asia Pacific liquidity  fund management   at JPMorgan   Asset Management  by international rating  agencies in China are still  significantly tighter than the  CSRC guidelines, while also  taking account of the unique  characteristics of domestic  financial markets. These  include relatively opaque  monetary policy, unique  instruments, such as stock  exchange repo, and a more  limited range of issuers relative  to Western markets   all of  which can have a significant  impact on local market  liquidity and volatility.  Under Fitch Ratings, for  example, durations are shorter,  concentrations are tighter,   the range of approved  instruments is constrained   and credit quality limits are  quite a bit stricter. These  restrictions do limit the ability   of funds to outperform. But  they also address the key  challenges of credit risk and  liquidity risk that face Chinese  institutional investors.  Picking the right partner   is a top priority Because of the persistent  gap between the CSRC  guidelines and those of the  international rating agencies,  it is especially important for  corporate cash investors in  China with stricter investment  policies   prioritising liquidity  and security over yield   to  partner with the right liquidity  solutions provider. The most  effective partners have a deep  understanding of the markets  and will be able to react quickly  to market, regulatory and client  challenges impacting the short- term, fixed-income sector.   Conclusion: new horizons,  new opportunities The new CSRC guidelines  represent an important  milestone in what is still the  relatively brief history of  MMFs in China.

Following the signing of a Joint   Plan of Action (JPOA), a state of  commercial hopefulness surrounds   Iran. The immediate outcomes from   the lifting of economic and trade   sanctions have been: increased oil and gas  production and exports, trade deals, the  unfreezing of assets and, last, but not least,  reconnection to the worldwide interbank  financial telecommunications network.  Iran s oil and gas sector is the most  obvious beneficiary of the post-sanctions  era. The sector not only delivers around  two-thirds of the country s revenue, but  its restoration paves the way for foreign  direct investments. In a relatively short  period, the sector achieved pre-sanction  production levels of nearly four million  barrels a day and exports of two million  barrels a day, well above the expectations  at the time of the agreement, and a  development that has helped Iran   regain market share in Asia and Europe.   A wide range of foreign trade and direct  investment deals, including a handful  with US companies, were concluded  following the lifting of sanctions. Iran  also gained access to more than $100bn of  overseas frozen assets. Meanwhile, SWIFT  reconnected a number of Iranian banks,  including the Central Bank, to its network,  making financial transactions more  transparent and economical for the country.  In light of these developments, Iran s  central bank has said it expects GDP to   rise above 5% this year. The International  Monetary Fund similarly readjusted its  forecast to around 4-5.5%. Clearly, the  new era is expected to bring in significant  economic benefits. However, the  anticipated welfare is not much visible  as yet. Economic benefits do not tend  to spread evenly in state-led economies,  and international companies are still  proceeding with caution.   Corporate treasurers required to  operate in this environment will have  clear sight of the market potential, but  no straightforward answers to help them  navigate Iran s commercial landscape.  They will need to take a holistic view and  demonstrate significant patience if their  companies are to benefit while mitigating  downside risks.   A holistic view The JPOA has opened a new window. On the  one hand, traditional trading partners, such  as China, India, Russia and South Korea, are  deepening their relationships, leveraging  years of goodwill. On the other, new  partners, especially in Europe, are looking  to tap into Iran s economy, the second  largest in the region. Barely a few months  into the post-sanctions period, all these  countries  businesses had made inroads.

The post- sanctions agreement period started off  ambitiously with president Xi Jinping s  visit, paving the way to a tenfold increase in  bilateral economic relationships to $600bn  over a decade. Following China s  one belt,  one road  visit, Iran s president, Hassan  Rouhani, made progress in Europe, and  inked a number of deals   most notably   the €22bn Airbus deal, bringing Iran into  the international civil aviation community.   At the same time, Saipem was  contracted to restore the Pars Shiraz and  Tabriz oil refineries for €3.5bn; both are  essential to Iran s oil and gas sector. Total  started to lift crude oil for the National  Iranian Oil Company and to investigate  a petrochemical plant investment. Total  and Shell were granted licences to operate  branded service stations in Iran. Italy s  Danieli signed a €5.7bn deal to supply  heavy machinery and equipment   to the Iranian steel industry. And  Peugeot signed a €400m deal to join  with Khodro to produce three car  models in Iran. There are significant  gains to be made for European  businesses; economic ties presently  stand at a historic low of $10bn.   Financial risk management Manage risks    South Korea s president, Park Geun-hye,  and Indian president Narendra Modi s visits  coincided in May, and both were declared  successful. South Korea intensified the  recently eased economic relationships  threefold to $18bn from $6bn, and India  signed up to spend $500m to develop the  geopolitically important Chabahar port.   And while ties with the US will remain  challenging, Boeing and General Electric  are scoping out deals.  A thorough analysis  When it comes to doing business in  challenging territories, unemployment,  underemployment and energy price  shocks lead the list of top economic risks  in the World Economic Forum s Global   Risks Report 2016. Those are followed by  the failure of national governance, fiscal  crises, asset bubbles and cyberattacks. The  Middle East region reflects similar patterns  to the rest of the world, along with terrorist  attacks and interstate conflict. Iran is no  exception. The global risks are beyond   the scope of corporate treasurers; however,  they still need to ensure business growth,  and continuity in the face of downside  risks related to the JPOA, as well as  country-specific challenges.   At present, Iran ranks 118th out of 189 in  the World Bank s Ease of Doing Business  index. Current regulations do not necessarily  facilitate business. There is also room for  more transparency; Iran ranks 130th out of  163 in Transparency International s latest  report.

Recent economic and policy developments  around developing a diversified economy,  progressing in science and technology, and  promoting cultural excellence are helping  to improve Iran s standing in these areas.  Even so, doing business in Iran still remains  a very complex and ambiguous task for  corporate treasurers.   Businesses need to stay conscious  of remaining sanctions and specially  designated entities. The US dollar market  is not accessible, but euro trade is, so  businesses require an appropriate channel,  depending on underlying base currency,  to manage payments and collections.  The global banking system, especially   in Europe, is unclear on how to manage  transactions allowed by the JPOA. Banks  prefer to be reactive and impose enhanced  due diligence for any corporate asking  about payments and collection. Added  to which corporate treasurers will need  to manage regular business risks, such as  credit, compliance, legal and political risks.   To operate effectively, corporate  treasurers must prepare well-defined  strategic plans. That should include  comprehensive compliance details as  well as risk and reputation assessments,  exhaustive corporate intelligence,  information on access to banking and FX,  risk management and business continuity  planning. Ongoing monitoring will also  be essential to help treasurers navigate the  evolving economic and political dynamics  in the new period in Iran.   Patience  Even given recent positive economic and  policy developments, the new period will  not necessarily be straightforward.   • There may be adverse reaction to  strengthening ties between Iran and   the rest of the world, perhaps even to   the extent of one of the JPOA parties  ceasing to perform its commitments  under the agreement.   • While the oil and gas sector has seen  immediate benefits, until more certainty  and trust is generated, foreign trade  and direct investment ties are likely to  develop more slowly with sectors such  as the automotive industry, airlines,  pharmaceuticals, retail and banking.   • Iran s ability to capitalise on the new  period also depends on its ability to  continue structural economic and   policy reforms. The latest efforts score  well in improving doing business in   Iran. However, the progress is gradual,  and might fall short of corporate  treasurers  expectations.  • While the financial sector s reconnection  to the international financial system   will help the sector to reduce transaction  costs and bring in up-to-date technology  and expertise, many international banks  remain ambivalent when it comes to  reconnecting with the Iranian banking  system. Progress is likely to be slow, with  limited options for straight-through  banking services onshore.   • International companies, especially  retailers, stand to benefit from Iran s  acknowledged market potential.  However, the expected harvest might  take longer as the welfare does not  uniformly and efficiently spread,  and long-outstanding local brand  associations do not break hurriedly.   Outlook The post-sanctions period presents  a powerful commercial and financial  proposition for international companies.  Some are already reaping rewards from  signing deals early. However, the road to  successfully unlocking those propositions  will be uncomfortable. A long-term view,  thorough analysis and a significant degree of  patience are essential for corporate treasurers  seeking to manage this balancing act.   www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer November 2016 The Treasurer  35  Semih Ozkan is an ACT student  (CertlTM) and a transaction  banking professional in an  international bank  SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K  This article first appeared in the Winter 2016  issue of Middle East Treasurer.    Financial risk management Manage risks  Whether or not they  predicted the outcome   of the UK s referendum    on EU membership, the  majority of corporates rightly  anticipated significant market  volatility post-vote. As such,  they may have sought to  mitigate financial risks ahead   of time.   Those that were able to,  ensured any funding deals  were completed before June.  Corporates also made sure that  they had appropriate currency  hedges in place   in advance   of the EU referendum result.  So while some companies may  have been surprised by the  outcome of the vote, not many  felt immediate impact from   FX movements.   Nevertheless, as sterling  continually depreciated  against the euro and US dollar  following 23 June 2016, FX risk  swiftly became a key agenda  item for corporate treasurers.  In fact, a survey conducted  among Lloyds Bank s   corporate clients over the  three-week period after the  referendum result saw 35%   of respondents cite FX market  levels as their top concern   (see figure 1, below).  FOR UK CORPORATES, FINANCIAL MARKET  VOLATILITY HAS BEEN ONE OF THE FEW   CONSTANTS BEFORE AND SINCE THE EU  REFERENDUM. WHILE SOME MAY HAVE BEEN  PREPARED FOR SHORT-TERM CURRENCY  MOVEMENTS, A NEW MARKET ENVIRONMENT MEANS  THAT TREASURERS MUST CAREFULLY RE-EVALUATE  THE MANAGEMENT OF LONGER-TERM FINANCIAL  RISKS, SAY YURI POLYAKOV AND ENRIC GIRONES  have even reduced the tenor  of their existing hedges, in line  with the parameters of their  treasury policy.   Other importers, whose  treasury policy allows a level  of flexibility around the choice  of hedging instruments, have  purchased more option-based  instruments, where previously  they had used forward-based  strategies. Meanwhile, a number  of exporters are also benefiting  from a flexible treasury policy  and have extended their  hedges in order to lock in  favourable rates for longer.   The road ahead But for those treasurers who  are yet to revisit the majority  of their hedges post EU  referendum, including those  who have little flexibility in  their treasury policy, deciding  what to do once current hedges  start rolling off is becoming  increasingly important.  Determining the appropriate  hedging instruments and  horizon for new hedges can   be complex, in particular given  the volatility in the FX market,  which is expected to persist as  the UK s negotiations to leave  the EU progress.  Longer-term hedging  decisions are made even  more challenging by the  uncertainty surrounding the  future business environment.  Some corporates are currently  in  wait and see  mode   still  wondering how the UK s  trade negotiations will unfold.  Whichever route is chosen,  it is likely that the rules of  engagement for UK businesses  trading with Europe will shift.  This may result in changes   36  The Treasurer November 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  FIGURE 1: KEY RISK ISSUES FOR CORPORATES  companies and supermarket  suppliers have been among  those sectors adversely affected.   Conversely, UK exporters  whose revenues are in euros   or dollars, and costs are in  sterling are benefiting from   the weak pound. In addition,   a weaker sterling tends to   make UK exports more  attractive to overseas buyers,  potentially leading to increased  revenues from both existing  and new customers.  This split impact has led  to contrasting financial risk  management strategies being  deployed in the wake of the EU  referendum. While importers  have seen the benefits of being  hedged through the period,  they are understandably  reluctant to lock in current  unfavourable rates and are  conservative about extending  their hedges. Some importers   No level playing field Several months on from the EU  referendum, these FX market  levels continue to move and  are proving challenging for  some UK corporates.

Consequently, UK corporates  with strong trading links to  Europe not only need to prepare  for operating in a new FX  environment, but a new business  environment, too. The challenge  is how to do that effectively with  such limited visibility of the  direction and progress of the  UK s trade negotiations.  Test your assumptions Stress testing the business  model can be a good place to  start. By conducting scenario  analysis, corporates should be  able to gauge what the future  business environment might  look like, and what is the  impact of exposures and risks  they may face.   In turn, this should enable  them to better determine  whether, and how, they need to  adjust their long-term business  strategy in order to survive or  thrive in the new environment.  After all, not every risk can  be mitigated by financial  instruments   fundamental  changes in the way the business  operates may also be necessary.  Such changes might include  rethinking investment plans if  certain markets become more,  or less, profitable. Importers  might also be looking across  the board for cost-reduction   2.25  2.05  1.85  1.65  1.45  1.25  1.05  0.85  Oc t -  06     Oc t -  07     Oc t -  08     Oc t -  09     Oc t -  10     Oc t -  11    Oc t -  12     Oc t -  13     Oc t -  14     Oc t -  15     Oc t -  16     Oc t -  17     that approved by the board can  take time. Likewise, setting up  lines with banks, and putting  the appropriate derivatives  documentation in place, if a  company has not previously  entered into a master  agreement with their bank,  can limit the speed at which  changes can be made.  By starting to think about  their future hedging needs now,  corporate treasurers should find  themselves better equipped to  react more quickly to market  movements. What s more,  actively reassessing hedging  needs not only demonstrates  best practice, but also provides  an excellent opportunity for the  treasurer to make their voice  heard in the organisation and  showcase their value as a strategic  partner to the business.    evaluate the effectiveness of  their hedges by overlaying  these onto their exposures  when performing stress testing.  Time to act Firms can combine both  backward- and forward- looking measures when  designing their stress scenarios.  When examining the historical  behaviour of a risk factor, the  largest adverse and favourable  move over a certain horizon  (for example, 12 months) can  be identified (see red arrows in  figure 2). These relative moves  can then be applied to current  levels to build history-based  stress scenarios (see orange  paths in figure 2).   Alternatively, market-implied  volatility can be used to build  an interval around the future  value of a risk factor (see purple  paths in figure 2). These stress  scenarios can then be used by  corporates to better understand  the impact that adverse financial  markets may have on their net  asset values or earnings.  However, implementing  changes to financial risk  management strategies may  take longer than anticipated.  Building flexibility into a  treasury policy and getting   FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT:  A STRUCTURED APPROACH  The result of the EU referendum has clearly done   much to focus the minds of treasurers on financial risk  management. But regardless of the market environment,  treasurers may benefit from implementing the following  cycle when it comes to determining optimal strategies   for managing financial risk:   1.  Examine the business model and growth strategy,   and identify your current and future exposures/risks.  2.  Understand the impact that these exposures/risks   may have on your KPIs.   3.  Assess the effectiveness of your risk management  strategy in achieving your objectives (for example,  minimising KPI volatility).   4.  Frequently review and control the effectiveness of   your hedging strategy (product mix, tenor and  structure) to achieve your desired objectives.  solutions. These may include  switching suppliers, changing  raw materials or improving the  working capital cycle to benefit  from early-payment discounts.  Some may also look to begin  passing costs on to their  customer base, or absorb   the FX hit in their margins  where possible.   No matter which business  model changes are adopted,  it is important to ensure that  the company s hedges will  still be effective in this new  environment.

His supporters  argue that his strong business  acumen could give the US  economy a shot in the arm.   At this point, it looks like  a Trump win could bring  about a more obvious policy  shift. This could precipitate  short-term fluctuations in  US dollar markets. However,  these effects could fade as  soon as his policies prove to  be successful   or could grow  should the opposite transpire,  commentators suggest.  Trade While Clinton originally  referred to the Trans-Pacific  Partnership (TPP) as the  gold  standard” in trade agreements,  she came out in opposition   to it when negotiations  wrapped up. Traders are  likely to wait for clarity on her  position before making any  decisions here.  Under Trump s trade policy,  the North American Free Trade  Agreement and the TPP will be  revisited and higher tariffs may  be applied to Mexico and China,  with the goal of stimulating  domestic manufacturing,   according to commentators,  such as IG Index. If growth is  affected when trade ties are  cut, investors could cut their  exposure to US equities and   the dollar. Alternatively,  Trump s stance could see   the dollar rise as investors  liquidate their foreign (riskier  asset) holdings. Concerns   that Mexico s exports to the   US could be threatened have  seen the Mexican peso hover  near a historic low of 20 to the  dollar. However, the peso s ties  to the oil price and Mexico s  credit-rating woes could also   be contributing factors.   As the future of global  trade hangs in the balance,  International Monetary  Fund managing director  Christine Lagarde announced  a downgrade to the US growth  forecast and warned against  trade restrictions.   Tax Under Clinton s tax plan,  capital gains will be subject to  increased duties, there will be  a surtax on income over $5m  and corporate tax loopholes  will be closed. Analysts at IG  Index expect these stringent  measures to be reflected in   the Dow and other indices.  Trump s tax plans could   see revenues fall in the short  term. He envisions halving  corporate tax and reducing  income tax brackets from seven  to three, freeing 75 million  households from paying  tax and cutting the top-tier  maximum from 39.6% to 33%.  This could boost domestic  investment, lifting the dollar  and key indices.   Spending  According to the Committee  for a Responsible Federal  Budget s most recent report,1   Clinton s plans would increase  the debt by $200bn over   a decade above current law  levels (compared to our prior  estimate of $250bn), and  Trump s plans would increase  the debt by $5.3 trillion   (compared to our prior  estimate of $11.5 trillion).” It s     That said, the US dollar does  not always react in the same  way as other currencies. In  times of turbulence, this   safe-haven currency can  actually strengthen as investors  become concerned about the  impact on the global economy  as a whole.  On a corporate level,  increased dollar volatility could  pose varying challenges for  treasurers, depending on the  nature of their international  activities. Firms that export  to the US could see their  cash flows being hit by their  heightened FX exposure.4  This is a time for treasurers  to monitor the currency  markets carefully   especially  currency pairs like GBP/USD,  USD/JPY and EUR/USD     to facilitate well-versed  decisions around the best  timing for transfers.   Precious metals  Gold, like any safe-haven  asset, responds to ecopolitical  upheaval. Brexit saw gold rising   commodities. Metals were   up across the board, according  to Marketwatch.com.  Fed chair Janet Yellen noted  that a hike could come by  the end of the year, but for  now, the economy has  a little  more room to run”. The Fed  assembles again just a few  days shy of the election. Most  economists believe that rates  will stay put until after the  election   partially due to a   wait and see  approach, but  predominantly as a response  to sluggish global growth and  a focus on reaching maximum  employment targets.   While the Fed calls the shots  on monetary policy, decisions   made by the new president will  affect political and economic  stability, with a substantial  influence over the dollar.   Managing market volatility  From the point of view of  corporate treasurers and  financial executives, it s  essential to have robust  strategies in place alongside the  analytics and solutions needed  to give a clearer view on how  to manage FX and liquidity  risk more efficiently. This race  could still go either way; and  it s prudent for treasury to  prepare for all outcomes.   Forex Looking at the recent EU  referendum, the British pound  fell against the US dollar by  14% after the Leave vote    recording the sharpest two-  day dip by any major currency  since 1973. While it s difficult  to say whether the dollar could  plummet this low after the US  election, with either candidate  winning, the dollar is likely to  drop initially to some extent.  Amid uncertainty, investors  are likely to take flight from the  dollar in favour of more stable  global assets.   It s difficult to predict what will happen  as the race towards the Oval Office  continues to wag currency markets  by $60-80 per ounce before  levelling out in the $1,300s.  This price could fluctuate again  around the US election.  Uncertainty after a Trump  victory could lift the gold price;  whereas Clinton as president  could see gold prices losing  ground as the risk premium  falls (unless, of course, the  Republicans gain control of   the Senate).   Specific policy changes,  from either candidate, could  impact metals more broadly.  For instance, if the winning  government foregoes the TPP  and Transatlantic Trade and  Investment Partnership (TTIP),  the US could potentially  relinquish market share in the  precious metals scrap industry.   The way forward  It s difficult to predict what  will happen to markets across  the globe as the race towards  the Oval Office picks up speed  and continues to wag currency  markets. Corporate treasurers,  therefore, need to adopt a more  vigorous risk management  mindset when choosing  execution strategies and  processes, as well as analysing  which currency hedges to use.   It s important to understand  the underlying risks of FX rates  and how to measure them  before deciding on a hedging  strategy to reduce volatility.   It s also essential to analyse  market pricing to uncover  the most cost-effective hedge  structure, as well as stay abreast  of relative liquidity during   the day.  Hopefully, the US election  year may just cause a few  bumps in the road rather   than a complete change of  course for the US dollar and  world economy.     www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer November 2016 The Treasurer  39  important to note that this is a  rough and preliminary report.   The first Clinton-  Trump debate Forex traders decided Clinton  won the first debate. The  US dollar and Mexican  peso enjoyed a bump in the  aftermath, as gold prices  dipped and the safe-haven  yen weakened. According to  analysts, these moves suggest  that Clinton came out stronger  in the round.  From a market  perspective, rightly or wrongly,  there is an understanding   that Mrs Clinton would  be a safe pair of hands,”  Brad McMillan, CIO for  Commonwealth Financial   in Massachusetts explained.2  While US presidential  elections are not normally  major market movers, this  year s election shaped up as   a highly unusual contest with  substantial implications for  the economy and financial  markets, particularly FX.  History suggests that  markets respond better to  elections when the outcome  is predictable. Yet throughout  the debates, uncertainty was  the prevailing sentiment   and  we all know that markets hate  uncertainty, as evidenced by  the direct impact to US dollar  currency market sentiment   on both FX and gold markets.   A Trump victory could very  likely mean more alterations   in foreign policy and trade,   and presumably marked  changes in American politics.  This, in turn, could insulate   the US from its trading  partners and have an effect  on exports. It could also see  immediate, but short-term,  fluctuations in the US dollar  markets due to the uncertainty  about the effects of Trump s  policies on the US economy.3   Adding to this market  trepidation is the possibility  of a Federal Reserve interest- rate increase.

Since  infrastructure projects will  likely be supported by central  governments, a lack of country  knowledge and the complexity  involved in evaluating multiple  countries could prevent credit  analysts from assessing the   order to ensure the mechanism  is in place, a definite concept  that everyone agrees on is badly  needed. The concept should  not be too rigid, so as to allow  for flexibility in structuring  the new bonds, but it needs to  be sufficiently clear to prevent  exploitation of the additional  support mechanism.   In general, the Silk Road  bond concept should entail  the use of proceeds to fund  infrastructure projects along  the Belt and Road routes.   Silk Road projects will need  to be defined, and proposers  should also indicate the  anticipated benefits to Belt   and Road countries. In that  sense, a ratio of economic  benefits to the country where  the project is situated to  economic benefits to other   Belt and Road countries   could be a good indicator  of overall value. Dagong is a  member of a working group,  organised by the International  Capital Market Association,  working with many market  participants to establish a Silk  Road bond concept.  Multiple countries of risk Proposed Silk Road routes take  in many different territories  and, as a result, there are two  key credit considerations.  First, given the diverse   Silk Road bonds could   be an innovative capital  market solution with    the potential to benefit a vast  number of people in Belt and  Road countries, many of which  have been previously ignored  by the international bond  market. Their development  will help spur the economy   not only of China, but also  other countries along Belt   and Road routes, a win-win   for global trade and for poverty  reduction. At the same time,  there is a need for third-party  verification for this new asset  class and perhaps an external  support mechanism to ensure  investors can assess the risk  versus return trade-off.   Definite concept needed Silk Road bonds could offer  investors both portfolio  diversification into other Belt  and Road countries, and extra  yield in exchange for lower  liquidity and longer tenor.  However, first and foremost,  the concept needs to be  clarified by the investment  communities and governments  of the Belt and Road countries,  especially China. As yet, there  is no single concept for Silk  Road bonds.   In our view, Silk Road bonds  could come with an additional  support mechanism and, in   SILK ROAD BONDS COULD BECOME ANOTHER  KEY ASSET CLASS AS CHINA REACHES OUT TO  THE WEST UNDER THE ONE BELT, ONE ROAD   INITIATIVE. WARUT PROMBOON EXPLAINS  HOW THEY DIFFER FROM OTHER ASSET   CLASSES IN STRUCTURE AND RISK  LAYING   A PATH  SOURCE: HONG KONG TRADE DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL  SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K  level of external support  those projects might receive.  Another issue is how well  the investor community will  be able to gauge the level of  mutual support of countries  along the Belt and Road  routes. Simply speaking, a  failure to pay in one country  could affect subsequent  projects in other countries  along the routes, so the   Belt and Road routes      www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer November 2016 The Treasurer  43  Multiple regulatory  regimes Silk Road bonds can be listed  in multiple countries and  under different regulatory  regimes, especially multiple  Belt and Road countries.  Every Silk Road bond could  carry different disclosures,  accounting standards, laws  and languages. In addition,  investors may not have access  to some markets, which will  make some Silk Road bonds  less liquid.  Different accounting  standards mean foreign  companies could be  discouraged from issuing Silk  Road bonds in a country where  they need to convert their  accounting standards (as in the  case of Panda Silk Road bonds,  where issuers would need to  provide financial statements  according to Chinese  Accounting Standards).  Extra features We believe many Silk Road  bonds will come with extra  features, such as sustainability  (ie Green bonds) and/or   Sharia compliance (ie Sukuk  bonds). These features are  compatible and can overlap.  So there could be Green Silk  Road bonds, Sukuk Silk Road  bonds or even Green Sukuk  Silk Road bonds. The Chinese  government is committed to  the growth of the Green bond  market. Likewise, the new  Silk Road covers many Islamic  countries and we would not   be surprised to see Sukuk   Silk Road bonds marketed   to Islamic investors.  Certification We believe all of the above  unique features could  necessitate Silk Road bond   Secured bonds Potentially, Silk Road   bonds could be secured with  assets such as infrastructure  projects. To properly gauge   the credit risk of secured  bonds, credit analysts   will need to understand   the recovery rate of these  assets. The subsequent issue  would be whether a project  will be a brownfield or  greenfield project.  For a brownfield project  or a project in operations  that already generate cash  flow, investors may not have  a reliable default history,  recovery information or tested  bankruptcy procedures in  many of the Belt and Road  countries. For a greenfield  project, or a project either  under construction or a  project that has not started  construction at all, project  finance will require experts    to look into a project s  future cash flow. We believe  independent third parties   (ie credit rating agencies)  could come in to study  underlying assets so that  investors can properly assess  the recovery rate of the bonds.  External support  mechanism We believe one of the solutions  for difficulties in assessing  multiple countries of risk and  unfamiliar underlying assets  is a credit enhancement,  ie a guarantee or a wrap,  either from a government or  commercial banks (in the form  of standby letters of credit).  Long tenor Silk Road bonds  tenor could  be long, ie 10 years or more,  as Silk Road bond proceeds  could be used to fund long- term infrastructure projects.  A longer tenor makes external  support in terms of guarantees  by multilateral organisations  problematic, in our view.  existence of mutual support  will be critical.   Second, investors may lack  knowledge of some of the  countries along the routes   and, in fact, these countries are  likely to be the ones that most  need new infrastructure in  the first place. Many Belt and  Road countries are not very  well known to investors and  the majority of the Belt and  Road countries are classified  as high risk by the investment  community. Despite the  fact that only two out of 65  countries along the Belt and  Road routes are not rated  by any major international  rating agencies (Iran and  Turkmenistan), many countries  do not have a presence in the  international bond market.  The median and average GDP  per capita of Belt and Road  countries were $5,496 and  $10,402, respectively, according  to the latest information from  the World Bank, both low  compared with those of   many developed countries.   Warut Promboon is chief rating   officer at Dagong Global Credit   Rating Ltd in Hong Kong  certification by third parties.  In fact, third-party verification  may be needed from the outset  to certify whether Silk Road  bond proceeds are genuinely  to be used to fund Belt and  Road countries, and whether  a project is qualified as a Belt  and Road project.  Finally, investors will need  to be able to differentiate  credit quality among Silk  Road bonds. In general,  investors carry out credit  due diligence through credit  ratings and credit research.  The former relies on local and  international rating agencies,  while the latter relies on  in-house credit teams, asset  managers and/or sell-side  research houses. We believe  that we need sufficient rating  coverage for Silk Road bonds,  as dedicated in-house research  could take time to be built  up. However, we expect the   availability of research and  ratings on Silk Road bonds to  grow in tandem with the rising  demand and supply of Silk  Road bonds.  In conclusion, we believe  Silk Road bonds are here   to stay, but there are a  few loose ends that major  governments along the Belt  and Road routes, together   with the investment  community, must work on  together. A simple form of  government-guaranteed  project bonds, of which  proceeds will be used to invest  along the Belt and Road  routes   could be a useful first  step to draw more investor  attention. We believe that  there is liquidity waiting to be  deployed and that investors are  ready for this new asset class.   Silk Road bonds could offer investors portfolio  diversification into other Belt and Road countries    Treasury operations Technology  In any business process,  if you keep doing the same  things, then at best you will get  the same results.

Nevertheless, who wouldn t  want to  push a button   with simplified, bespoke  and integrated solutions to  consolidate and standardise  processes and reporting? Yet  treasury remains a complex  discipline, unique to business  and sector, and making  decisions on when, where and  how to invest are not easy.  Creating a case   for investment The most important question  is: what will new technology  add to treasury s capability? As  a starting point, you will need a  solid and tangible business case  for investment. Most corporates  will face constant challenges  from within to deliver year-on- year cost savings and this can  only be achieved by looking   at new ways of doing things.  Once expected benefits  have been mapped to these  objectives, the risks in not  making the technology  investment can overshadow  financial cost savings. Making  suboptimal financing decisions  or not being able to provide  timely financial reports could  cost your organisation more  than the cost of the capital  investment in technology.  Think broader Technology-led transformation  needs excellent planning to  realise its potential.  Out of   the box  rarely works. Begin  with the end in mind, and   you are more likely to benefit  from broader business change.

Realistically, any investment  you make needs to be viewed  as the start of a rolling  programme. This positions your  treasury function to think as  a market innovator, or at least  as a fast follower, that is open  to keeping pace as products  and services evolve, from  cybersecurity to biometrics,  predictive analytics to robotics,  and even blockchain.   A technology-led change  project can also be a great  way to motivate your people.  Developing a shared vision of  a new technology and process  landscape, and then sharing  the highs and lows of delivering  it, can pull together a bonded,  agile new team.  A question of how   far to go Technology should encourage  the right balance of releasing  people from transactional work  while maintaining an optimised  control environment,  becoming more algo and  performing more value-adding  activities. How much of your  treasury waterfront can it cover,  and how agile is it to respond  to change? A well-thought- through approach and process  of continual improvement  could even remove the need for  a button to push   as it requires  someone to decide to press it.   Do nothing  is no longer a  viable option: not only will it  entail missing out on improved  efficiencies and lower costs,   but failing to consider emerging  technologies in your landscape  could mean losing competitive  advantage or   worse    unacceptable operational   and reputational risk for   the organisation.   improvement) and  soft  (better  reporting accuracy).   Traditionally, one of the  most common business case  problems in treasury has been  quantifying the hard benefits.  With treasury teams small in  number, the headcount savings  are rarely evident. So it is  critical to articulate clearly the  softer benefits   such as real- time reporting or more accurate  cash forecasting   and the  business value that they bring.  People make decisions  based on intangibles as well  as tangibles. Always include  qualitative benefits as a  potential deal clincher.  Flexibility and a   bi-modal approach The programme must be  flexible enough to be future- proof and a  bi-modal   approach will help link the  current landscape to the  desired end state. Mode 1  targets stability in getting the  most from existing core system  effectiveness. You are likely   to have an existing landscape  and ways of working.  Maximising this will appeal   to the budget holders.   Mode 2 focuses on agility  and ongoing investment in  development, innovation  and change. Using the latest  technology in innovative ways,  or being at the leading edge, is  unlikely to be a smooth process  because there is less experience  available to guide you. The  complexities of getting layered  products to work together with  your core system and be  right  first time  can be costly without  access to a combination that  has been developed, tried and  tested in practice elsewhere.  Implementation basics Strong project management  is the key driver of  implementation success  and can overcome budget  constraints, overburdened    staff, scarcity of resources  and tight timelines. Key  stakeholders need early  identification: who is currently  experiencing the  pain ; who  will provide input during the  project; who will benefit; who  needs to approve the project;  who will be accountable   during the implementation,  and so on. Accountability   instils responsibility.   Identifying core  implementation roles is also  essential, including those who  can identify and solve problems  as they arise; those who have  subject matter expertise; those  who possess the seniority to  allocate internal resources and  those who have the capability to  oversee the vendor relationship  and keep the project on track.   Requirements must be  prioritised and aligned to  the budget provided, and  the complexity of each must  be understood. Different  platforms and feeds may be in  scope, including market data,  trading, banking, various forms  of enterprise resource planning  (ERP) and middleware.  Whichever areas are targeted,  a clear critical path is needed,  and interdependencies must   be tracked.   Deeper ERP integration,  increasing automated  transaction posting and  reconciliations, insight and  intelligence analytics, mobile  and digital developments,  and even a shift to hosted  or outsourced support  could evolve within the  implementation timeframe, as  benefits are seen and realised.   Keep learning Finally, having taken the leap  of faith and invested in the  technology that you hope will  take your treasury function  forward, it is vital at each step  to analyse what is working,  what isn t and what you can  learn for next time. The pace of   How much of an edge will  these factors give you in terms  of performance, and how can  these be demonstrated as  providing value to the business  as a whole?  This is one of the best  outcomes of new technology  solutions: not only can they  help you do what you currently  do better, but they can also  enable you to expand in   new directions.   Cost of delaying In examining real costs and  whether there is an appetite to  invest, you also have to consider  whether you can afford not to  invest. The common challenge  for investment is to find ways  to reduce costs or save time.  Technology that delivers either    or both   of these will give  you an edge, which in turn  could lead to better judgement,  accuracy and certainty that  more than justifies your  investment. How  algo  can and  should your treasury function  become? You need to identify  the costs to your business of not  investing in new technology.

Hype around how  Facebook, Google and   others are using search and  self-learning algorithms  can make it seem as if every  algorithm is cutting edge.   It is not. An algorithm is   any specific method, process   or set of rules that can be  used to complete a clearly  defined task, which could   be processing data, solving    a problem or achieving a  goal. Self-learning algorithms  take things to another level  and The Treasurer recently  explored the implications for  the future of treasury roles  (see www.treasurers.org/ node/322545). See also the  ACT blog at https://blogs. treasurers.org/whats-on-  the-horizon-for-treasurers   The potential of  smart   self-learning algorithms is  massive. At Essex University,  Professor Maria Fasli is using   multiple, goal-oriented,  self-learning algorithms  called agents to analyse big  data on the behaviour of the  massive and complex FX  market: extracting patterns  of behaviour, formulating  hypotheses to explain them,  developing simulations to   test these and then refining  them to the point where they  can predict the behaviour of  the market.   Get smart  Traditional software  applications need to be told  explicitly what it is that they  need to accomplish and the  exact steps that they have to  perform. Agents need to be  told what the goal is, but not  how to achieve it,” says Fasli.  Being smart, they actively  seek ways to satisfy this goal,  reacting to changes in the  environment as they occur,  then modifying their course  of action to accomplish their  goal.  We will increasingly be  delegating tasks and goals to  such systems and interacting  with them,” she predicts.   Many of us now depend  on rule-based algorithms,  personally and professionally.   They are already in use in  cash pools, zero-balancing  pools, notional pools, cash  concentration and that  sort of thing,” says Sanjay  Bibekar, treasury technology  lead at PwC. With cash  concentration, for example,  software uses algorithms to  ensure that sub-accounts  have a constant/zero balance  and that debit and credit  balances are automatically  physically swept into the  concentration account (when  local regulation allows).   Banks and treasury  management system (TMS)  developers have been using  algorithms for years to  offer the cash management  functionality in their products  and services. There is nothing  new about software programs  that enable treasurers  to complete tasks more  efficiently and effectively   IF TREASURERS ARE TO MAKE THE MOST OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES,  IT S TIME TO DEMYSTIFY THE ALGORITHM. LESLEY MEALL EXPLAINS  AGE OF      www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer November 2016 The Treasurer  47  This need not be a barrier to  exploring rule-based treasury  use cases. For example,  analysing bank charges,  comparing them with the rate  card and determining whether  you are paying the least you  could for them; managing  credit and risk analysis of cash  and liquidity across multiple  cash investment strategies;  optimising the control,  timing, price and execution  of currency orders. FX is an  area where banks are already  helping corporates to explore  the benefits.  Think big For example, a large corporate  can control the execution  and risk of a strategy to  buy currency for one large  (and material) transaction,  with the help of rule-based  algorithms. By using bank  infrastructure that enables it  to: split its currency purchase  into small trades; define the  start and end time for the  strategy and the conditions  affecting this; limit the  maximum strategy price by  setting the frequency and  timing of trades; setting the  maximum spread to limit the  impact of currency volatility  and wide spreads on the  corporate s average rate.  Developing the complex  algorithms to achieve this   is a massive undertaking    about the skills and software  that would be needed to  make them a reality. Then  there are issues such as the  need for back testing, manual  oversight and security. The  biggest impediment to rapid   Excel into Outlook, where he  has set up a maturity ladder.   Like all treasurers, Fell is  focused on risk and is keen  to highlight the potential  strengths of an off-the-shelf  TMS.  I tend to work in  sectors where transaction  values are high and volumes  are low, such as real estate  and mining. A TMS is more  effective when there are  many more deals or you are  operating an in-house bank,”  he says. Lack of control may  also be an issue.  If somebody  makes a mistake, they can  make it look as if they didn t,  by editing the spreadsheet.  With a TMS, data is more  secure and you have an   audit trail.”  It may be a mistake to  allow your aspirations or  achievements to be limited  by the overblown hype that  surrounds self-learning  algorithms, or to become  distracted by differences of  opinion and interpretation  around the associated  language.  When it comes to  drawing lines between terms  of reference like analytics,  algorithms and data science,  there s a lot of semantics  involved,” says James Murray,  who specialises in this area at  the recruiter Robert Walters.

Most of the time we use them  without thinking about this;  particularly when we are not  alerted to their presence by  the names of products and  services and practices, such   as algorithmic trading.  Look beyond the hype As algorithms have become  part of popular culture and  everyday language, it can  seem as if they have also  been endowed with near- mythical powers, but the  widespread focus on cutting- edge applications can be  misleading. Computer-based  trading strategies (such as  high-frequency trading),  which are supported by  algorithms, may grab the  headlines; nonetheless,  numerous treasurers are   using algorithms to help   them to solve everyday  problems and manage   core treasury processes.  This does not demand  the latest technology or  specialist software, though  such tools can help. Once  you have devised a method  (aka algorithm) to complete a  task, you can use productivity  tools such as the spreadsheet  Microsoft (MS) Excel and  other software applications   in the family (such as Outlook  and Word) to automate this.   I write Visual Basic routines  that create reports, move  data around and feed it into  other systems,” says interim  treasurer Chris Fell.   Treasurers who are not   on first-name terms with   the formulas and functions  in MS Excel, or able to  programme using Visual  Basic, may be surprised by  what Fell can achieve.  I have  a spreadsheet database for  FX trades, then a routine that  takes the most recent line  on that spreadsheet, posts  individual data points into   a Word program, which then  produces a confirmation for  matching and signature,”   he explains.

Nonetheless, there are  still good reasons to keep  a watching brief on what  algorithms make possible,   as this evolves.  Adam Gable, a treasury  specialist with the banking  software vendor Temenos,  has high hopes for the future,  which he shares by explaining  how a corporate treasury  in a global operation could  exploit rule-based algorithms  to manage liquidity and  ensure the best return on  surplus.  Unless there is a  clear strategy around this  and the ability to execute the  same swiftly, it is difficult to  achieve optimal returns,” he  says. A manual process can  be repetitive, exhausting  and create delays that lead  to potential loss of good  opportunities to invest.    An algorithm that could  assess liquidity across the  group, identify surplus,  assess market rates for  the instruments under  consideration and then  identify the best asset class  and provider, even suggesting  currency conversions where  appropriate, would certainly  have legs,” he says.   But there are even more  impressive possibilities  shimmering on the horizon.  He adds:  Introduce machine  learning, which, given the  time of the month and year,  could predict the most  optimal trade, and we are in  corporate treasury utopia.”   An algorithm is any  specific method,  process or set of  rules that can be  used to complete  a clearly defined  task, which could  be processing data,  solving a problem  or achieving a goal    2 3  1  48  The Treasurer November 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  PERFORMANCE RATIOS ARE  IMPORTANT, BUT OFTEN MIXED  UP. DOUG WILLIAMSON OFFERS  CLARITY TO HELP YOU AVOID  THE RED HERRINGS  SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K  WINNING  PERFORMANCE   Treasurers need to make decisions  based on the financial performance  of many different organisations,  including our own. So we need to  understand how to evaluate financial  information in a rigorous and consistent way.  It s not just profits Profits are vital, especially to shareholders  and other investors. But how much  investment does the business need, to   earn the profits? If the capital investment   is too great, the profits aren t so attractive.  Return on capital Treasurers use ratios to compare different  businesses. For example, return on   capital ratios divide profit by capital, to  calculate a percentage rate of return on   the capital investment.  Return on capital  Profit   ÷ Capital  = Rate of return %  Treasurers need to understand Return on capital is a fundamentally  important performance measure.   Key applications for treasurers are to: •  Appraise business investment proposals; •  Evaluate creditworthiness; and •  Support investor relations.  Different perspectives Return on capital ratios include: •  Return on equity (ROE); and •  Return on capital employed (ROCE,      sometimes pronounced  rocky ).  Practitioners vary both the measure of  profit and the measure of capital, depending  on which investors they re considering.  ROE ROE is an essential ratio for shareholders.   It looks at the after-tax profits earned for  shareholders, using the shareholders    equity capital.   ROE  Investors Shareholders  Profit Profit after tax  Capital Equity  Better or worse? Let s see how the treasurer uses ROE to  take a shareholder s perspective, to analyse  two different companies. Their financial  performance includes:   Company A B  $m $m  Profit after tax 6 7  ÷ Equity 40 80  = ROE 15% 8.8%  Business skills Qualifications    Company B is earning greater profits   of $7m, compared with Company A s $6m. But Company B is using twice as much  equity capital to earn its profits. Company B   is using equity of $80m, compared with  Company A s $40m.   As a result, Company B is earning an  inferior return of 8.8% for its shareholders,  compared with Company A s 15%.  All other things being equal, Company A  is the better investment.  Avoid red herrings Like many financial ratios, the final  calculation of ROE is a simple division of  one number by another. The trickier bit   can be remembering what to divide by   what, especially if a question contains   red herrings.  Red herrings are non-relevant  information, which is potentially distracting.  Exams often contain one or two red   herrings, to test our practical ability   to identify and use the relevant   information only.  Company C  Company C has reported: operating profit  €12m, profit after tax €7m, equity €70m and  non-current liabilities €30m.   Calculate the return on equity. Based on CertTF 2016 question  Relevant information The information we need for our ROE  calculation is the profit after tax of €7m,   and the equity of €70m.   ROE (€m)  Profit after tax   ÷ Equity  7   70  = ROE 10%  The other data in this question isn t   relevant for the ROE calculation.   However, it would be relevant for ROCE.  ROCE perspective The important difference between ROE   and ROCE is their perspective:  •   ROE assumes the viewpoint of the   shareholders only; while •   ROCE takes the wider perspective of all   capital providers, not just shareholders.  Profit and capital To reflect this wider perspective, ROCE s  profit and capital measures are both  different. Keeping it simple at this stage,  the profit measure is normally operating   Doug Williamson is a  treasury and finance coach  profit. Again, keeping it simple for now, the  capital definition is normally equity plus  non-current liabilities. This wider measure  of capital, defined for the ROCE evaluation,  is known as capital employed.   ROCE  Investors All capital providers  Profit Operating profit  Capital Capital employed  ROCE for Company C We ve already calculated Company C s   ROE as 10%. Now let s calculate its ROCE.  The information we need is:  Operating profit = €12m Equity = €70m Non-current liabilities = €30m  Now we need two steps:  (1) Capital employed; then  (2) ROCE.  (1) Capital employed This is the total of equity and non-current  liabilities:  70 + 30 = €100m  (2) ROCE  ROCE (€m)  Operating profit   ÷ Capital employed  12   100  = ROCE 12%  Using financial statements The treasurer often needs to extract  important information from financial  statements. For example, Company D s  financial statements include:  Profit or loss (€m)  Operating profit   Interest and tax  24   (10)  Profit after tax 14  Financial position (€m)  Equity  Non-current liabilities  140   60  Capital employed 200  Company D  Using the financial statements (above),  calculate company D s: (a) ROE; and (b) ROCE.  Answers below   Refining ROCE assessment Depending on the context, and available  information, the ROCE evaluation is  sometimes refined. We might refine either  or both of:  (a) The capital measure; and (b) The relevant profits.  (a) Capital employed: refinements Two potential adjustments are:  (1)  Short-term borrowings, if they are  being used as part of longer-term  capital, to add to capital employed; and  (2) Cash and cash equivalents, to net off.  It s essential to confirm all definitions in  practice, and then apply them consistently.  (b) Profits and tax Profits for the ROCE evaluation are  sometimes after tax. When ROCE is used  in value-added analysis, it is always after  tax. This is because the tax authorities must  always be paid first. Any remaining surplus  for the investors will be after tax.

This month, there is an opportunity to join that effort by entering or nominating your  organisation for The Treasurer s Deals of the Year Awards   a chance to flag up the transactions and  initiatives that really put your organisation ahead of the pack.

In July, G20 finance ministers endorsed a  15-point action plan from the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)  with the laudable aim of limiting aggressive tax planning on the part of multinationals and levelling  the playing field across businesses.  The project   base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)   has been many years in the making.  However, while the OECD has worked to create a way for governments to sign up to the initiative  without surrendering their business-friendly credentials, BEPS is not without its implementation  issues and headaches for treasurers. Business journalist Michelle Perry explores the issue in our  lead feature on page 22.  This month, we get to look over the shoulder of Microsoft s structured finance guru in Dubai.  Rahul Daswani, group treasury manager, plays a pivotal role in securing sales by evaluating the  credit risk and liquidity needs of the tech giant s customers and channel partners for the region.   It s a standout example of how treasurers can support their organisations by being closely focused  on solutions. Business journalist Ben Poole s profile of Daswani begins on page 18.  Our issue this month has a special focus on cash management. Rebecca Brace gives an overview  of innovations in payments on page 28 and, in addition, we look at the cash conversion cycle across  Europe, trends in payments and settlements across the globe, and cash mountains   why they exist  and whether corporates are likely to do away with them any time soon.

Retail sales and  consumer confidence  have rebounded and  the economy has been  assisted by a weaker  pound and the Bank   of England rate cut, say   commentators. However,  business confidence has  fallen in Europe, and  inflation in the UK and   on the continent is low.  At the time of writing,  secretary of state for  Exiting the European  Union David Davis  (pictured, right) has  not given details on  the direction Brexit  negotiations would   take or when they would  begin. However, he has   indicated that the UK  will try to negotiate a  bespoke relationship with  the EU versus a solution  such as membership of  either the European Free  Trade Association or the  European Economic   Area. The government has  indicated that it is unlikely  to trigger Article 50, which  starts negotiations to leave  the EU, until next year.  The apparent  postponement has drawn   fire from Europe. Erik  Schweitzer, head of the  German chamber of  commerce and industry,  criticised prime minister  Theresa May s decision   to postpone Brexit talks  until next year, telling   the Financial Times:    The deadlock is creating  a situation in which many  investments are now held  up and will not be carried  out because people   don t know what the   conditions will be over  three or four years.”  Meanwhile, Donald  Tusk, president of the  European Council, has  said that starting the  negotiations as soon   as possible is in   everyone s interests.  BRIEFING  06  The Treasurer October 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  { CORPORATE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT }  EUROPEAN CORPORATES TAKE   BOND YIELDS INTO NEGATIVE TURF  Henkel, a German consumer  goods group, and French   pharmaceutical business Sanofi  became the first private corporates  to sell bonds with negative yields,  last month.  The milestone issues are a further  indication of how central bank  measures to reduce borrowing costs  for governments and companies are  upending market practices.  Henkel successfully issued a  €500m two-year bond with an initial   yield of -0.05% and a couple of 0%.  It is one of four tranches across three  currencies, with the other three  tranches at 0% or positive yields.  Henkel also issued a €700m   five-year bond with a coupon and  yield of 0% pa; a $750m three-year  bond with a coupon of 1.5% pa and   a £300m six-year bond with a coupon  of 0.875%. The initial yields for the  dollar and sterling bonds are 1.55%  and 0.95% respectively.  The acquisition of Sun Products  is valued at €3.2bn and will be  financed by a three-year bank loan  of €1bn in addition to the proceeds  of the bonds.  Sanofi sold €1bn of three-and-  a-half-year debt, also at a yield   of -0.05%.  With yields in negative territory,  backers are paying to invest, but  if bond yields fall even more,   bond price rises and investors can  sell the bond at a profit. Central  banks are notable buyers, with the  European Central Bank expanding  its quantitative easing programme to  include corporate bond purchases in  June this year.  The ACT s associate policy and  technical director, Steve Baseby, said  corporates may find negative yield  debt attractive for new investment  or refinancing, but their business  returns will also be under pressure,  so they will need to consider  whether they are ahead in the round.    More immediate concerns are  that any surplus cash generated by  the bonds may earn an even more  negative yield. What is unknown is  whether these bonds are attractive   as an alternative to government debt,  and cause debt investors to diversify  into corporate debt,” he said.

The Global Fintech Hubs Federation  (GFHF) will cover more than 20 countries,  including Canada, China, Germany, Mexico,  Switzerland and the UK, and has been formed  in partnership with Innotribe   the financial  services innovation wing of worldwide  payments network SWIFT.  As well as its ambition to support global  engagement on fintech matters and industry  best practices, the GFHF will also develop a  global set of knowledge standards in the field  and build bridges between member hubs.   It will provide fintech hubs with a global   voice in the business and finance community.  While Innovate Finance and Innotribe have  stressed that the GFHF will be a cooperative  rather than competitive organisation, it will   nonetheless rank its member hubs according  to several criteria   such as ease of doing  business, talent and capital availability.  Innovate Finance CEO Lawrence  Wintermeyer said:  Coordination and cross- border dialogue between emerging fintech  start-ups, established fintech companies,  financial institutions and policymakers remains  key for the long-term success of our sector.   The launch of the GFHF will provide a  platform for global fintech players and hubs  to share knowledge and build an inclusive  community network. This will help to  accelerate the growth and influence of   global fintech, and shape a better financial  services future.”  SWIFT and Innotribe global head of  securities markets Fabian Vandenreydt said:   Innotribe looks forward to foster a bigger  and stronger fintech ecosystem through this  initiative, bringing its expertise and leveraging  its network for the benefit of the banking and  start-up communities.”  { CONTEXT OF TREASURY }  EBRD to publish  data on NPLs  Details of non-performing loans (NPLs) in  emerging Europe are to be detailed in a new   online resource from the European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).  The bank has launched the website with the  aim of gathering as much policy and finance  industry research as possible around poorly  performing loans in the Central, Eastern and  Southeastern region, which, it says, has some  of the highest and most persistent levels of  Europe s €1.1 trillion in NPL stocks.   The EBRD says sharing information about  NPLs will help strengthen the banking system  within Europe s emerging countries.  The bank says it hopes the resource will aid  transparency and the development of frameworks  that will promote efficient restructuring.  { KEY FINDINGS FROM THE CAPGEMINI WORLD WEALTH REPORT 2016 }   EU member states have a  sovereign right to determine their  own tax laws.

Data from SWIFT show renminbi  use in payments sent from and received by  South Africa increased by 65% over the past   12 months and by 112% over the past two years.  The increase marks strengthening trade  ties between South Africa with China and  Hong Kong.  The establishment of a renminbi  clearing centre in South Africa, as well as  Singapore s increased use of the renminbi  for payments with South Africa, have been a  catalyst for renminbi growth in the region,” says  Harry Newman, head of banking at SWIFT.  The data also show how one country s  increasing use of the renminbi can benefit  existing financial centres for the currency.    While South African institutions have  been stepping up renminbi payments with  counterparties beyond Hong Kong and China    and Singapore has been a notable beneficiary  of this   the growth in overall volumes of payments from South Africa this year means   that payments exchanged with Hong Kong and  China are much higher than they were at the  end of 2015,” says Vina Cheung, global head of  renminbi internationalisation, global liquidity  and cash management, HSBC.    South Africa is still in the early stages of  renminbi adoption, but we believe there is  considerable potential for growth in payments  exchanged with this key African economy and  other emerging markets.”  { AROUND THE WORLD IN 30 DAYS }  BoE SETTLEMENTS, AIRLINES, INVESTMENT BANKS BoE settlements to   be  blockchain ready  Non-bank payment providers  will be able to access a new  payments settlement system,  according to proposals  published by the UK s   central bank.  The Bank of England (BoE)  has released information about  a replacement for its 20-year- old Real-Time Gross Settlement  system, which daily handles  around £500bn of payments  between banks.  The new system will be  compatible with distributed  ledger technology and capable  of operation 24 hours a day,  seven days a week. The current  system operates 12 hours per  working day.  The BoE will conduct a  public consultation closing in  December and publish a final  plan early next year. Volatility hits Asian airlines  FX volatility has damaged  performance at China s biggest   state-run airlines, according to  figures released by the Shanghai  Stock Exchange.  Profits at China Southern  Airlines were down 10.4%   for the first half of 2016, while  profits at China Eastern Airlines  fell 9.3%. At Air China, profits  fell 17.5%.  A 6% devaluation of the yuan  between August last year and  the end of June this year was  cited as the cause.  Southern s chairman, Wang  Changshun, said that his  carrier had worked hard to  mitigate its problems through   advanced repayment of US- dollar liabilities” and a swap  of its dollar obligations under  finance leases, reducing its  commitments around the   US currency.  In tandem with that,  he added:  The financing  proportion of renminbi   increased to 50.8% from 31.7%  at the beginning of the year    therefore, the impact of the  exchange loss decreased.” Income fall at investment banks In the biggest fall in revenues  since the global financial crisis, the world s biggest investment  banks took a 15% hit on their  combined income.  A lack of deals, together with  falls across stocks, bonds and  commodities, were behind the  fall, particularly in the first  quarter of 2016, according to  a report from London-based  research outfit Coalition.  Income from trading stocks  and bonds, advising on M&A  and capital raising, was $79bn  for the half year, down from  $93.3bn in the first half of 2015.   Coalition says the banks  expect the picture to improve  over the second half of 2016.  However, regulation around  capital and risk-taking are likely  to keep a lid on growth.  Asian airlines suffer as  a result of FX volatility    This year marks two  decades of the outstanding  achievements of corporate  treasurers and their teams   Celebrating 20 years  of treasurers  deals   Nominations will soon be under way for The Treasurer s Deals of the Year Awards 2016. And what  better way to showcase your  achievements among the most  talented and innovative treasury  and finance professionals than by  making the cut in its 20th year?  The first deals officially recognised,  in 1997, were those of UK companies  deemed noteworthy   in other words to  have  caught the eye  of The Treasurer. And  all against a backdrop of the Asia financial  crisis, Hong Kong s return to Chinese rule,  a second term for Bill Clinton and, in the  UK, Tony Blair becoming prime minister,  the Financial Services Authority coming into  being and the Bank of England being given  independence by Chancellor Gordon Brown   to set interest rates. Among the winners were  ICI s acquisition financing to buy Unilever s  speciality chemical business, Stakis s foray  into the private placement market, Castle  Transmission International s bond offering  to refinance debt, and The Daily Mail and  General Trust s exchangeable bonds.  Since this comparatively understated  start, The Treasurer s Deals of the Year   Awards have grown and evolved  from an inaugural awards lunch in  2003 at Cazenove, where a shortlist  of winners in six categories were  voted for by ACT members and   Treasurer readers, to the first dinner  event held at Drapers  Hall to mark   the 10th anniversary. The 2007 awards also  saw the launch of a new category   Treasury  Team of the Year. This become two awards    split into large and mid-cap team categories  the following year   and in 2012, the ACT  included an award for the European Treasury  Team of the Year.

Elsewhere, we are monitoring the development of the Brexit plan and continue  our conversations with regulators and key decision-makers to ensure that the  voice of the corporate is heard. Further afield, EU money market fund (MMF)  legislation evolves, while the new US MMF rules come into being this month     make sure your policies remain effective.  If you have views you d like to share with the ACT policy and technical team on any of these subjects or have your own submission you are willing to share,  please email us at technical@treasurers.org  The Bank of England (BoE)  has started its next phase    of quantitative easing (QE):  the attempt to stimulate  investment by lowering  long-term lending costs by  competing in the markets   to buy UK government and  corporate debt.  This follows the lowering of  the base rate to 0.25%, to lower  further short-term investment  yields and encourage cash  holders, individuals and  businesses to risk their deflating  cash asset on other assets.  The problem the UK shares  with other Western economies  is that the acceptable stimuli  have become few. The BoE  has base rates and QE, a target  consumer price inflation of  2% (currently 0.6%), coupled  with a commitment to a  stable financial system. The  government of the moment  can tinker with tax rates and/ or overspend (that is, borrow).  Simple and crude weapons in  the battle for growth.  However, investment  decisions are not simple  or uniform in their nature.  Business needs to consider  the reliability and cost of  supplies, and the likelihood  of customers at the right  price, while satisfying a host   that they do not have financial  regulation equivalence in its  place (see passporting and  equivalence primer, opposite).  Non-financial businesses,  which comprise the bulk   of our members  employers,  also have uncertainty over  equivalence; the future form  of environment and labour  laws and practices, and,  more critically, continued  access to overseas supplies  and customers on terms  that enable their UK-based  businesses to thrive.  One flaw in the QE  argument is that too much  simultaneous change  becomes difficult to digest.  The variables in the business  plan become too many. The  best-case and worst-case  scenarios move further apart.  Where you may end up in the  gap between becomes less  certain. A lower cost of debt  only assists to ameliorate the  broader uncertainty, and the  borrower may wish to do no  more than use borrowed funds  to distribute to shareholders,  many of which are not UK  domiciled, thereby passing  on the investment decision  beyond the UK.  Another flaw of QE is that  the buyers of UK debt remain   substantially the long-term  funds, including the defined  benefit (DB) pension funds   of many borrowers. Beyond   a requirement to invest part of  their funds in low-yielding gilts,  these DB funds  mismatch of  assets and liabilities is worsened  by the use of long-dated gilt  yields (whose rates are lowered  by QE) as the discount factor  to value the fund.  The UK has so long a history  of DB pension funds that  even those that closed theirs  years ago still have DB funds,  because we have become very  good at staying alive, and so  the assets accumulated in the  past cannot meet the forecast  liabilities of today.  Tata Steel and BHS may,  in time, become known as  the beginning of the end  of DB funds   the point at  which we began to consider  whether we want to be comfy  pensioners or be an economy  with tax-paying businesses  and employees to fund all that  social infrastructure that helps  us to live so long.  In the meantime, we will  continue to argue that QE may  aid financial market stability,  but it cannot be relied on   to stimulate the commercial  sector, which must reconcile  uncertain times for its  business with an increasing  social welfare liability.  Broader-based stimuli, which  are focused on areas of need,  are required, and for this we  must look to the chancellor  and not the BoE governor,  whose remit is too limited.

Then there is the cost of  financial capital to consider    of which the cost of debt is  a part. The base erosion and profit shifting initiative may  affect the cost of capital as  the benefit of lower interest  rates is eroded by caps on  interest deductibility.  Economic uncertainty And then there are the levels  of uncertainty in the economy:  the Brexit process is hardly  started. Financial institutions  may need to digest the loss of  EU passporting and the risk   { IN DEPTH }  UK QE: investment stimulus,  cheaper corporate financing  or pension deficit booster?  IK O  N  IM  A G  ES      www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer October 2016 The Treasurer  11  { TECHNICAL ROUND-UP }  The US money market fund  (MMF) reforms come into  effect on 15 October. The  Securities and Exchange  Commission Rule 2a-7  defines the quality, maturity  and diversity of investments  allowed in MMFs. A significant  Rule 2a-7 change is the  introduction of variable (or  floating) net asset value funds  for prime, ie non-government,  MMFs. The US Association of  Financial Professionals  2016  liquidity survey found that 62%  of corporates plan to make  changes in how they invest  in prime funds as a result of  these reforms. European MMF  regulatory changes are still a  work in progress, with trialogue  negotiations taking place and  a possibility of seeing the final  text before the end of 2016. The Global Financial Markets  Association has issued  a report, commissioned  from Oliver Wyman, called  Interaction, Coherence, and  Overall Calibration of Post   Crisis Basel Reforms. The report  provides a comprehensive  analysis of the potential costs  of the new Basel standards   on lending and capital markets.  Overall, it estimates that the  median increase in funding  cost for loans is 60-84% bps.

In late August,  the Polish government issued  a three-year ¥3bn bond with  a yield of 3.4%. Panda bonds,  yuan-denominated onshore  bonds issued by foreign  entities, were first permitted   in 2005 and, historically,  issuers have been international  financial institutions. Key  developments in the panda  bond market were outlined  in The Treasurer (July/August  2016, page 32).  { WATCH THIS SPACE }  Regtech   the new fintech? Even while some of us are still   getting our heads around fintech   and what it means in practical   terms for our organisation, there  is a new kid on the block: regtech  (regulatory technology   the use   of technology to deliver solutions   to regulatory requirements).   And, this time, the practical  application may be more apparent   to treasurers.  Firms want to comply with  ever-expanding, but frequently  inconsistent, regulatory requirements;  regulators want to make use of   the information provided   at   present, neither of these things   are happening efficiently.   Furthermore, as all the theories  tell us, data needs to be accurate,  secure, timely and standardised, and  reporting needs to be cost-effective,  flexible and timely to comply with  whatever the regulators require.   This is where regtech comes in.  Regtech solutions are being  designed to provide consistent  interpretation of the rules,  compliance and the automation of  reporting by taking standardised data  from legacy systems and having the  flexibility to manipulate it into the  reporting formats that the various  regulators require. The magic of  regtech (in theory) is that one set   of data can be cut in many different  ways to provide the information  required by different regulators and,  as a result, it helps firms automate  compliance tasks and reduce  operational risks associated with  compliance and reporting obligations.  Ultimately, it might even provide  a solution for the agony for most  corporates that is KYC…  { INTERNATIONAL/BREXIT }  PASSPORTING AND EQUIVALENCE   A PRIMER   The UK has the largest financial services industry in the EU and, post-referendum, the small matter of  how this industry will continue to operate looms large.   Passporting, which is how the industry operates   at present, is a European Economic Area (EEA)   right and, subject to meeting any conditions under   a relevant single market directive (for example,  Solvency II), a firm authorised in an EEA state   is entitled to carry on permitted activities in any  other EEA state by either exercising the right of  establishment (of a branch and/or agents) or  providing cross-border services.   For the UK, one post-Brexit model mooted is the   Norway  model; a member of the European Free  Trade Association and so in the EEA, Norway has   passporting rights in exchange for free movement  of people. This may not be acceptable to the UK for  political reasons (free movement of people being the  major issue for the UK electorate), and so an alternate  solution would be required   perhaps equivalence.  Equivalence rests on ensuring that similar  regulatory outcomes, such as reducing systemic risk  in the financial markets, are achieved irrespective of  regulatory framework. This is the way that countries  such as the US currently  trade  within the EU.  As current UK regulation is based on EU rules,  establishing equivalence should be relatively  straightforward, and the UK would  just  need to  demonstrate that future changes in regulation do not  impact the outcome from a systemic risk perspective.

Working in finance roles at Centrica, I was  responsible for negotiating the project financing  of our operating offshore wind portfolio. From  there, it was a small step into the treasury team. What do you like about treasury? I love working with bright and enthusiastic  people on problems that have a real   value impact on the company. It is a great  combination of analytical problem-solving and  team working. What s the best thing about being a treasurer? Feeling that I make a difference. What s the best thing about being a member  of the ACT? It s the confidence that comes with being  a member of a respected professional  organisation that seeks to lead the development  of the treasury function. Which ACT qualifications do you hold?  I have just got my AMCT and I m taking a  breather while thinking about the MCT. How has your qualification benefited you in  your career so far? It is a great way of getting the theoretical  knowledge to underpin practical experience. It  provides you with confidence to work your way  through problems efficiently and effectively.  What would be your best piece of advice to  someone else considering a career in treasury? Make sure that you get a range of experiences  in your early career so that you can build on  strong foundations. What s your ultimate career goal? To feel that I have used my skills in the best   way I can to add value and make a difference  for myself and the company I work for. If you weren t a corporate treasurer, what  would you be and why? We got our first dog recently, who is a  hyperactive bundle of joy, so perhaps a dog  walker   more exercise and lots of affection.

Before wading into the  specifics of the Apple tax row,  it s important to set the debate  in its proper context. Everyone  knows of the distinction  between tax evasion and   tax avoidance, the one being  illegal and the other… well,  some companies used to argue  that it was a fiduciary duty   to pay as little tax as possible  by whatever legal means   were available.  Many companies did it,  and perhaps oddly, until  quite recently, there wasn t  much of a public outcry  against it. To the contrary,  lots of governments regarded  tolerance of avoidance as a  form of tax competition, a way  of attracting multinationals to  their particular tax jurisdiction.  The public mood has  changed. Particularly since  the financial crisis, voters have  demanded that companies  pay their fair share. Nothing  Apple did was illegal, and  what s more, it was positively  encouraged to act in the way   it did by the Irish government.  Complicating matters further   is the fact that no government  has yet got its head around  how to tax digital income.  In the virtual world, where  precisely the profit is being  generated is frequently a  matter of interpretation.  In any case, Europe s  competition commissioner,  Margrethe Vestager, has  declared that sweetheart   deals of the type Ireland  struck with Apple are a form  of illegal state aid. Notionally,  at least, the EU is still meant  to be a collection of fiscally  independent nations, but  there is no denying the force  of her argument. If you   aspire to a single market,   a harmonised corporate tax  system is the next logical step.  Even so, what she s done  is a clear case of over-reach.  As things stand, there is no  agreement within Europe  to harmonise taxes, and  there is highly unlikely to   be one in any foreseeable  future. The  double Irish  with a Dutch Sandwich   and other tax-avoidance  schemes with no legitimate  business purpose are being  phased out systematically by  the G20, and by new rules  from the Organisation for  Economic Co-operation and  Development, which seem to  command a high degree of  international consensus. The  global machinery for  profit  shifting  will face a new regime  by 2018.  In any case, until the  world s largest economy,   the US, reforms its own  corporate tax system, none   of this is going to get properly  addressed. The US both  imposes one of the highest  rates of corporation tax in the  world, and is extraordinarily  aggressive in attempting to   tax the overseas profits of   its multinationals. Many US  corporations, Apple included,  thereby have a positive  incentive to generate and   keep profits offshore, and   will naturally gravitate to the   lowest tax jurisdictions in   so doing. In Apple s case,   and that of many others,   the situation has become  positively absurd, with the  company borrowing heavily   in the US to finance dividends,  buybacks and investment  alongside an offshore cash  mountain, which had swelled  to more than $200bn at the  last count.  One of the few decent  policies so far announced  by Donald Trump in his  presidential bid is to slash  the corporate tax rate to 15%  and give additional tax breaks  for repatriated profits. This  would neatly solve the Apple   problem , but it would also   be a double blow to the   EU, which might find itself  losing inward investment   and, indeed, overall tax  revenue accordingly.  Vestager s ruling has  brought the prospect of  serious US tax reform that  much closer. It s all very   well trying to make Europe s  internal market into a model  of level playing field fairness,  but there is always going to   be someone attempting to use  tax policy to attract business.  Who knows? Post-Brexit, it  might even be Britain.   The European Commission s competition commissioner says Apple s arrangements   with Ireland amount to state aid, putting the EU at odds with international agreement  JEREMY WARNER { CORPORATE TAX }  Some companies used to argue  that it was a fiduciary duty to   pay as little tax as possible  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer October 2016 The Treasurer  13  COMMENT  SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K  See page 22 for more on international  developments in corporate tax    A new starting point   for treasury success   treasurers.org/success  TREASURY. MORE THAN JUST FINANCE.  Certificate in Treasury Fundamentals (CertTF) The first step to a dynamic and diverse career in global finance  First of our new qualifications  developed in line with the ACT  Competency Framework  Core knowledge and skills for  those at the tactical level or new  to treasury and corporate finance  No entry requirements;  complete online in just   3-6 months  ACT - CertTF_ACT_Oct_16.indd   1 23/09/2016   14:22014_ACT_Oct2016.indd   14 23/09/2016   14:59    recent decades   the independence   that helps prevent governments from  tinkering with monetary policy for  political purposes. Crossing the line  between monetary policy and fiscal policy  seriously risks undermining the hard-  won credibility of central banks. Second,  monetisation of fiscal spending would be  hard to reverse. Government debt is the  primary asset central banks buy and sell  in order to conduct normal operations.  Without the corresponding assets on   the balance sheet, the central bank might  find itself short of assets to sell to the  market in order to mop up any excess  money in the economy in the future.  Third, helicopter money would  seriously risk creating excess inflation.  Arbitrarily increasing demand without  increasing supply is a recipe for higher  prices. History paints a clear picture.  Excessive inflation is far more likely  than excessive deflation. Given a choice  between either today s world of high  employment, slow-ish growth and  low inflation, or a 1970s world of rapid  inflation and high unemployment, the  former is surely better.   Helicopter money will never fly.  Excuse the pun. You might have  heard some commentators talking   about it, but what is it? Helicopter   money was first introduced as a thought  experiment by monetary economist and  Nobel laureate Milton Friedman in 1969  to illustrate the potential inflationary  impacts of monetary policy. Though  Friedman never intended the idea as   a serious policy proposal, worryingly,  helicopter money has become vogue   in some circles as the panacea to deliver  developed world economies from their  growth fatigue and lowflation. But as  Friedman pointed out,  there is no such  thing as a free lunch”.   The principle of helicopter money is  straightforward. The central bank creates  new money, and rather than buying assets  in order to introduce the cash into the  economy, as it normally would, the central  bank transfers the money to economic  agents without exchanging any assets, as   if throwing the money from a helicopter.   Proponents of helicopter money say   the easiest way to pull it off would be   to finance a one-time tax cut or increase  government spending. The government  would act like a middle man, facilitating  the transfer of cash from the central   bank to the private sector. Unlike normal  fiscal expansions, the government need  not issue any bonds with a helicopter  drop. Public deficits and debt would  remain unchanged.   Private businesses and households  would invest and spend the windfall,  stimulating aggregate demand, generating  growth and a rise in inflation. In essence,  the  drop  facilitates a fiscal expansion  that would never have to be paid back.  Sounds like a free lunch? It isn t.   There are several important reasons  why helicopter money is a very bad   idea. First, it would, in effect, re-politicise  central banks that had gained  independence and credibility during   More importantly, extreme policies  should only be considered when other  policy measures are not available or  possible. First and foremost, across the  developed world, monetary policy is  already ultra easy. Thanks to the relaxed  policies of central banks in the US, the  eurozone, Japan and the UK, the rule   of the day in markets is  no news is good  news . Markets are awash with central  bank liquidity and could easily lend  more to the real economy without much  hindrance if economic participants  demanded loans.   Most developed world economies   are growing at trend. For non-monetary  reasons, potential growth has slowed over  the past decade. In the developed world,  ageing populations, gross imbalances  within and between economies, and a  lack of serious supply-side reform are  preventing a stronger expansion. Growth  is less vigorous than before, and in  conjunction with a weaker appetite for  debt after the Lehman lesson, inflationary  pressures have weakened.   Monetary policy cannot, no matter   how drastic the effort, increase the size   of the engine that drives an economy.  Only other non-monetary policy  measures can do that. Central banks  have powerful tools at their disposal.  Used properly, they can help economies  recover smoothly. Used improperly, as  history reminds us, they can devastate  economies. Helicopter money would be   a dangerous step towards the latter.   Central bankers should  not fly helicopters Helicopter money was never intended to be taken as a credible  policy move. So it s worrying that the idea is gaining ground  ECONOMIC TRENDS  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer October 2016 The Treasurer  15  Kallum Pickering is  senior UK economist  at Berenberg Bank  IK O  N  IM  A G  ES Helicopter money would  seriously risk creating  excess inflation    eAFFILIATE MEMBERSHIP A wealth of resources at your fingertips  Your perfect introduction into the ACT and the  treasury profession.  eAffiliate membership gives you access to exclusive online   resources.

The next  generation of  leaders may also  have to become  more visible  externally, and  be more involved  in the regulatory   debate, to ensure that any  potential changes don t wipe  out previous initiatives and  that future changes also  benefit them as a business.   Brexit will undoubtedly  bring change and, therefore,  treasuries and businesses will  need to ensure they become  more efficient and better  adapted to how the UK will  operate outside of the EU.  For future treasury leaders,  the skill that will be critical  to success is leadership.  Indeed, treasurers will need  an acute sense of leadership  in order to develop a vision  and strategy adapted to a new  environment, and to drive  the implementation of small-  and large-scale projects.  Leadership skills take time  and effort to develop, and as  future leaders, young treasury  professionals should start  developing those now.   SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K   www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer October 2016 The Treasurer  17  Brexit will undoubtedly bring change,  and treasuries and businesses will   need to become more efficient  As a young treasury  professional, Brexit  represents the single   most impactful political and  economic event that I have  witnessed. It is also a decision  to leave an arrangement that   I cannot remember not being  part of.   Now this decision has   been taken, we are all trying  to understand what it will  mean for the future. It is a  very difficult assessment  to make, and even after  negotiations start and finish,  we will only realise the long- term impact of Brexit in the  next 10 to 15 years.  By then, the current  treasury leaders will have  been replaced by my  generation of leaders. What  will this mean for us? Will  Brexit be an opportunity,  making us approach business  in new and better ways,  supporting our organisations  better than we do now?  Or will Brexit impact us  negatively and hold us back  on the things we could have  achieved if we had stayed in  the EU?  I think Brexit will impact  the next generation of  treasury leaders positively  and negatively.  Most economists foresee a  slowdown in business trading  and consumption. I m not  an expert in macroeconomy,  but intuitively, it sounds  right. UK businesses may   start to see their revenue  and profit fall, and cut costs  to offset worsened trading  performance. In my view,  there lies the biggest risk  for the next generation of  treasury leaders: as budgets  get squeezed, treasurers will  need to do more with less,  and operate with a smaller  budget, often meaning  smaller teams.  What about the impact of  Brexit on treasury activities  and processes? It is only  speculation at this stage, but  what would be the impact  on FX and interest rate risk,  cash and banking, funding,  compliance, tax and so on?  On the cash management  side, will it become more  difficult or costly to pool cash  cross-border, due to tax or  regulatory changes? Will it  be more difficult to attract  funding from European  investors? Will all the  investment made to comply  with European Market  Infrastructure Regulation be  proven worthwhile?  All these questions cannot  be answered at this stage, and  we will only understand the  full implications of Brexit on  the medium term, but what  seems clear is that life as  young treasury professionals  know it, is likely to change.   Which is where I think the  opportunity lies: change is  good! If the future treasurers   budgets get squeezed and   we need to do more with  less, treasury teams will  have to find ways to become  more efficient and effective,  automate processes, and let  go of processes that do not  create value and consume  resources. As competition  for budget and projects will  increase, only the projects  with the highest rate of return  will be approved, overall  increasing the quality of  standards and processes in  treasury, and in the business.  Treasury teams will be  asked to work with the   business to unlock value from  how the business operates.  For instance, potential  difficulties in pooling or  repatriating cash will actually  force the business and  treasury to look at their cash  and banking strategy, and  design and implement the  best solution for the business.   { FUTURE LEADERS }  COMMENT  AGNES FAVILLIER Will Brexit be an opportunity or a setback for the next  generations of treasury leaders?     18  The Treasurer October 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  SWITCHED-  N  TREASURY    PROFILE  While studying to become a chartered  accountant, it became apparent to Rahul  Daswani that a career in public accounting   or audit was not where he pictured his future  professional life.    Many people enjoy roles like that, looking  at a transaction after the fact, seeing what went  wrong and providing a report,” says Daswani,  who today is group treasury manager    structured finance at Microsoft.  But I wanted to  have a career where I am part of creating those  transactions rather than auditing them. That  was what led me to join a corporate, initially   GE Capital, unlike many of my colleagues.”  Having a customer services and operations  role at that company, Daswani learnt the  fundamentals around operations and finance  that would go on to be his specialised field.  Moving to Citibank, he took on various roles,  including work around credit risk management  and product development.  The core of my  work started to revolve around financial risk  analysis and the study of financial statements,”  he says.  That was when I decided that  corporate finance was the area in which   I would like to develop my career. Following  that path, I moved to Nokia and then, through  acquisition, to Microsoft.”   Technology trends Microsoft has a hybrid structure with most  functions centralised in Redmond, in the US,  while some of the sales support functions  like credit services and structured finance are  located around the world. Being a technology  company, its teams are technically savvy and  use Microsoft s own Azure cloud platform  across all its treasury applications.   In structured finance, the clear goal is to  support the sales organisation to sell more by  addressing credit risk and the liquidity needs of  the company s customers and channel partners.  This is achieved through use of third-party  balance sheets.  When the sales and marketing organisation  requires support, Daswani looks at what the  issues are and how a solution may be possible.   Once we have assessed that there is a realistic  solution possible, my role is that of a project  manager,” he says.  I put all the stakeholders  together, get the product from the banks,  explain it internally to get the appropriate  approvals from legal and accounting, and   then execute the transaction by designing   the operational process. It also means that   I need to train the operational team, who will  continue operating it going forward, so I have  oversight of this.”   Funding feasibility  Structured finance as an entity at Microsoft was  established relatively recently, demonstrating  the company s understanding of the need  for the types of solutions it offers. This is  particularly the case for sales in emerging  markets that may not have the same macro  environment as some of the developed markets.    Credit risk is a very important element, but  we are obviously still exposed to some credit  risk after putting a funding structure in place,”  says Daswani.  We look at whether we have  been able to help our sales organisation by  doing a transaction that they would not have  been able to do without our structure. We also  look at the pricing dynamics to see whether  it is viable or not. In addition to the financial   www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer October 2016 The Treasurer  19  Working in structured finance requires treasury to  be close to and understand the sales and marketing   side of business. Group treasury manager Rahul  Daswani discusses how communication is the key    in making this a success at Microsoft  Words: Ben Poole / Photography: Grant Bishop    20  The Treasurer October 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  RAHUL S TOP TIPS FOR SUCCESS 1   It is important to view banks as your partners and stakeholders. Some  of the best solutions emerge when we actively listen and seek out   creative ideas from our banking partners.” 2   Ongoing education is a really important concept if you are going to be  successful in treasury. My ACT studies have personally helped me to take  concepts and use them in dialogue with stakeholders to properly express   my point of view.” 3   You have to have the latest smartphone. If you don t, then you may not  be as productive, as it really helps with multitasking. And I m not just   saying that to promote Microsoft!” 4   I worked in many different roles before I entered treasury, moving  horizontally to areas such as operations, quality, bank operations, risk  management and business development. That allowed me to learn lots  of different skill sets. This is good to do early in your career before you   have to really specialise. It helped me to get a better perspective of how  companies operate and not have a fixed mindset.”  5   I try not to have a fixed mindset. I want to learn and understand  different points of view. This can be a challenge. In many areas I am quite  opinionated, so sometimes it can be difficult to detach my opinion and   hear someone else s point of view, but it is definitely something that   I always strive to do.”  6   The most difficult question my boss could ask me is one that will  come up during an appraisal: what is the impact you have made? This   is a serious question that requires some introspection. You need to  understand what value you personally bring to the organisation, and   be able to articulate this by describing the challenges you have faced,  the effort you have put in and what that will lead to. It is something you   should always be thinking of.” 7   It can be hard to wind down in the 24/7 work environment, but it is  important to find that time where you can. I like to sit down with my two   young daughters and hear from them about how their day went.”  ROI, this may include looking at the time  you would spend putting the transaction  together, the scalability of the transaction  and how replicable it would be in the  same geography or in another market.”   Enhanced cash flow is a valuable  side effect of some of these structured  transactions, but it is not a key driver.  Growth in revenue and supporting  customers and channel partners remains  the key focus.   I work with a relatively small team  in structured finance, and each of us  contributes to the discussion on how we  can develop the function,” says Daswani.   We look at what we do in one geography  and see how that can translate to other  areas around the world. The fun part  of this role is that we can share strategy  and the way in which we conduct these  transactions. Things will always be  different if you compare Brazil, China,  and Dubai, for example, but if there  is a way to take a successful mode of  operating from one market to another, we  will certainly investigate how to do this.”   Communicating the benefits Like many large global organisations,  Microsoft has a central corporate  plan that is translated down to the  broader field organisation   essentially  a blueprint for success. Whether that  success comes or not depends on how  the company executes the plan.  You  need the resources and also the cutting- edge technology to achieve this group- wide communication,” says Daswani.   We make our own tools like Skype for  Business and SharePoint, so you could say  that we have a built-in advantage here.”  Communication allows everyone to  understand the broader company strategy  and, more importantly, how their team s  goals relate to that broader strategy. Also,  closer ties between the treasury function  and the business allow the value that  treasury adds to the organisation to be  clearly seen, and vice versa.   Treasury is recognised within the  company as a career that requires  specialised skills, and so treasury  qualifications are very important,”   says Daswani, who achieved his AMCT  qualification in 2015.  The company also  encourages us to take on certain roles  outside of treasury in different functions  of the organisation, in order to get a   better understanding of the business.

I was studying for the AMCT some  10 to 12 years after I d graduated. It really  helped me refresh my concepts. There  were also parts of the AMCT that were  completely new to me, so I was absolutely  brought right up to date.”  The fact that he was studying for the  AMCT alongside his corporate treasury  role was also a benefit.  When you study  these concepts, they are very real when  you are also practising them in your day  job,” explains Daswani.  A good example  of this is the capital asset pricing model    you don t actually appreciate that until  you spend some time trying to do things  around it in the real world. Then you  understand how you can make the most  out of it in your day-to-day work.”  Middle East markets Being based in Dubai, Daswani has a  prime view of what is happening in the  financial markets of the Middle East.  Naturally, the topic of oil is never far   from the surface.    The development of financial markets  in the Middle East has frankly been  quite slow; for example, there is no good  bond yield curve,” says Daswani.  One  reason for this is the advantage that the  oil economy has provided to this region.  Higher oil prices provided government  revenues that could then be invested  in a broad range of projects. Today s  lower oil prices are changing the status   quo   but it could actually be helpful  in the development of the financial  markets. Most governments will have to  borrow in the near term to manage their  investments, which could help to boost  the financial markets. Countries such  as the UAE and Saudi Arabia seem to  understand that oil volatility is here to  stay, and are now working on regulation  and policies focused on key strategic goals  to provide a sustainable financial model.”   For treasurers operating in the region,  or looking to expand into it, there are a  couple of points that Daswani highlights  as particularly worthy of attention. The  first relates to receivables and credit  risk management.  This is something  that treasuries operating in the Middle  East really need to own; it is the most  challenging area of business in this  region,” he says.  This is best managed   by treasury, as it allows the treasurer to  make longer-term strategic decisions   that impact the cash flow of the company.  Choosing the structure and the way we  function is vital. In the longer term, this  will reduce risk, allowing for lower loss  provisions to be made that will impact   the profit and loss.”  The second point to note is on funding  and FX. Many countries in the Middle  East, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE,  are linked to the US dollar. This has a  tendency to reduce an FX risk element  in people s minds.  You also need to  remember that the dollar depth in these  markets is fairly limited,” states Daswani.   You may think you are in a dollarised  economy, but then any time you want to  raise any sort of financing, it comes at a  much higher cost, particularly if you want  to do longer-term US dollar financing.  It is very difficult to benchmark pricing,  as the bond markets are not very well  developed and yield curves are not very  well established.”  In this scenario, treasurers need to  spend a lot of time negotiating terms,  conditions and pricing, for example.   It is not as transparent as you would  expect, even if the currency is linked to  the dollar,” says Daswani.  Then there are  certain countries that are not at all linked  to the dollar, which bring their own FX  challenges. This is unique to the Middle  East market.”   All statistics taken from the fiscal year   ending 30 June 2016    22  The Treasurer October 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Cross-border initiatives to close tax loopholes  arguably increase risk for corporates and add   to treasurers  workloads, Michelle Perry reports  The Global TAX RULE BOOK    INSIGHT  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer October 2016 The Treasurer  23  With US multinationals among some  of the biggest culprits for aggressive tax  avoidance, tax authorities there have  updated their own tax laws, introducing  the Foreign Account Tax Compliance  Act (FATCA). The US Treasury has also  implemented new country-by-country   tax (CbC) reporting laws from 1 January  2016. Other OECD countries are due   to introduce CbC reporting   action 13   in the OECD BEPS project   next year.  The UK has already taken action   on CbC reporting, meaning that from  1 January 2016, all UK-headquartered  multinationals and UK subsidiaries  of foreign-owned multinationals are  required to provide HM Revenue &  Customs (HMRC) with information  about global activities, profits and taxes  annually for each tax jurisdiction in which  they do business. The Treasury expects to  raise an extra £5m in tax in the first two  years following the introduction of the  new tax rule, and an extra £10m in the  years thereafter.    Some companies will already be  struggling with it [country-by-country  reporting]. It is a disclosure issue, but  you have to consider your situation  and the picture that it gives. HMRC  thinks it will influence behaviour and  not just disclosure,” says Paul Johns,  director treasury and tax at international  construction services company ISG plc.  Action points The UK government has also introduced  new measures to deal with hybrid  mismatch arrangements   action 2   of the BEPS project   which typically  give rise to a tax deduction without a  corresponding taxable receipt, or more  than one tax deduction for the same  expense. The aim is to eliminate the  unfair tax advantages and to encourage  businesses to adopt less complicated,  cross-border investment structures.  The BEPS guidance on action 4   limiting net deductions for interest to   Modern international business  practices have long outgrown the  global tax rules for which they were   intended. Designed in the 1920s, there is  little doubt that the global tax framework  has exceeded its sell-by date, but forging  international consensus to build a new  one has been no easy task.  Over the past decade, governments  have made attempts to close loopholes   in domestic tax laws. Governments  around the world, including the UK,   have imposed a general anti-avoidance  rule. Last year, UK tax authorities  introduced the diverted profits tax   (DPT)   also dubbed the  Google tax .  Plans for an EU financial transaction   tax (FTT) were introduced in 2013   to  temper irresponsible trading”  following the 2007/8 credit crunch,   but member states are struggling to   reach consensus.   In the background to domestic  attempts, G20 nations realised that unless  an effort was made to work collectively,  multinationals bent on reducing their   tax liability would continue to find ways  to do so.  The push to reform international  tax laws has been somewhat aided and  abetted by the media and a growing  public awareness and interest in  how much tax multinationals like  Amazon, Google and Starbucks pay  in certain jurisdictions. For their part,  multinationals, despite defending their  records and doing nothing illegal, have  realised that their reputations are at risk  and have begun working with authorities  to pay more tax.   Since the 2007/8 financial crisis, the  trust in institutions, both government  and business, has been eroded,” says  James Lockyer, development director  at the ACT.  People have looked for  someone to blame, and tax is the  one issue companies have not been  particularly transparent about.”  With a growing political will to tackle  tax avoidance, three years ago, G20  governments and the Organisation  of Economic Co-operation and  Development (OECD) launched the base  erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project  with the aim of curtailing aggressive tax  avoidance. The OECD has produced a  15-point BEPS action plan to which, as    of July 2016, 85 OECD members have  signed. G20 finance ministers, including  then UK chancellor George Osborne,  endorsed all 15 action points.   The OECD has created a menu so  that governments can pick and choose  without being seen as anti-business. It  allows governments to change tax laws  relatively uncontroversially. And OECD  countries mostly have an interest in  cooperating on this,” says John Cullinane,  tax policy director at the Chartered  Institute of Taxation.  The temptation to act independently  of these kinds of initiatives can be hard  to resist. Last month, the European  Commission said Ireland must recover  €13bn from Apple, a sum it regards as tax  avoidance. This kind of breaking ranks is  clearly problematic, but the Commission  says Apple s arrangements with Ireland  amount to state aid. And yet Ireland,   the Netherlands and Luxembourg   have already agreed separately to   close loopholes in their corporate   tax arrangements.  Despite the desire to stem the tax  leakage from government treasuries, the  fall in tax income cannot be entirely put  at the door of multinationals  creative  tax planning. Since the financial crisis,  economic growth has fallen and, with it,  the amount of tax due. So governments  have been trying to balance the need to  ensure they receive the correct amount  of tax due, while also making themselves  attractive to investment. Many  governments, including the UK, have  done this by reducing their corporate   tax rates, as well as attempting to curb   tax avoidance.    Some countries are looking to lower  their corporate tax rate, but broaden the  tax base. While wanting to tighten tax   law to reduce avoidance, countries are  trying to make themselves seem attractive  places to invest in,” says Matthew  Rose, vice president   tax at Seadrill  Management Ltd.   The OECD has created a menu so that  governments can choose without being seen  as anti-business. It allows governments to  change tax laws relatively uncontroversially”    What is important to note is that   few of the measures in the OECD BEPS  project are entirely new to the UK tax  system. Treasurers and heads of tax at  multinationals will already be familiar  with many of these types of taxes, such  as withholding tax (WHT) and transfer  pricing rules.  On BEPS action point 6 on treaty  abuse relating to royalty WHT, the UK  has announced its adoption of three  measures. The first is an anti-abuse  measure with immediate effect, to deny  treaty benefits when royalty payments are  routed through a connected company in a  treaty jurisdiction to gain a tax advantage.   The other two measures extend the  scope of the WHT regime for royalties  to include intangible assets   such as  trademarks and brand names. The  regime will also apply to royalty payments  connected with the activities of a UK  permanent establishment of an   overseas company.  The DPT, which is similar to BEPS  action 13, is a new tax charged at 25% on  profits that are considered to be artificially  diverted from the UK to a related company  with a low tax rate. HMRC updated tax  law on this point last year.   The DPT forces everyone to consider  their group transactions and in particular  the transfer pricing position, along with  any risks and whether they need to notify  HMRC. It s not inconsistent with the  substance of BEPS initiatives, but it is  slightly different,” Rose says.  Implementation Despite the familiarity with the concept  of certain types of tax, the workload is not  to be underestimated.  It s a mammoth  task. All of these new regulatory issues  that affect treasury involve data capture  and you have to change your systems to  manage that,” Johns says.  24  The Treasurer October 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  a percentage of a company s earnings  before interest, taxes, depreciation and  amortisation (EBITDA) is causing slightly  more consternation than other OECD  actions. To meet this, the UK would  need to introduce a new general rule for  restricting interest, which would be a major  change to the UK corporate tax regime, but  it also runs the risk of capturing companies  that do not pose a risk of avoiding tax by  benefiting from the measure.  In its latest submission to the  government s consultation on capping   tax relief on interest on debt, the ACT  says:  BEPS is a poorly targeted tool  intended to affect global multinationals,  but, in fact affecting purely domestic  businesses, which have a history of  using debt capital to achieve growth and  government objectives for development   of UK infrastructure.”  One of the biggest concerns of BEPS is  that companies in multinational groups  are increasingly using leverage and  interest to avoid tax. However, more often  than not, the choice between debt and  equity financing within a multinational  group are commercial decisions rarely  based on pure tax considerations, but  on legal requirements, regulatory  constraints, contractual limitations   and foreign currency implications.  Any company that is thinly capitalised  will be heavily impacted by the new rule  on capping relief, on interest on debt.   SUPPLY CHAIN IMPACT  The OECD BEPS initiative,  and in particular country- by-country (CbC) reporting,  is likely to have an impact  on some companies    supply chains given that  most of the action points  required by the BEPS  project involve greater  transparency through  increased disclosure.  What this means   in practice is that tax  authorities around the  world will be able to see  exactly where a company  makes its profits, how much  tax it is paying in each   country versus profits  made, and how much  business activity there is   in a particular jurisdiction.  Shared service centres  (SSCs) in particular are  likely to come in for closer  scrutiny by authorities.  Over the past two decades,  SSCs have become a useful  tool in better management  of the supply chain. Groups  have sought to centralise  sales, procurement or  finance, for example, to  reduce duplication and  increase efficiency through  reorganising resources and   sharing investments  between business units.  Often, reducing a group s  tax liability   not necessarily  corporate tax, but perhaps  personal taxes   has been   a factor in this decision- making process. Such a  decision may have been  made for clear commercial  reasons, but with CbC  reporting, the intracompany  charges will be magnified.   If a business unit were   to show big profits but   little activity, then tax  authorities will likely  question the structure.  A big concern for treasurers  is that there will be little  consistency in interpretation,  application or in the timing  of BEPS measures across  OECD countries  It is, however, doubtful there are many  companies that are accruing so much  interest on debt that it is taking up all   of their profits. And if that were the case,  experts say, those companies are very  likely facing serious problems anyway.  It is worth noting that the amount of  tax planning in respect of debt is very  different in today s world of record low  interest rates compared with that of more  than a decade ago when interest rates  were in double digits. The opportunities  and benefits of structuring debt based on  reducing tax through interest relief are far  fewer in an environment of historically  low interest rates.  The current time frame for the UK   to introduce the measure is April 2017     a plan that many are less than happy  about. The ACT has expressed caution  at the planned timing, because it  would mean that the UK would be  an  early adopter” of the tax rule,  which  remains under development, and before  understanding how trading partners  intend to implement the initiative”.  The OECD guidance includes  the option for countries to consider  introducing a group ratio rule in  combination with the fixed ratio rule.  Depending on the design of such a rule,  it could ensure that no restriction arises  for domestic groups and stand-alone  companies in respect of interest paid   to third parties.    www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer October 2016 The Treasurer  25  The new tax rules will involve a  significant amount of work for treasurers  in terms of compliance and reporting, and  even though some BEPS measures are still  under consultation, the direction of travel  is clear so treasurers and tax teams can get  to work in preparation for what is likely  to come.    My view is that the response to BEPS  initiatives may be that many authorities  will introduce strong tax laws that could  be perceived as taking a sledgehammer   to crack a nut,” says Rose, who is also   a former treasurer and head of tax at   Royal Mail.   What companies would  ideally like is as much advance  clarity on proposed legislation  as possible to give time to  restructure or reorganise  transactions where necessary”  A big concern for treasurers in general  is that there will be little consistency   in interpretation, application or in   the timing of BEPS measures across  OECD countries.    What companies would ideally like  is as much advance clarity on proposed  legislation as possible to give time to  restructure or reorganise transactions  where necessary. Tax authorities need to  think about the impacts on companies,  but also take into account public  perception for action on tax. However,  for multinational groups operating in  many countries that may introduce a   variety of rules at different times, it could  result in there not being enough time to  restructure everywhere. That s clearly not  helpful,” Rose says.  Governments are treading a fine line in  their desire to increase their tax income,  but avoid penalising legitimate business  practices and simultaneously ensure they  remain attractive to inward investment. It  is a balancing act, especially considering  all the other huge political and economic  decisions facing business over the next  few years.

While cash continued to be  used for 48% of transactions, other  payment methods   such as debit cards  (26%), direct debit (10%) and credit  cards (6%)   together represented more  than half of transactions. This trend   is expected to continue: the Payments  Council (relaunched as Payments UK   in June 2015) also predicted that by   2024, only 34% of consumer payments  will be made in cash.  Meanwhile, the area of payments is  evolving rapidly. From mobile payments  to blockchain, new technology is  reshaping the way that people and  businesses transfer money. While some  of these developments are already in  use, others are more nascent. Innovation  is also breathing new life into traditional  payment instruments, from the launch   of polymer notes to the development   of mobile cheque-imaging services.   Embracing revolution Against this backdrop, to what extent  are treasurers taking advantage of the  opportunities currently presented by   the changing payments landscape?    From a business perspective, we  are seeing corporates reap the benefits  from innovations like contactless cards  and Faster Payments, especially where  they deal with consumers directly,”  comments Natalie Willems-Rosman,  head of payables and receivables,  GTS EMEA, Bank of America Merrill  Lynch.  However, in general, there is  still ground to cover when it comes  to both consumers and businesses  fully embracing the benefits new  technologies have to offer.”  Areas of focus include B2B payment  systems, while debate continues about    www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer October 2016 The Treasurer  29  the role that distributed technology  could play in correspondent banking.  In more established developments,  treasurers should also be asking  whether they can leverage the UK Faster  Payments Scheme more effectively.  Faster Payments Launched in 2008, Faster Payments  was one of the world s first real-time  24/7 electronic payments schemes. Last  year, it processed 1.24 billion payment  transactions with a value of £1,104bn.  Mike Banyard, head of development  for Faster Payments Scheme Ltd, says  there are some interesting use cases  for Faster Payments that are driving  tangible benefits to businesses and their  customers:  From insurance companies  seeing a competitive advantage by being  able to settle claims immediately (no  more waiting for the cheque to arrive)  through to consumer-lending firms  being able to deliver the proceeds of   a loan request within minutes, or firms  that are moving to  just in time  stock  management   ordering and paying  for goods only when they actually need  them,” he says.  MEANS ofEXCHANGE  Payments technology is fruitful territory  for innovation, and new solutions add  speed and efficiency, but a genuinely  revolutionary approach is some way off.  Rebecca Brace looks at developments   There is still ground to cover when it comes to  both consumers and businesses fully embracing  the benefits new technologies have to offer”  MANAGEMENT    30  The Treasurer October 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  These  advantages  are not  always fully  realised.   For many  corporates   in the UK, up until  now, Faster Payments   has mainly been seen as a  get out  of jail  card to play in exceptional  circumstances, such as a delay in payroll  or supplier payment submissions,” says  Banyard.  This has been, at least in  part, because taking advantage of the  immediacy of such payments could  require changes in business processes,  IT systems and service propositions.”  B2B payment systems B2B payment systems represent another  interesting area of development.   Carl Sharman, senior director in  Deloitte s Financial Advisory  practice, notes that there are three  types of B2B payment systems:  •  Those that replace the   traditional role of the bank   (ie M-Pesa);  • Those that work with banks to  provide a service that banks can  offer to their own customers (ie  mobile payments and non-financial  counterparties, prepaid cards, Faster  Payments); and   • Those that use the automated  clearing house (ACH) system to  process payments (ie supply chain  finance multi-bank platforms, such   as Orbian and GT Nexus).  According to Sharman, M-Pesa is the  benchmark for bank disintermediation.  However, he questions whether this  scheme has global scale, having evolved  to fill a need where the existing bank  infrastructure was poor.   The fastest growth potential is in  supply chain financing intermediaries  that facilitate dynamic payments  discounting on a large scale through   multi-bank platforming, as  part of a wider working capital   management programme,”   he says.    Already some huge  multinationals are choosing  these platforms over single-  bank proprietary systems.”  Distributed ledger technology The possible applications of this  technology are certainly interesting.   Distributed ledger has great  potential to bring enhanced features  to the payments landscape,” says  Matthew Davies, co-head of product  management, GTS EMEA at Bank  of America Merrill Lynch.  Some of  these include the ability to carry more  data and, therefore, make it easier for  organisations to reconcile payment  information and use data effectively.”  Davies adds that distributed ledger  technology allows for transactions to  be settled more quickly and around  the clock, and more easily across  geographies.  These features could  potentially be very beneficial for  corporates and can open up all sorts   of opportunities off the back of having  real-time payment confirmations   across the globe, such as entering     new markets.” However, it is important to   note that these benefits may not  materialise any time soon   despite  significant attention given to this   topic in the past couple of years. As  Willems-Rosman says:  It will take time  before we have a clear view of how new  technologies, such as blockchain, could  be fully embedded in the payments  landscape, as the industry is focusing   on how they can be delivered in a  secure, tested and integrated way.”   Everyone gets very excited about  blockchain, but it s interesting to cut  through the hype,” comments Ruth  Wandhöfer, global head regulatory  and market strategy, treasury and  trade solutions, at Citi.  There are a  lot of areas where people are probably  under the impression that blockchain  technology is already extensively being  used in financial services to transfer  financial assets. This is really not the  case   apart from Bitcoin.”  She adds:  Various players in the  blockchain space have reassessed  their proposition and begun to embed  features of this innovative technology,   such as distributed consensus  mechanisms, rather than  replacing existing financial  market infrastructures and  processes altogether, for  example, in the correspondent   banking space.”  Gaining ground Much is changing   but how significant  are these new developments compared  with traditional payment methods?   Sharman argues that technology  such as UK Faster Payments and  mobile payments represent evolution  rather than revolution.  The same  single-ledger banking system applies  (ACH)   but these recent developments  in technology enhance the customer  experience, making it faster and easier  to access it,” he explains.    For example, Faster Payments  artificially speeds it up, as banks take   on the risk through collateralisation.  So if a payment fails in the traditional  clearing process, the claim is against  the bank that has guaranteed it. Hence,  there are upper limits on transaction  amounts to match the banks  collective  appetite for risk.”  Sharman notes that mobile and  internet systems, such as PayPal  and Paym, add a layer of security by   attaching email addresses and  mobile numbers to bank  details, or by using new  passwords. This enables   consumers to access their  accounts in a different way.   Consumers get better access  to their accounts to pay and  receive cash, but essentially  with upper limits dependent  on the risk the new provider(s)  is prepared to take,” he says.  Blockchain technology, in  comparison, offers a genuine  revolution by promising a  new way of accessing value  exchange. However, no system  is infallible. What is more,  banks  have a very strong    The fastest growth potential is in supply chain  financing intermediaries that facilitate dynamic  payments discounting on a large scale   through multi-bank platforming”    payments will materialise,” he  says.  Opinions differ on when  this will become a reality, but  commercial pressures will push  this along faster than we might  expect, certainly a lot faster  than SEPA implementation.”  At the same time, the UK s  Payment Systems Regulator is  currently consulting on draft  guidance, which looks at how   access is given to certain regulated  payment systems.  The consultation  is looking at what users want, how  access to markets can be improved,  whether this needs to be done through  collaboration or competition between  people, and how best to enable that,”  explains Shaun Kennedy, group  treasurer of Affinity Water.  I think we ll  come through this consultation with a  definite plan for the UK and hopefully  some innovation will come to the fore.”  Payments technology is evolving  rapidly. Some of the most significant  changes currently being developed may  take many years to come to fruition. In  the meantime, however, there are plenty  of opportunities for treasurers to gain  a greater understanding of new and  recent developments, and explore how  these can be used to their advantage.   Rebecca Brace is a  freelance journalist  specialising in  corporate treasury  and banking   www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer October 2016 The Treasurer  31  CUSTOMER CHOICE  Shaun  Kennedy,  group  treasurer    of Affinity Water, says   the utility offers up   all payment methods  regardless of how long  they have been in use.  It s  really important not just to  think about people who ve  got mobiles and are using  all the latest gadgets and  apps, but also to make sure  that the payment systems  continue to serve those  who don t have access to,  or feel comfortable using,  the latest technology,”   he says.  Kennedy notes that   there has been a lot of  innovation around mobile  payments in emerging  economies, such as Africa  and China, which have  skipped ahead of the UK in  some ways.  WeChat, for  example, is fundamentally  a messaging service, but   the way people are   using that to make  payments to each other   is really interesting.”  For Affinity Water,  meanwhile, some of   the most interesting  developments include  those relating to direct  debits.  Direct debit has  been around for nearly   50 years, but some  developments may be  happening here, too,”   says Kennedy.  If I m a  customer who gets paid   on an ad hoc basis, you  might take the direct debit,  but I might not have any  money that day   so the  direct debit will bounce.  One possibility is for the  concept of Request to   Pay. A company sends   me a request for £30 for  my water bill that month  and I can say: actually,   I m not going to accept   it today, but in two days   time, when I know I ve got   money, I ll release the  payment. That idea has  been talked about for a  while and will hopefully  become a reality.”  At the same time, the  ability to include more  detailed information   could make it easier for  companies to match up  incoming payments with  the relevant bills.  As a  water company, we get  payments from lots of  people, but we don t  always know what those  payments are for, because  not everyone includes   their account reference,”  Kennedy explains.  The  ability to interact more  through the payments  system would be useful    for example, by allowing  customers to send a  picture of the water bill  alongside the payment.   I think it will be interesting  to see how that develops  going forward.”  incentive to collaborate” because of the  potential costs they could face as a result  of disintermediation, Sharman argues.   My hunch is that non-financial  applications will lead the way    documentation exchange, for example,”  says Sharman.  Once these are  considered foolproof, the step can be  taken towards value exchange. However,  early adopters will be brave. It would  take a move into commercial  payments to make it worthwhile  on scale, and the levels  of trust needed are  huge. And as the  cost of accessing  traditional  (evolutionary)  methods erodes, then  the touted benefits  may be significantly  smaller by the time  the technology is  considered viable.”  Regulatory developments Meanwhile, regulatory  developments, such as the  revised Payment Services  Directive (PSD2) may  support further innovation in  payments.  PSD2 and changes  in interchange fees will further  promote change and demand  for real-time services   and  the PSD2 may support the  move away from cards for some types of  payment,” comments Banyard.  There   could also be significant implications  for the use of direct debits in future  as end users seek greater real-time  control over their finances.”  The industry is currently working  on an enhanced common ISO 20022  standard, which is specifically  designed to handle real-time   payments, he notes.

The average cash conversion cycle  (CCC) of the 960 companies surveyed  shrank 1.7% year-on-year as receivables  and payables both improved.  However, some causes for concern  remain. Revenues came at a higher cost  than in 2014, with gross margins slipping  an average of 13.8%. The earnings before  interest and taxes margin fell steeply  (-22.1%), and debt rose 8.3%. There was a  2.9% increase in cash on hand, outpacing  revenue growth (+2%) and Europe s   GDP (+1.9%).  One trillion on the table Net working capital improved relative  to revenue growth, only 0.2% against  2% revenue. However, few companies  have focused steadily on improving their  working capital management. Overall,  Europe s largest and most sophisticated  companies still have an opportunity to  release nearly one trillion euros (€981bn)  now tied up in working capital, the  equivalent of 6.7% of European GDP  (€4.63 trillion). Better management   could represent significant benefits in  each area of working capital (payables,  €349bn; inventory, €328bn; and  receivables, €304bn).  Despite the good macroeconomic  news, only 13.2% of the companies  surveyed managed to sustain  improvement in their CCC for three  years in a row. Indeed, 9% suffered  deteriorating CCC performance for three  years running. Nor did cash conversion  efficiency (CCE, which measures   SCORECARD METHODOLOGY  REL s Working Capital Survey calculates  working capital performance based on the  latest publicly available annual financial  statements of the largest listed non- financial companies with headquarters   in Europe. This year, the survey included  960 companies. The survey takes an  industry-based approach to ranking  companies according to the four   key working capital metrics: days   sales outstanding (DSO), days inventory  outstanding (DIO), days payable  outstanding (DPO) and cash conversion  cycle (CCC). For each industry, the  companies are ranked according to   overall CCC, and the top three and   bottom three performers are listed   in the scorecard.  Companies are classified according   to the industry classification system   and data sourced from FactSet. For  purposes of the survey and presenting  results, we have grouped certain  industries together. Historical  comparisons within the survey are   made on a like-for-like basis. Where  off-balance sheet arrangements are   used by the company, adjustments   have been made to the data in order   to provide true, consistent and  comparable figures.  Days sales outstanding (DSO) =   accounts receivable/(one-day revenue)    Year-end trade receivables net of   allowance for doubtful accounts,   divided by one day of average revenue     A decrease in DSO represents an  improvement, an increase, a deterioration  Days inventory outstanding (DIO) =  inventory/(one-day cost of goods   sold (COGS))    Year-end inventory balance divided    by average days COGS    A decrease is an improvement,    an increase, a deterioration  Days payable outstanding (DPO) =  accounts payable/(one-day COGS)    Year-end trade accounts payable balance   divided by average days COGS    An increase in DPO represents an   improvement, a decrease,  a deterioration  Cash conversion cycle  (CCC) = (DSO + DIO - DPO)    Year-end DSO + DIO -    DPO performance (in  days, as calculated above)     The lower the number   of days, the better  operating cash flow/revenue) improve  much: CCE showed only marginal  improvement for the third time round.  Despite those slight gains, CCE is still  down 3.4% from where it was five years  ago, and the average European firm has  yet to recover to its 2009 position.  Ultra-low interest rates (0.6%) on   loans from the European Central Bank  (ECB) are a key cause of their distraction.   Total indebtedness has increased from   €2.26 trillion to €3.13 trillion since 2010;  and, in the past year alone, has risen by  8.3% as companies have taken advantage  of the ECB s nearly free money.  Much of this money went either into  capital expenditures, M&As or dividend  payments. Capex grew by 5% (€28bn)  in 2015, particularly in biotechnology  (+78%) and internet software and services  (+54%), although there were declines in  energy services and equipment (-23%),  and metals and mining (-14%). M&As  were at a record high, particularly in the  pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and  consumer goods sectors. Dividend payouts  grew by 5% year-on-year, increasing  substantially in pharmaceuticals,  telecommunications and beverages, and  continuing a seven-year growth streak.

High inventory levels and less  advantageous customer and supplier  payment terms have given Sweden and  Finland the highest CCC in Europe.  It s worth noting that the regional best  performers have all improved in recent  years. Belgian companies, for instance,  saw their CCC rise to -9 days from -3,  and the Spanish CCC two-day gain to  9 from 11 days. Overall, only four of the  18 countries tracked by REL improved  their CCC over the past five years: France,  Greece, Portugal and Spain. This is  cause for concern, as it appears that  these countries have focused on working  capital only once they were in the midst   Companies currently hold the rest of  the cash, the equivalent of 11% of revenue.  They have a total of €833bn in cash on  hand, but the holdings are far from evenly  distributed: just nine companies account  for €164bn, 20% of the total.  But as the many US companies that  have also piled on low interest debt this  year are learning, even nearly free money  comes at a price. European companies  that added 50% or more to their debt in  2015 suffered a 20% increase in their CCC.  Slower conversion and an upward trend  in total debt (with above-average overall  debt and lower average cash on hand for  these companies) suggest that European  companies have made themselves much  more vulnerable in the event of a major  shock or disruption to their business.  Countries and sectors swing further The 1.7% average improvement of all the  companies surveyed encompasses much  sharper positive and negative sectoral and  regional swings.  Industry leaders included companies  in marine shipping, which saw their CCC  improve to -9 days in 2015 from -1 day;  internet software and services, which rose  to -5 days from 4 days; and household and  personal care, which climbed to 2 days  from 6 days. The most dramatic negative  changes were suffered by companies  in internet and catalogue retail, which  fell to -3 days from -11 days; wireless  telecommunications, which dropped   to -75 days from -91 days; and wholesale  distribution, which lost two days, rising  to 14 from 12 days. The largest nominal  loss was semiconductors and equipment,  which added 17 days to its CCC total,  bloating to 157 days from 140.  Country performance also varied  dramatically. Belgian companies in the  ranking topped the list for CCC with -9  days, a six-day improvement in overall  performance in 2015, followed by Spain  (9 days) and Portugal (10 days). CCC  stragglers include Finland (77 days),  Sweden (72 days) and Ireland (57 days).  Both Belgium and Spain have longer  payment terms with suppliers.

What should companies expect this year?  The likeliest scenario is for more CCC  improvement. As we forecast in 2015, we  believe that the trend towards faster cash  conversion will continue. However, if, as  expected, many of the largest European  companies continue to gorge on debt,  their overall risks will increase.  Improving working capital practices is  always a good idea, but with the ongoing  uncertainty that seems likely to follow  the Brexit crisis, and no guarantee that  interest rates will remain low, 2016 may  be a particularly opportune time for  companies to reduce borrowing and  concentrate on generating cash through  tighter working capital management.  At the very least, it seems prudent  to strengthen internal processes and  policies around working capital to enable  sustainable cash-flow improvement and to  minimise the cash impact of any potential  deterioration in trading conditions.   What should companies expect this year? The  likeliest scenario is for more CCC improvement    34  The Treasurer October 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Since the global financial crisis, corporates have amassed cash in the billions.   Are they being recklessly prudent or is caution now a fundamental part of the   business landscape? Paul Cowdell takes a closer look   Many financial managers appear  to be sitting behind a wall of cash. Ostensibly, this is a necessary  precaution for the benefit of their  organisations in an uncertain  environment. It is also a very expensive  precaution, one that contradicts  traditional ideas about returning   surplus cash to shareholders if there   are no positive net present value (NPV)  projects available.  Agency theory suggests that some  managers are tempted to be  recklessly  prudent  or overly cautious for career or  personal reasons, ahead of the interests  of shareholders. But what s the truth of  the matter?  Cash mountain origins Cash hoarding by companies seems   to have started around the year 2000,  which coincides with the bursting of   the dotcom bubble.   In the run-up to the millennium,  during a boom in IT shares, investors  began to take a  this time it s different   stance, apparently persuaded that  traditional business valuation  fundamentals had ceased to apply.   Stock markets worldwide peaked in the  wake of the dotcom experience. Then,   in early 2000, reality reasserted itself   and technology stocks lost about 60%   of their value. This was accompanied by  a decline in stock markets worldwide, as  illustrated by the FTSE 100, which traded  at 6930 towards the end of 1999 and  today, almost 17 years later, is currently  still trading below that figure.  Where are we now? Traditionally, treasurers would manage  liquidity on the debt side by techniques  such as revolving credit facilities (RCFs).   CASH STASH However, since the global financial   crisis and the development of Basel III,   RCFs are not as attractive to banks.  Consequently, corporate treasurers who  can t offer attractive ancillary business  face a combination of reduced availability  and/or higher interest and fees for RCFs.  Hence, many treasurers now manage  liquidity via a combination of cash   and debt.   So, while some may argue that  treasurers tend towards being overly  cautious, that caution is a product of  today s business environment. Since  the global financial crisis, treasurers  have concluded that they cannot always  rely on the bank facilities being there  when they need them. Thus, corporates  worldwide continue to build up large  cash balances.   The US has some striking examples.  US businesses collectively have currently  amassed around $1,900bn in cash   on their balance sheets. Specific  examples include:  • Alphabet, Google s parent company,   which has on its balance sheet cash  amounting to $80bn, around 16% of its  total market capitalisation. The $80bn  is enough to fund the purchase of a  controlling interest in Goldman Sachs  or American Express.   • General Motors has cash holdings  amounting to nearly half its market  value, and Apple s balances are almost   a third of its market value.   What s the future Is this situation likely to change in the  near future? In a word, no. A survey by  the Association of Financial Professionals  shows that the recent trend and forecast  trend is for cash balances to increase.  Change   in cash   holdings  Jul 16 Apr 16 Jan 16 Oct 15  (Over the  past year)     +14 +10 +15 +13  Expected  change   (during  current   quarter)  +16 +7  -1 +8  The indicators measure recent and  anticipated changes in corporate cash  balances by calculating the percentage of  survey respondents reporting an increase  (or expected increase) in cash holdings  minus the percentage reporting a decline  (or expected decline). The survey s  authors comment:  Declining indicators  are indicative of increasingly confident  businesses. Conversely, rising indicators  suggest growing pessimism.”   So what does this say about traditional  financial theory? According to agency theory,  the build-up of cash balances serves to:  Corporate treasurers who can t offer  attractive ancillary business face a  combination of reduced availability   and/or higher interest and fees for RCFs  SOURCE: AFP CORPORATE CASH INDICATORS JULY 2016 (WWW.AFPONLINE.ORG/ PUBLICATIONS-DATA-TOOLS/DATA-TOOLS/AFP-CORPORATE-CASH-INDICATORS)     www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer October 2016 The Treasurer  35  to back that  sentiment. But  not all investors  appear happy   about Apple s cash mountain, however.  Activist investors David Einhorn and  Carl Icahn have each campaigned at  times in the past for Apple to return cash  to shareholders. Einhorn even went so   far as to take legal action in 2013.  Investor sentiment is clearly divided  on this issue, and much depends on the  industry, and on investor confidence in  the management.  Research by Rohan Williamson and  Lee Pinkowitz, quoted in Davidson s  article, suggests that, while in some  industries investors support the build-up  of cash balances, in other sectors, such as  defence and coal, investors valued every  $1 of stockpile at a mere 40 cents.  Cost of carry At face value, it makes little sense to   hold cash balances and simultaneously  have borrowings, as the cost of carry   will inevitably work against the company,   and that value destruction effect will  be even greater if, as has been   suggested, banks begin to  charge negative interest rates   on them. However, there are   two possible explanations of this   apparent anomaly.  With Apple, for instance, the  vast majority of cash is held   outside the US and beyond the reach  of the Internal Revenue Service.    If Apple repatriated the cash to the  US, under current tax law, which may  change, it would have to pay about  35% in tax. So long as the US corporate  tax law remains unchanged, it is more  economical for Apple to borrow any  money it distributes to shareholders  from US sources than to use its overseas  cash balances. In 2014, Apple issued a  $17bn bond to fund its buyback, rather  than depleting its cash balances.  It s not just tax that has an impact.  The other advantage of cash mountains  that can be cited to outweigh the cost of  carry argument is the buffer they provide  against economic turbulence.   As Ben Wright, writing in The  Telegraph, put it:  The scars from the  credit crunch   when banks suddenly  pulled their credit lines   are even  fresher [than the dotcom crash]. A   whole host of companies have since  learnt that they can t necessarily rely   on the banks being there when they  need them and have increased their   own balances accordingly.”2  Bearing all this in mind, and as John  Grout, the ACT s former policy and  technical director, said when asked  about his primary advice for treasurers,  it may be simply that the answer lies in  the old edict:  fund early and fund long”.  The rise of corporate cash balances has  not changed traditional financial theory,  but it does add extra dimensions and  nuances that should be considered on   a case-by-case basis.   • mask poor decision-making on the  part of a manager;  • protect managers  jobs; and  • avoid scrutiny by external lenders    of any  pet projects .  However, given concerns about  availability of finance when needed,  holding cash should reduce the danger   of  costs of financial distress  or having   to dispose of assets at fire sale values.   Returning surplus cash  Another traditional tenet of finance  theory is that if there are no positive NPV  projects available, surplus cash should  be returned to shareholders as holding  cash, especially in the current low or  negative interest rate environment, which  will generate far lower returns than the  company weighted average cost of capital.   However, today the conclusion is not so  clear-cut. Holding cash means that it is  possible to make opportunistic takeover  bids or exploit a major new investment  opportunity. For IT companies,  acquisitions are seen as an essential  means of keeping abreast of changes   in technology and customer preferences.  Indeed, it is said that Google undertakes  an average of one acquisition a week.   To quote Adam Davidson in The New  York Times Magazine:  For a company  such as Google, this means that  investors are behaving as if they trust the  executives in these industries, like Larry  Page of Alphabet, to be smarter about  using that money [ie the cash balances]  than the investors themselves could be.” 1   Berkshire Hathaway s $1bn investment  in Apple earlier this year would appear   MANAGEMENT  1 www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/magazine/why-are- corporations-hoarding-trillions.html?mwrsm=Email   2 www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/11375709/ Apple-might-need-to-save-its-178bn-cash-pile-for-  the-next-rainy-day.html   Paul Cowdell is  associate lecturer   at Sheffield   Hallam University    36  The Treasurer October 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Clearing and settlement systems around the world are becoming faster,   but research shows that approaches vary.

As Payments Canada moves forward  with its modernisation strategy, the  research looked at how 27 jurisdictions  compared to Canada in their response  to new technologies, evolving user  demands and a changing regulatory  landscape. The research, Clearing and  Settlement Systems from Around the  World: A Qualitative Analysis, compared  timeliness, access, functionality,  interoperability and risk management   in payment systems.   The world is getting faster A major driver for modernisation around  the world is the push for faster retail  payments systems that deliver funds   to the end user in a timely manner.   Most large-value payments systems  (LVPS) around the world have already  developed real-time processing, but   some retail systems are lagging behind.  For example, the decision to implement  the UK s Faster Payments Scheme  (FPS) was made by the government  after a review of the payments system s  inefficiencies, including the need for  faster access. FPS is available day and  night all year to support the demands   of personal and business customers to  move money quickly.  The FPS is an example of an Expedited  Retail Payment System (ERPS), which  provide interbank clearing and are  typically integrated into large-value  systems for settlement. These kinds  of systems are developed, under  construction or planned in 17 of the   27 jurisdictions analysed.  Jurisdictions are also enhancing the  timeliness of their retail batch-processing  systems by adding intraday clearing  and settlement. As a result, all but three  countries (Canada, Egypt and Israel) MOST DATA ARE FROM THE COMMITTEE ON PAYMENTS AND MARKET INFRASTRUCTURES, SEPTEMBER 2015     www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer October 2016 The Treasurer  37  of Canada research. Payment operators  are leveraging centralised architecture to  implement advanced system capabilities.  We found higher functionality in  centralised retail systems, including the  ability to sort, validate, route payment  batches to financial institutions and  interact with other systems. For example,  if the system can scan payments for fraud  and errors, the participants don t have to.   Interoperability Systems are becoming more  interoperable. There is a trend among  the countries studied to move towards  more interoperability between systems,  which enables automation. For example,  TARGET2 in Europe has one of the most  interoperable systems identified in the  research, connecting to 83 ancillary  payment and security systems, and  supporting more than 2,000 direct  participants across 23 jurisdictions.   The research also found that  ISO 20022, a messaging standard,  is becoming the most prominent  international standard for electronic  payment messages. ISO 20022 will help  businesses and financial institutions  move away from paper by creating   the conditions for data-rich electronic  payments. ISO 20022, which can be  found in EU countries, Japan and New  Zealand, can also help streamline cross-  border payments by using a common  language for payments data.   In Canada, the ability to use  rich standardised payments  information will save businesses   time, and our research released   in 2015 on the benefits of ISO 20022  suggests that it could save more than  $4.5bn over five years. Payments Canada  plans to implement ISO 20022 for  its core payment system to improve  interoperability and provide more  services for participants and end users.   Risk management is evolving Risk management processes in retail  systems have evolved to accommodate  interoperable systems, more participants  and faster availability of funds. Risk  management is being addressed  primarily through faster settlement  processes and enhanced collateralisation  use. Large-value systems are seeing more  advanced liquidity-saving tools and real- time monitoring to help mitigate risks.  Payments Canada s Automated Clearing  Settlement System was designated for  oversight by the Bank of Canada in   May, which means it will be subject to  more stringent risk management criteria  going forward.  No  one-size-fits-all  Core payment systems around the world  have significantly evolved since 2005.  Of the 27 countries examined, 24 have  redesigned or added at least one core  payment system. Of these jurisdictions,  20 have made, or are in the process of  making, major changes to more than   one core payment system.   However, there is no one-size-fits- all approach to modernisation. Each  jurisdiction has modernised based on  its own public policy objectives, user  needs and legacy systems. What does  seem clear is that success is enhanced by  taking a holistic, multi-system approach  to modernising core payment systems  that complement each other.   now have at least one ERPS or batch- retail system that provides same-day or  intraday settlement.   To support more timely retail payments,  LVPS hours of operation in some countries  have been extended beyond business  hours. Significant changes to settlement  systems have been made in Australia,  Sweden and the UK to accommodate  faster settlement of retail systems.   Participation A major finding in the research has   been that direct participation in core  systems is widening. Many jurisdictions  have an explicit public policy objective   to increase access for direct participants  in their batch or retail systems and   LVPS. This has resulted in a steady   rise in direct participation, along with   the need to upgrade technology and  improve risk management.   For example, the batch retail system in  New Zealand, with multiple settlements  a day, was established largely to reduce  credit risk to allow international banks  to become direct participants. China  established more than 268 direct  participants in its national automated  clearing house when the China National  Advanced Payments System was  introduced, while managing credit   risk with collateralisation and same-  day settlement.   Other examples include Mexico s  SPEI, which has grown to 98 direct  participants, including non-banks,  ancillary payment systems and a telecom  services provider. The Reserve Bank  Information and Transfer System (RITS)  in Australia has 89 direct participants,  which is up from 67 in 2008.   Enhancing the functionality   of retail systems around the world  was identified as a clear trend in   the Payments Canada and Bank    MANAGEMENT  Carol Ann Northcott  is chief risk officer  and vice president  of risk, security  and research at  Payments Canada    38  The Treasurer October 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  The EU referendum outcome is likely to prompt   treasurers of UK companies to review their working capital  management practices. First and foremost, companies need  to make sure their own processes are as efficient as possible.   Llewelyn Mullooly and Martin Flint explore the issues  In the wake of the Leave vote,  uncertainty abounds. For UK  companies, this uncertainty    has wide-ranging implications     and nowhere is this more evident   than in the area of working   capital management.   Economic uncertainty can affect  working capital management in a  number of ways. For one thing, less  certain market conditions may render  sales forecasts and cash-flow forecasts  inaccurate, leaving companies with a  funding shortfall or with too many assets  on the balance sheet.   Uncertain conditions can also prompt  companies along the supply chain  to adopt greater caution, sometimes  resulting in changes to payment terms  or to the timing of payment to suppliers.  For other companies, particularly  manufacturers, movements in exchange  rates and commodity prices will also  impact working capital, having a   knock-on effect on the cost of raw  materials and inventories.   Impact of the vote Following the financial crisis, many   UK companies focused squarely on  working capital management, and, based  on our analysis undertaken with Markit  Economics, this focus appears to have  remained in place for a number of years.  Positive GDP and more stable economic  and financial conditions in the past   MANAGING   WORKING CAPITAL  UNCERTAIN TIMES  couple of years may, however, have  prompted some companies to shift  some of that focus.  Following the referendum, the  British pound has fallen against   the US dollar by around 12% as    of the beginning of August. For  companies purchasing goods from  overseas suppliers, this type of swing   can have a significant impact on the   cost of raw goods. The Bank of England s  response was to reduce interest rates   by another 25 basis points, while  increasing government and corporate  bond purchases, driving FX rates down  even further.   Equity markets may have rebounded  more recently   but the continuing  uncertainty and mixed economic data  are likely to make working capital  management a challenge for some time  to come. For treasurers, this may be a  good moment to review the company s  working capital management processes.   Best practices Working capital is a resource that  companies need to manage effectively.   Financing working capital comes at   a cost, and in a challenging economic  environment, this can have a direct   impact on the efficiency of assets   and the company s return on capital.   Reducing the amount of working capital  used by the company not only releases  cash into the business for other strategic  objectives, but can also reduce ongoing  financing requirements.   The efficiency of UK companies   working capital practices varies  considerably. Our own research, based   on the publicly available financial data   of around 19,000 companies in the UK,  found that the top 10% of companies in  terms of working capital efficiency had,   on average, twice as much proportional  cash from operations as the bottom 10%.  In an uncertain market, there is a clear  business case for prioritising working  capital management.   Effective working capital management  involves working cross-functionally  within the business and balancing  commercial and financial objectives. For  example, companies have to balance their  need for cash against the importance of  maintaining strong relationships with  their suppliers and customers. They may  also have to consider whether it is better   to prioritise making their own processes  and operations more efficient, or  adopting the financial solutions offered  by banks and others.  Working capital focus While financial solutions can play an  important role in supporting effective  working capital management, the  implementation of those solutions   can be limited by a company s available  management information and existing  business structures and processes   within the organisation.

The objective is to highlight the drivers and  pressures affecting UK working capital cycles,  while supporting UK companies in managing  this critical resource effectively.  The research carried out just before the EU  referendum found that economic uncertainty,  including the UK leaving the EU, was one of   the top five concerns for UK companies when it  comes to working capital management, cited by  19% of respondents. The associated uncertainty  over demand and sales volumes was a concern  for a further 14%.  While it is early days yet, the possible   impact of the Leave vote was illustrated by the  survey, with 20% of respondents saying that  they expected their customers to take longer   to pay them in the coming 12 months.   3.  Robust management information    Simply put, if you can t measure it, you  can t manage it. Banks can play a role  in supporting this exercise. Companies  can work with their banks to analyse  their existing payment and collections  processes, and identify opportunities  for improvement. A good relationship  bank will work with the company to  analyse its data and ask whether those  processes are as efficient as possible.   4.  Financial solutions   Treasurers  should assess the full range of  financial solutions available. In times  of economic uncertainty, treasurers  should take the time to understand  the options available and how they can  be deployed to benefit the company.  Banks will have numerous solutions  available, including supplier financing,  asset invoicing and trade instruments,  as well as cash management solutions  designed to improve companies   payment and collection processes.  Meanwhile, the rise of fintechs has led  to the development of a number of  new technological solutions.  Conclusion While the longer-term impact of the  EU referendum vote remains to be seen,  treasurers should be aware of the likely  effects of the current uncertainty.   In a low-rate environment, companies  may tend to focus less on working capital   because they can manage any shortfalls  through cheap debt. During times of  economic uncertainty, however, there   is a greater need for companies to revisit  their working capital management  strategy. Going into an uncertain  environment, the last thing that any  treasurer wants is to leave untapped   cash in the business. They will therefore  be taking the opportunity to make sure  that working capital is a priority across  the business.   impact margins, increase risk within  the supply chain or damage commercial  relationships or reputations over the   long term.  The cross-functional engagement and  requirement to balance often competing  priorities requires treasurers to think  carefully about how effectively working  capital is being managed within their  organisations. The following are a few key  points to consider in light of the current  economic environment: 1. Proper focus   To be effective,   companies need to ensure that working  capital is a boardroom discussion and  seen as a finance and business priority  throughout the organisation. It should  be incorporated into planning cycles,  agendas, targets, KPIs, investment  cases and scorecards   and should also  be measured, with metrics managed  and shared across the different  functions in the organisation.  2.  Governance frameworks    Clearly defined areas of  accountability are needed for  influencing and working across  functions, as well as regular  forums for review and challenge.  Only then can companies achieve  sustainable improvements.

What actions  should I take in the immediate  term to protect my financials  from further volatility?”   We experienced similar  frantic reactions from the  global treasury community  the morning after the Swiss  National Bank broke the peg to  euro, or when negative interest  rates became a new normal in  the eurozone. These concerns  are also further elevated for  companies that are undergoing  organisational or structural  shifts, such as an initial public  offering (IPO) or M&A.  Across currencies in the  Americas, Asia and Europe,  the past year and a half has  seen more extreme movements  beyond two standard  deviations   movements  that are greater than 95% of  statistically expected outcomes.

ANH NGUYEN EXPLAINS  unprecedented  volatility. From  our experience  of working with  more than 300  corporates globally,  a solid foundation   of objectives and constraints is  the most important compass  to navigate uncharted waters  and devise risk management  decisions. A holistic assessment  across all aspects of risk is then  required if corporates are to  select optimal strategies. Those  will then need periodic reviews  and updates, particularly in  changing environments.  Put objectives first Risk management objectives  need to be specific, well defined  and understood across all   levels of the organisation.   For the majority of companies,  having a hedging strategy in  place allows them to buy time  to react to sudden shifts in  the market with appropriate  business decisions and smooth  FX impact on the financials.   In an ideal world, if a company  had perfect ability to change   its business operations, such   as immediately raising sales  prices or changing suppliers   in response to adverse currency  impacts, the company would  not need to hedge. In reality,  depending on the industry  and competitive dynamics,  few companies are able to pass  currency risk up or down the   value chain immediately. The  timing cushion, within which  the company can be insulated  from these shocks, determines  the length of the company s   risk management horizon   and expectations.  Risk management objectives  can change over time as  the company experiences  organisational shift throughout  its life cycle. Impacts on FX  risk management approaches  due to structural changes  in the organisation can be  overshadowed by impacts   of overnight shifts in external  market conditions. While  market shocks tend to trigger  scrutiny of the company s  hedging strategy by the board  and investors, more attention  should also be paid to how  risk management objectives  and constraints may change  following shifts in corporate  structure, such as an IPO or   a strategic acquisition.   Such events require the  company to reassess its risk  tolerance and the sensitivity of  its stakeholders. For example,   a private company under a  single investor s ownership   may have a more discretionary  view of specific exposures.  Once the company is listed,   risk management objectives  might gravitate towards a  removal of financial volatility,  given the large base of investors  with varying priorities.  Similarly, separate entities   are likely to have different  perception and objectives of  risk management that need   to be discussed and reconciled  upon a merger or acquisition.   Capital structuring   and hedging  Strategic capital structure  selection can be an effective  way to introduce natural  offsets to the company s  overall risk profile. When used  appropriately in conjunction  with operational hedging  programmes, this approach  can provide companies with a  more dynamic risk strategy that  addresses different objectives  and constraints.  An issuance in foreign  debt markets (or a synthetic  foreign debt via the use of  cross-currency swaps) can  create a natural hedge: foreign  interest payable offsets positive  cash flow in that currency  on the profit and loss, while  the liability itself can be a  natural hedge of foreign equity.  Operational hedging, on the  other hand, is the ongoing  hedging of foreign flows  generated by the business,   to remove volatility in specific  financial metrics (for example,  EBITDA, net income or  covenants). Given the multiple  impacts of a single strategy  on a company s results, it is  crucial that every risk strategy  is assessed against specific  and well-defined objectives.   42  The Treasurer October 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer    exposure to stabilise financial  results. A large negative mark- to-market can be emotionally  unnerving; in the wake of  the EU referendum, we had  conversations with companies  that considered unwinding  their forward contracts to  capitalise on the gains, or settle  the losses and put on new  trades at market levels. These  may be discretionary tactics  for cash flows and budgeting  reasons specific to each  company, but might not be  straightforward to implement  for complex tax and accounting  reasons. Moreover, since  hedges were put in place to  protect certain forecasts against  market volatility, there is a  strong case for not removing  this protection at the most  volatile time, unless the nature  of the underlying exposures has  changed significantly due to  this market shock (for example,  a re-forecasting is required). In  this example, long-term risk  management priorities can be  overshadowed by foggy market  environments, and companies  that rely solely on tactical  actions may risk no longer  having a strategic direction.   In light of recent market  shocks, risk management  policies should be reviewed  to validate whether they are  still appropriate and meet set  objectives. It should be assessed  at what cost these objectives are  achieved and whether there are   hedging results when  capital structuring and  operational hedging  decisions lie within  separate teams, or  when there is no holistic  assessment of risk profiles   across these separate functions.  For example, a company  may over-hedge its euro net  cash flows when hedging  forecasted euro EBITDA  without taking into account  the impact of interest expenses  from an existing EUR/GBP  cross-currency swap that  synthetically converts sterling  debt to euro liability.  Policy requires regular  review and maintenance A hedging policy that  efficiently addresses the  company s objectives, priorities  and constraints can be   more resilient in the face   of changing environments.  When confronted with a  sudden market shock, the  company s approach to natural  hedging strategies is less likely  to change significantly.   In the shorter term,  an operational hedging  programme helps insulate the  company from this overnight  shock, as FX rates are already  locked in for the chosen  hedging horizon. That said,  this benefit is achieved via a  sizeable mark-to-market figure,  an asset/liability that offsets the  FX loss/gain of the underlying   For example, a publicly  listed company primarily  focusing on earnings  per share may only reap  marginal benefits from  foreign debt (via its interest  expense netting positive  flows in the same currency),  whereas a company that cares  more deeply about its equity  value (for example, to protect  investors  equity returns) may  consider capital structuring the  most efficient tool.   While capital structuring is  most appropriate as a longer- term risk-mitigation strategy  (for example, three to five  years), given the relatively rigid  structure of debt, operational  hedging can be more dynamic  and adaptable to a changing  profile of exposures over  time. This flexible structure  also means that operational  programmes are designed   to smooth FX impacts over a  shorter horizon (for example,  a fiscal year), rather than  removing risk altogether.  The two approaches, with  their respective pros and cons,  offer limitless alternatives for  designing an optimal policy.  They cannot be designed in  isolation and need to work   in tandem to achieve the   level of risk reduction and  horizon of risk management  defined by the company s  objectives. We have seen  companies experiencing  inefficiencies and unexpected   new objectives and constraints  that need to be addressed.  With changes in corporate  ownership, capital or  organisational structure,  the company s risk policy  should adapt to shifting risk  management objectives. Whereas  FX used to be a more reactive  topic in the larger context of  change management in corporate  finance and treasury, we have  increasingly seen companies  taking a more proactive approach  to FX discussions at the board  and senior management level at  the early stage of an IPO, M&A  or divestiture in anticipation of  shifts in priorities or potential  disconnect in objectives   and constraints.  In the face of changing  environments, we have seen  that the three crucial pillars   for a resilient risk management  strategy are a solid foundation  of objectives and constraints, a  holistic assessment of potential  strategies with both capital  structuring and operational  hedging approaches, and a  discipline of periodic policy  reviews and updates.    www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer October 2016 The Treasurer  43  Anh Nguyen is   manager in risk  management advisory  at Chatham Financial     More than 10,500  treasury professionals  around the world  are looking at this page  Advertise today: CONTACT Tom Fountain  Group Advertising Manager   tel: +44 (0)20 3771 7250   or email:   tom.fountain@thinkpublishing.co.uk  Dan Gallagher  Senior Advertising Executive  tel: +44 (0)20 3771 7244   or email:  dan.gallagher@thinkpublishing.co.uk  Online at:  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  www.treasurers.org/treasuryjobs  The M agazine of The Association of Corporate Treasurers  w w  w .treasurers.org/thetreasurer  The Treasurer O  cto b  er 20 16  THE MAGAZINE OF  THE ASSOCIATION O  F CORPORATE TREA SURERS   OCTOBER 2016  DEALS OF THE YEAR  2016  How to enter this yea r s awards and   secure your place in  the limelight  14-PAGE   SPECIAL   Cash & liquidity management Europe s conversion c  ycle,   payment and settleme nt   trends, and cash mou ntains  www.treasurers.org/ thetreasurer  SKILLS RECOGNISED Microsoft s Rahul Da  swani on   structured finance an d the need    for good communicat ion  LOCATION LOCATION The case for having t  reasury  operations in Hong K ong  THE GLOBAL TAX PRO JECT  International measu res that aim    to level the playing fi eld  PLUS  01 Cover Oct16_v2_gre ybackgroundB.indd   1  23/09/2016   10:46  10  issues a year    in print    regulation and supervision of  insurance companies, while  rating agencies consider various  criteria in order to provide  opinions on the financial  strength of insurers in respect  of their ability to pay claims   to policyholders.   Regulatory capital coverage  ratios and rating agency  opinions are helpful to pension  schemes in assessing the   short-term financial strength   of prospective buy-in and  buyout providers, but what  criteria might those schemes  and their advisers use to form  their own view?  Capital requirements Insurers hold capital to ensure  they can pay policyholders.  Under the current regulatory  capital regime (known as   Solvency II ), insurers are  required to hold capital that   In selecting an insurer,  price is an important  factor for pension   schemes, but it should not   be the only factor. Unlike the  short-term insurance business,  where the consequences of  under-pricing quickly manifest  themselves, the repercussions  for the pension buy-in and  buyout business may not be  realised for many years. This  poses a challenge for pension  schemes that are entrusting an  insurer to meet the obligation  to pay scheme members for   the next 50 or more years.  One of the main benefits  of buy-ins and buyouts is  that the security of members   benefits naturally increases as  they move out of the pension s  framework into regulated  insurance. However, not all  insurance companies have the  same financial strength, and  this should not be overlooked  when selecting an insurer.  In the US, the 1991 insolvency  of Executive Life, a California- based annuity writer, offers an  interesting case study, which  ultimately led to a system  under which pension plans  cannot select insurers that have  not first met independently  assessed  safest available  provider  criteria, irrespective   of the price they can offer.  In the UK, a prudent  regulatory framework exists  to ensure that insurance  companies remain strong, but  no such specific requirement  exists for buyout providers to be  independently assessed against  set criteria. To a large extent,  pension schemes implicitly  rely on rating agencies,  the Prudential Regulatory  Authority (PRA) and any  covenant advice that they  take to assess and ensure the  financial strength of insurers.  The PRA is responsible for the   Financial risk management Governance issues  of the insurer s balance sheet,  are also important indicators.  Balance-sheet quality,  size and diversification Insurers back the pension  promises they take on with  a variety of investments and  must strike a balance between  investing with caution and  sourcing assets that generate  yields sufficient to support  competitive pricing. A large,  established insurer with a  high-quality, well-diversified  investment portfolio may in  some instances charge a higher  premium than those insurers  that operate less diversified  investment portfolios.   Monoline insurers that  focus on a specific product are  exposed to a much narrower  range of risks than multiline  insurers. Pension schemes,  therefore, need to decide  whether a higher premium  represents good value for the  additional security offered.  Long-term value While price will always be  an important consideration,  trustees and sponsoring  companies should also  pay close attention to the  value of the policy they  are buying. The long-term  security of the insurer    demonstrated by a large and  well-diversified balance sheet    is an important, and often  overlooked, point in that   value consideration.

Relationships   and correlations between  currencies, which for a long  time appeared reliable, have  recently shown a tendency to  break down. These breakdowns  usually occur at a time of  general economic stress, and  the fallout is often dramatic.   Recently, the most extreme  example is the EUR/CHF  currency pair. It was floored   at 1.2000 by the Swiss National  Bank (SNB) on 6 September  2011 and the floor was defended  by the SNB selling CHF and  buying EUR (see Figure 1).  However, the SNB did not   sterilise  its intervention in  the markets   ie, it did not sell  government bonds to soak up  the extra supply of CHF.   Although this policy could  have gone on ad infinitum from  a pure currency perspective  (since a central bank can  always turn to the printing  presses and never run out of  its own currency to sell), from  a money-supply perspective,  there were always going  to be limits to the policy s  duration. This is because every  unsterilised Swiss franc that  was printed added to the Swiss  money supply. One of the main  reasons for the intervention  in the first place was to avoid  deflation. However, a spiralling  money supply eventually  unnerved the SNB, and on   15 January 2015, it abandoned  the EUR/CHF floor. This saw  the exchange rate plummet   by some 30% on the day,   and anyone who was relying    ONCE RELIABLE, CURRENCY PAIRS MAY NOT BE A SAFE BET IN THE FUTURE,   AND TREASURERS SHOULD CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY VOLATILITY   ON SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS, JAMES STRETTON ARGUES   on the continuation of the  1.2000 floor was suddenly  completely wrong-footed.  Another currency pair, the  ongoing stability of which it  would be imprudent to rely  on, is EUR/PLN. Indeed, this  may be an accident waiting to  happen. Figure 2 shows the  history of this currency pair  since the euro s inception on   1 January 1999.   The past five years have seen  the rate range bound between  broadly 4.0000 and 4.5000.  Encouraged by Poland s  enthusiastic membership of  the EU, and the recent relative  stability of the exchange rate,  some have been prompted to  regard the PLN as a proxy for  the euro. This could be a very  dangerous notion.   Were one or more eurozone  members to leave, it is not clear  whether the euro would be  stronger or weaker   it would   depend on who left. A euro  without Germany would leave  the single currency as weak as  a kitten. Certainly, EUR/PLN  would be highly unlikely to  remain in the 4.0000 to   4.5000 range.   It is not just reliance on  correlations that can wreak  havoc in corporate treasuries.  Many businesses also have  loose or formal arrangements  with their suppliers or  customers to share in the pain  or gain from substantial FX  movements. Yet, even formal  agreements can be subject   to hasty renegotiation in  difficult times, and loose  agreements have a habit of  disappearing completely.  For example, in the  aftermath of the financial  crisis, suppliers of imported  food products, who had  looked for support from  their supermarket customers   during previous bouts of  sterling weakness, found it  very difficult to push through  price rises. They face the same  problem once again, in that  the fall in GBP/EUR since  the referendum has occurred  against the backdrop of a  sharp fall in general business  confidence. This, combined  with fierce supermarket price  wars, means the supermarket  buyers are in no mood to help  out suppliers by paying more  for imported products.   Currency risk This is the iron law of FX: large  currency movements always  happen for a reason. In many  cases, the underlying cause  of the movement will make  it even more difficult to cope  with, whether it s a financial  crisis or an unanticipated  political event.  Some companies, perhaps  due to a lack of experience,  could make the mistake of  assuming that since they pay  for certain imported inputs in  sterling, they are not exposed  to currency risk. While this  may be convenient in times   of stable exchange rates, in the  event of a decent downward  move of the pound, suppliers  will quickly raise their sterling  prices in order to maintain  their prices in terms of their  own reporting currency. The  pricing of some manufacturing  inputs may be even more  nuanced. For instance, a  manufacturer using oil-based  products from the eurozone  is likely to be exposed to the  dollar, rather than the euro,  since oil is priced in dollars.   As if all of this were not  tricky enough, companies  have to contend with the  competition. Even if a firm  manages to avoid being  lulled into a false sense of  security offered by a particular  consensus view and seeks   to hedge itself in order to  protect against adverse  currency movements, it   must still consider the actions  of its competitors.   46  The Treasurer October 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  IK O  N  IM  A G  ES    Importers trading in  products that have few  substitutes might be assumed  to be in the same boat. In   the case of sterling weakness,  eventually they will all have   to raise prices. Although,   those who have hedged will   be able to hold out for longer  and potentially increase market  share. However, in the case   of sterling strength, the   Alternatively, an exporter  of goods or services may be  competing with domestic  manufacturers in the export  market, who face little or no  FX risk. In this circumstance,  sterling strength, if unhedged,  could prove disastrous, since,  depending on the price  elasticity of demand for the  export, there may be little  ability to pass on currency- induced price increases.  As we have seen from EUR/ CHF and longer-term historical  movements in EUR/PLN,  seemingly stable currency pairs  have the potential to surprise.  And, it can be perilous to rely  on the consensus, as the recent  EU referendum demonstrated.   Attempts to share the pain  or gain of currency movements  with customers or suppliers   are often successful when   the movements are relatively  small and when times are good.  However, when movements  are large, they are often  accompanied by some general  economic malaise for at least  one of the parties.   Some companies may be  able to reprice when input   costs rise or their reporting  currency appreciates. Though  the ability to do this will  depend very much on the  market for the product or  service, and on competition.   For those operating in  competitive markets, neither  currency stability nor  relationships with customers  or suppliers should be  taken for granted. In these  circumstances, the sensible  use of derivatives to create  a flexible hedging strategy  becomes crucial.

Second, Asian corporate  groups are expanding globally  with acquisitions and also  maturing in their operations,  including their treasury  functions. There is a growing  recognition and awareness  among Asian corporate groups,  as they become more global,  of the need to centralise  the treasury function and  the management of cash, to  better manage liquidity and  reduce funding costs across  the corporate group. As these  Asian corporate groups obtain  better visibility over their  cash and debt positions, such  considerations invariably turn  to the centralisation of the  corporate treasury function  into a CTC.   According to a recent EY  survey of corporate treasurers  on global and regional  operating models and  location selection for CTCs in  Asia-Pacific, key factors that  corporate groups look into  on CTC location selection  typically include: • sophistication of    financial infrastructure;  • access to capital markets;  • cost and availability of   treasury talent;  • overall tax environment; • legal and regulatory   environment; and • political stability.   For CTCs actively managing  the treasury position (as  distinct from service-centre- type CTCs performing, for  example, payment processing),  aspects such as the legal and  regulatory environment,  access to capital markets and   Hong Kong has  introduced recent law  changes to address the   asymmetrical tax treatment   of interest income and expense  that previously had made it  less favourable for regional  corporate treasury centres  (CTCs). It has also added a  half-rate tax incentive with a  view to attracting more global  and regional CTCs.   Hong Kong is well  positioned for corporate groups  (both Western multinational  corporations (MNCs) and  Asian outbounds) to centralise  their global and regional  treasury functions because  of its proximity to mainland  China, the largest offshore  renminbi pool, well-developed  banking system, efficient  capital and FX markets, deep  talent pool of experienced  treasury, banking and asset  management personnel,  favourable regulatory and   tax regime, and sound  common law legal system.   The recent tax law changes  will make Hong Kong more  competitive when global and  Asian MNCs look for a location  to set up a corporate treasury  centre in the Asian time zone,”  says Vincent Lee, executive  director of the Hong Kong  Monetary Authority.  There are two key drivers  behind the interest in Asia as  a base for CTCs. First, the size  and scale of Western MNCs  in the region have continued  to increase as the balance of  economic power shifts towards  Asia and other emerging  markets.  The increased scale  of Western MNCs in Asia is  resulting in an increased need  for the active management  of treasury during the Asian  time zone and to be closer to  the markets to better deal with  some of the regulatory and   Hong Kong is one of the most competitive  economies worldwide, according to    the IMD Competitiveness Center  availability of treasury talent  are generally assumed to be  a given for a location to be  seriously considered for setting  up a CTC.   Why Hong Kong? Without doubt, Hong Kong  has its strengths. It ranks as  the world s most competitive  economy in the IMD World  Competitiveness Yearbook 2016,  moving up from second place  in 2015. It also places third  globally behind Switzerland  and Luxembourg and first in  Asia in terms of availability of  financial services in the World  Economic Forum s Global  Competitive Report 2015-2016.  Hong Kong has high standards  of market transparency,  disclosure, prudent supervision  and is without exchange  controls, all crucial for  centralised treasury functions.1    While we are seeing a lot  of interest in Shanghai for  treasury centres focused on  managing the treasury position  in China, and an onshore  cash pool for renminbi, for a  regional or global CTC in Asia,  the choice invariably comes  down to Singapore and Hong  Kong,” according to E-May  Neoh, Asia head of liquidity  management, Bank of America  Merrill Lynch.  The location of  choice is then decided around  a corporate group s current  geographic footprint and  regional headquarters location,  together with economic  factors, such as taxation.”  Hong Kong is one of the  most competitive economies  worldwide, according to the  IMD World Competitiveness  Center, and is already a leading  destination for regional and  international headquarters  and CTCs. Based on the  Report on 2015 Annual Survey  of Companies in Hong  Kong Representing Parent  Companies Located outside  Hong Kong, the number of  regional headquarters, regional  offices and local offices in  Hong Kong rose from 6,948     www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer October 2016 The Treasurer  49  SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K    50  The Treasurer October 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  James Badenach is a  partner and international  tax services leader    financial services at   EY Hong Kong  The views reflected in this article are the  views of the author and do not necessarily  reflect the views of the global EY  organisation or its member firms.   1 Asia Treasury Trailblazer Summit   2015, Hong Kong Monetary Authority,   30 April 2015 (www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/ key-information/speech-speakers/ pstpang/20150430-1.shtml) 2 Published by the Census and Statistics  Department Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region (www.statistics.gov. hk/pub/B11100042015AN15B0100.pdf) 3 Hong Kong: The Facts (www.gov.hk/en/ about/abouthk/factsheets/docs/ financial_services.pdf)  in 2011 to 7,904 in 2015.2 Of  these, there is a steady growing  rate of set-ups with parent  companies located in China.   Hong Kong made its  intention clear in the 2014  budget of attracting more  CTCs to Hong Kong to enhance  its position as a leading  global international financial  centre, a leading offshore  renminbi centre, a premier  asset management hub and an  international capital market.  The Hong Kong government  followed through with the  passing of legislation that  addressed the tax asymmetry  issue in the Hong Kong  domestic tax law and also  legislated a tax rate incentive  of 8.25%.   The asymmetry issue  previously arose where interest  expenses paid to overseas  non-financial institutions  prior to the law changes were  not tax-deductible in Hong  Kong for a CTC carrying on  the business of lending of  money in Hong Kong, while  at the same time the interest  income from overseas lending  was chargeable to tax in Hong  Kong.  The law has now been  changed to address this issue,  albeit with certain conditions,”  says Alice Chan, partner and  international tax services  leader at EY Hong Kong.  Our  clients are now viewing Hong  Kong in a different light in any  analysis on location selection  for their regional or global  CTCs. Now Hong Kong is  being seriously considered,  which bodes well for Hong  Kong, given its geographic  advantage of being proximate  to mainland China.”   In addition, Hong Kong  has legislated for a tax rate  incentive of 50% of the current  profits tax rate (ie 8.25%) for  qualifying CTCs in respect of  a broad range of prescribed  corporate treasury services  and transactions. The tax rate  incentive is relatively wide in  terms of the activities that fall  within the incentive, however,   to obtain the incentive may  require CTCs to set up in a  separate legal entity to conduct  the treasury activities.   For regional or global CTCs  in Asia-Pacific, Hong Kong  and Singapore are generally  the preferred locations, and  there has been a healthy  rivalry between them as  global financial centres, with  both possessing the relevant  attributes for corporate  treasurers. Both locations  are well positioned as CTC  hubs in terms of financial  infrastructure, efficient FX  market, availability of treasury  talents, and sound regulatory  and legal framework. Hong  Kong has a comparative  advantage in its role as a  premier offshore renminbi  centre and, having close ties  with China, better established  equity capital market as well  as a more extensive network  of international corporate and  investment banks.   Under the three-tier banking  system, Hong Kong has a  highly developed banking  market, with approximately  70% of the top 100 banks in  the world having operations in  Hong Kong. Being one of the  most active markets for initial   public offerings, Hong Kong s  stock market was the fifth- largest in the world and the  third-largest in Asia in terms of  market capitalisation as at the  end of April 2015. In addition,  Hong Kong s debt market is  one of the most liquid markets  in Asia. By the end of April  2015, the outstanding amount  of the Exchange Fund Bills and  Notes was about HK$752.8bn,  with a daily turnover averaged  at HK$12.6bn.3  Tax treaties In contrast, Singapore is  often perceived as better in  terms of geographic proximity  to ASEAN countries, the  availability and quality of  treasury talent, a long-standing  specific tax incentive for  treasury centres (among other  favourable tax incentives,  including those in the financial  services space) and a well- developed commodities  market. Singapore also has a  larger tax treaty network than  Hong Kong in terms of the  number of treaties. However, as  a result of Hong Kong s active  effort to expand its tax treaty  network, Hong Kong now   has a number of tax treaties  offering a more favourable  interest withholding tax rate  than Singapore. Specifically  on the CTC regimes in both  locations, the new CTC  incentive enacted by Hong  Kong does leave little arbitrage  between the two locations  from a tax rate perspective.  Nevertheless, tax should  never be the sole consideration  in choosing the location of  a CTC. The location should   depend on the footprint and  business needs of the corporate  group and the physical location  of the corporate treasury  team actively managing the  corporate group s treasury, and  related treasury and financial  risks. Going forward, as a direct  result of changes happening  globally to the international  tax system through the  Organisation for Economic   Co-operation and  Development s Base Erosion  and Profit Shifting project,   aligning the location of the  treasury team and the location  where transactions are booked  will be crucial for any MNC  looking to access reduced rates  of interest withholding tax  under tax treaties, for example,  and to manage its transfer  pricing risk”, says Eng Ping   Yeo, EY ASEAN tax leader.  For corporate groups that  focus solely on the ASEAN  region, Singapore may offer   a slight competitive advantage  given its geographic proximity;  for those corporate groups  that have material business  activities with or in mainland  China and the rest of  northeastern Asia, Hong Kong  has a distinctive geographic  advantage over Singapore. For  mainland Chinese enterprises,  Hong Kong is unquestionably  the natural outbound gate.

MARTIN BELLIN PROPOSES A NEW MODEL  Treasury operations Technology  only large multinationals, but  increasingly also for smaller  companies. Nearly everyone   is active on a global level these  days, and treasurers the world  over are forced to stay abreast  of any economic and political  developments. They need to  think ahead, but at the same  time be able to act on the spot  if need be. They re the ones  managing liquidity; they re   the ones hedging risk; and,   as such, they re key players  in any business. It should  therefore be any company s  top priority to make sure  treasurers have what they need  to meet the challenges of their  profession and the increased  demands globalisation has  placed on them.  and automating processes;  reducing and doing away with  manual processes; and boosting  efficiency. Treasurers want to  be freed of repetitive, tedious  manual jobs, such as gathering  data from subsidiaries. They  want to focus on decisions that  bring real value to the company  and their implementation.   Digitisation has made things  faster, and the world feels  smaller as a result. A seemingly  inconsequential event anywhere  in the world can have huge  repercussions for businesses     and this is no longer true for   No one-size-fits-all way   to strategic treasury So how can we best support  treasurers in their work? It is  important to remember that  every business is different  and that there may be more  than one way of achieving this  ultimate objective of treasury:  underpinning a company s  every financial move and  ensuring a sound strategy   that safeguards liquidity  and boosts profitability    weathering any political or  economic turbulences.   Software as a service (SaaS)  has made the lives of treasurers  much easier: cloud-based  systems have allowed them  access to group-wide data at the  touch of a button, in real time,  regardless of their location.  This has brought a considerable  reduction of treasurers   workloads. Nevertheless, there  is a powerful trend towards   Treasury management  without the use of  professional tools to   underpin treasury processes  seems more and more  unthinkable in a modern,  technology-driven world.

Let s build on the  achievements SaaS technology  has brought us and take the  next step. Let s embrace the  service component of treasury,  and listen to what corporate  treasurers really need.   by someone else who is  familiar with the system and  understands treasury processes.  While using a TMS does  make life that much easier, it   is still an application treasurers  need to spend time on. It  requires implementation,  training and maintenance.  For some treasurers, it  might indeed be time to ask  themselves: am I really running  my treasury, or am I running  my treasury system? Am   I putting the data in my TMS to  optimum use? What if I could  boil things down to the point  where I am left with strategic  decision-making as my only  real  task ?   We ve already mentioned the  important role of treasurers for  sensitive and crucial financial  issues: where is excess liquidity  tied up that could be used  elsewhere? Which investments  are needed and who needs an  intercompany loan? Which  risks need to be hedged? Or,  to put it in even more practical  terms, how do I ensure my  company is unaffected by any  potential repercussions that  Brexit might bring? Treasurers  need to be enabled to stay   on top of these decisions, to  have complete visibility and  to use their overview to their  strategic advantage.  It s the results that count Treasurers need data and  results. They may also want  the application, but they may  also not. Let s put this in non- treasury terms: who today is  still willing to pay for an app  on their smartphone? Hardly  anyone. It is more or less  taken for granted that apps   are provided for free. Now,  the actual data, the results,  are a very different matter.  Yes, we might be willing to  pay someone for providing  us with the information we  need to take further action.  If someone presents me with  the complete results, all neatly  prepared and geared towards  my requirements, and all I need  to do is say yes or no   that  represents a service that really  makes my life easier and that  has real value for me.  The specific treasury  services a company might  require depend very much on  size and strategy. There are a  number of non-mission critical  and non-core competence  processes in treasury. In theory,  TaaS can cover any corporate  treasury operation and can be  made to fit any functionality  required. It is all a question of  capacity, focus and, ultimately,  preference. As a company, you  might have certain tedious,  recurring treasury processes  that you simply don t want your  treasury staff spending their  time on and allocating their  resources to. Or you might have  more complex requirements  that would mean having to   buy in outside expertise. Or you  may not even have a treasury in  the first place.   TaaS can support any role   in a corporate s front, middle or  back office, including operative  maintenance of master data;  regular system-data verification  and maintenance; account  statement collection and  verification; daily financial  status reporting; automation  control and error resolution;  monitoring liquidity   even more automation, and  even more focus on the way  a corporate treasury adds  strategic value to a business.  Even with considerable  automation by means of a  treasury management system  (TMS), companies might still  be left with daily tasks that  exceed their capacities. Or  they may simply choose to  focus their energies even more  on what they can do with the  results a treasury application  provides. Whether you have a  treasury set up, but would like  to spend your time differently;  or whether you don t have a  treasury, but would still like to  benefit from the added value  treasury data and management  can bring, the key to both can  be outsourcing   via Treasury  as a Service (TaaS). Echoing  SaaS, TaaS goes beyond mere  technical support. It aims  to meet the very objective  of modern treasury even  more pointedly: eliminating  inefficient and repetitive tasks  that can easily be performed      54  The Treasurer October 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  exhibited by underperforming  teams. These characteristics are  linked and build from one to  another, leading ultimately to  the potential of team failure.  So, what makes a team   go wrong?  Characteristic 1:   Absence of trust Typically, teams that have low  trust levels come about as a  result of team members not  being prepared to be vulnerable  with one another. This will  often manifest itself in people  hiding mistakes, not admitting  their weaknesses and generally  not asking for help.  Characteristic 2:   Fear of conflict When team members do not  trust each other, this can often  lead to members staying quiet  when they disagree, or withhold  ideas and contributions that  otherwise could benefit creative  behaviour. The reason for  staying quiet is that it is easier  than starting conflicts with  colleagues. Often, cliques will  form and conversations are had   Behavioural skills Working effectively with others  Those that can, share EFFECTIVE, FOCUSED TEAMS HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND A WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE WITH EACH  OTHER AT THEIR CORE. VANESSA HARWOOD-WHITCHER EXPLAINS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF   HIGH-PERFORMANCE TEAMS AND SHOWS HOW TO SPOT THE SIGNS OF LESS-EFFECTIVE ONES   Take a small, eclectic group of friends, mix together with some great  minds, a garage and a big  ambition to change the nature  of computing and what do you  get? The answer, of course, was  the birth of the Apple Mac, the  fastest-selling machine that  beat any PC created before it.  The story of the now  infamous Steve Jobs and Steve  Wozniak is widely known,  and while one may not think  that the most people-friendly  leadership skills could be  found at Apple, the story   is worth examining in more  detail when it comes to its  team approach.  The brilliant minds that  formed the Mac team were  incredibly competitive within  Apple and externally, with their  ambition to beat the other PCs  on the market at the time. The  team and its leader, Steve Jobs,  were single-minded in their focus  to create an affordable PC that  could be used by non-techies.  This relentless focus on  creating the Mac often led to  the most stretching goals and  deadlines being set, and stories  prevail of the caffeine-fuelled,  break-free days and nights  spent building the prototype.  Of course, this often led to  those creative minds having  bust-ups and fallouts, some   of which were told to dramatic  effect in the film Steve Jobs.  Spotting a high- performing team Thinking about one s own  experience of leading or  working within a team, it is  worth taking a few moments  to consider what made that  team a success or failure. There  are often signs that a manager  can spot to help them gauge  the health of the team they  are working in. The diagram  below gives some checkpoints  for leaders to use to see where  their team is strong, and areas  on which they can help their  team to develop.  SIGNS OF A HEALTHY TEAM  Looking back at the Apple  example of a team, a few clues  start to unravel why a seemingly  unorthodox group of people  had such success, including:  focus, clarity, productivity,  stretch and feedback.  What makes a team   go wrong? Of course, the Apple team  wasn t perfect, as the film  depicts. Spotting the signs of   an underperforming team can  be really helpful to managers.   Author Patrick Lencioni  wrote a book called The Five  Dysfunctions of a Team.  The first half of the book  introduces the reader to a  fictitious management team  and the journey of its members  together, and the second half  discusses the key reasons for  team failure. It is an excellent  read and recommended for  anyone working within or  leading a team.   Lencioni explains that there  are a number of dysfunctions   WHAT MAKES A   TEAM GO WRONG?

Their  organisations are usually a  source of standards, which  many will recognise in   the shape of values/goals,  KPIs and defined internal  behaviours. Other places   to look for standards are  through competitors or  industry benchmarks.  The ACT has developed its  own benchmark competency  framework, which defines  the skills and competencies a  treasurer needs no matter what  stage of their career. Developed  after extensive consultation  within the profession, it sets  the standards for not only  the technical treasury skills  needed, but also the business  and behavioural skills, too.  In order to be a rounded  leader within treasury, the  ACT suggests that treasurers  must be slick operators when  it comes to influencing and  working with others effectively.  These skills, of course, are  critical when applied to the  need for leaders to drive the  performance of their teams  and overcome the barriers  highlighted above.  To this end, learners on the  ACT s Diploma in Treasury  Management qualification,  which leads to AMCT member  status, are now required to   and leaders need to be aware  of the impact they themselves  have on creating the right  environment for all team  members to: • deal with trust issues; • value conflict; • encourage commitment; • promote accountability; and •   celebrate results when the   team achieves something.  Setting standards   and benchmarking  By setting standards, a  leader can perform their  role in overcoming barriers  to high performance. Clear  performance standards start  to tackle issues around trust,  communication, commitment  and results. Standards are  important because: • they give clarity of purpose; •  they shape the way things   need to be done culturally; • leaders can be explicit    about the performance  expected, leading to  improved productivity;  • leaders can reward excellent  performance, as once the  standard is reached, a result  can be recognised; and  • leaders can identify  development needs helping  self-awareness, confidence  and stretch.  The ACT suggests that treasurers  must be slick operators  R EX   F EA  TU R  ES  The Apple team in   the film Steve Jobs  complete a new unit called  The Treasury Manager. This  unit explores the leadership  skills required from treasurers,  covering topics such as leading  a team, encouraging teamwork  and collaboration, influencing,  negotiation and conflict  management skills. In short,  all the soft skills needed to help  drive a high-performing team.  The ACT also has an online  diagnostic tool, which helps  leaders to identify the strengths  and development areas of their  team, the Capability Analysis  Tool. This checks more than 80  competencies from the ACT s  competency framework and   can offer managers a real insight  into both themselves and their  team s effectiveness.

With Apple s charismatic  leader and team focus, business  performance naturally followed.  In Steve Jobs  own words:  Great  things in business are never done  by one person; they re done by a  team of people.”   behind closed doors rather  than airing issues as a group.  Characteristic 3:   Lack of commitment When there is no conflict,   it is difficult to get issues and  ideas out in the open and  debate them properly. This  means when an idea does gain  traction among some team  members, if it has not been  debated and buy-in gained,  the team will ultimately not  commit to the decision or  action. This can have a knock- on effect of not having clear  and agreed goals, which can  lead to ambiguity and lack   of focus.  Characteristic 4:   Avoidance of accountability When teams are not  committed to the objective  or goal, it is unlikely that the  individuals within them will  take full accountability for the  team s actions. Even the most  dedicated employee would find  it difficult to hold others to  account if they do not believe  in the cause.  Characteristic 5:   Inattention to results If people aren t committed  or held to account, personal  agendas can start to distract   the team and members  eyes  are taken off the ball. This   can lead to goals being missed   and results not achieved,  which, in turn, can affect  commitment and motivation.

DOUG WILLIAMSON SHARES A SIMPLE TOOL TO SORT OUT THE NUMBERS  SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K  POWERS OF CONCENTRATION   As corporate treasurers, we can often improve interest income by switching temporary cash surpluses between  different currencies, using an FX swap.  This is an example of cash concentration.  Given the obvious benefits, why don t  treasurers do that all the time?  FX differences An FX swap will produce FX differences,  and potentially FX losses. These FX losses  can wipe out any interest benefits.  Weighing up the costs and benefits can  be tricky, but a simple  With vs Without   technique will keep our thinking clear.  We ll apply this technique to a practical  case, derived from a recent exam question.  Dollar attractions TSA, based in Paris, has a temporary cash  surplus of EUR 8 million for 180 days. TSA  has a US subsidiary, which has a surplus  of USD 5 million, also for 180 days. Rates  available locally to TSA and to its US  subsidiary are set out below.  180-day deposits, per annum: EUR: 0.05% USD 5 million: 0.224%   It s useful to understand this trade-off,   but we don t necessarily need to calculate  the offsetting items separately.   Keep it simple A simpler plan is to compare the net cash   at maturity under each alternative.   This will show the net benefit, or   the net loss, from undertaking the   deal. We ll calculate the terminal cash   in euros: • With concentration in dollars using   the FX swap, leaving the US subsidiary  in the same position as if it had acted  independently; and  • Without concentration, investing the   euro locally in Paris.  Difference = benefit or loss The difference between  With  and    Without  will be the net benefit, or   the net loss.  With X - (Without) (X)  = Benefit/(loss) X/(X)  Business skills Qualifications    With concentration The concentration in US dollars, with an FX  swap, needs four steps: (1) Swap €8m into dollars. (2) Interest on the combined dollars deposit. (3) US subsidiary s independent position. (4) Swap back the balance of dollars  into euro.  With c With concentration $k Steps  €8m swapped   + Subsidiary s own funds  = Combined $ deposit   + Interest added  = Maturing deposit  (Retained by subsidiary)  10,000  5,000  15,000  18  15,018  (5,006)  (1)  (2)  (3)  $k to swap back 10,012 (4)  (1) Swap €8m into dollars The near leg exchange rate is USD/EUR  0.8000. We re calculating to the base  currency USD. So divide the variable  currency €8,000k by this rate: 8,000k/0.8000 = $10,000k  (2) Interest on combined dollar deposit $15,000k x 0.24% x 180/360 = $18k  (3) If US subsidiary had acted  independently Dollar interest income, to the nearest $k: $5,000k x 0.224% x 180/360 = $6k  Independent cash at end: $5,000k + $6k = $5,006k  The US subsidiary must be left in the same  final position as if it had acted independently.  So this amount is retained in the US.  (4) Swap back into euro Far leg exchange rate, USD/EUR, deducting  the 180-day points of 6 (= 0.0006): 0.8000   0.0006 = 0.7994  We re calculating from the base currency  USD. So multiply the base currency $10,012k  by the far leg rate:  Doug Williamson is a  treasury and finance coach  10,012 x 0.7994 = €8,004k  This is the cash in euro at maturity,  With   the FX swap and concentration. Now we  need to compare that result against the   Without  independent alternative.  Without concentration, investing  €8m in Paris Euro interest income without an FX swap,  instead investing directly in Paris: €8,000k x 0.05% x 180/360 = €2k  Cash at end: 8,000 + 2  = €8,002k  Net benefit  €k  With concentration  Without: independent  8,004  (8,002)  Benefit 2  TSA is better off by €2k, with the   temporary concentration in US dollars.   The dollar position of the US subsidiary   is identical under both alternatives.   So it s beneficial to undertake the  temporary concentration in dollars, on   the basis of this comparison.  Other factors In practice, we need to take account of a  number of other important issues, including: • Administrative time; • Bank fees and charges; •  Any uncertainty in the cash-flow    forecasts in each currency; and • Counterparty risks.  These may change our decision.   Different rates If the exchange rates were different, the  net benefit of €2k we calculated previously  might become greater, smaller or even a   net loss. Try recalculating the results with  180-day points of 9 deducted, rather than 6. All other information remains the same.  What s changed? Steps (1) to (3) are unchanged. The only  difference is the re-exchange of dollars into  euro, in our final step (4).  The far leg exchange rate will become: 0.8000   0.0009 = 0.7991  The EUR proceeds from swapping back  $10,012k are now: 10,012 x 0.7991 = €8,001k  Worse off The overall comparison becomes:   €k  With concentration  Without: independent  8,001  (8,002)  Loss (1)  Now we re worse off with the temporary  concentration, by €1k.  How did that happen? The reason we re worse off is that FX loss  has increased. The FX loss now exceeds the  interest benefit, by €1k.   With these exchange rates, it would be  loss-making to undertake the temporary  cash concentration. So we wouldn t do it on  the basis of these exchange rates. We should  either decline the opportunity, or negotiate  for better rates.  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer October 2016 The Treasurer  57  HELP FOR   ACT STUDENTS  Download further useful study  information from the student site   you are assigned to: either the  Resources area of the ACT Learning  Academy at learning.treasurers.org  or the Exam Tips area of the ACT  Study Site at study.treasurers.org    The 110km   regulatory hurdles The traditional hurdles   race is extended from  110m to 110km. The height  of the hurdles varies, as  does the spacing between  them. Moreover, during the  course of the race, hurdles  are moved, repositioned,  heightened, shortened  and (very rarely) removed  altogether, with little or no  warning. Each hurdle has   its own particular set of rules,  which treasury athletes must  read before attempting to leap  over them. At the conclusion  of the race, the whole thing  starts all over again.
