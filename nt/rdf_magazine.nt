The atrocities will surely only deepen the fissures and doubts. Can we continue to stick with  Angela Merkel s welcoming ethos towards refugees? Does doing so fundamentally jeopardise  our collective security? And if we abandon that policy of keeping borders open, what, in any  case, would reversing the rules look like? Schengen is in tatters and nationalism is on the rise    localised pockets of nationalism, perhaps, but nevertheless, they are there.  Another open question is whether the bombings in Brussels make a vote in the UK to leave  the EU more likely. The question  do UK citizens collectively want to leave the European Union?   was not framed with these security issues front and centre   not at all. And for businesses and  treasurers, the question remains one of the practicalities of how we arrange our socioeconomic  and political combined interests within Europe. As Colin Tyler points out, on page 19, a no vote  would still commit the UK to the financial regulation that has been in place since 2008, and  bilateral trade and administrative agreements will remain a necessity. Quite simply, corporates  will always need sound and solid trade accords and agreements to operate across borders. But the  attacks in Brussels and Paris are attacks on European unity. How realistic is it that, in the minds   of UK voters, those issues will remain separate?  We look closely at business decision-making in our lead feature. Management has always been  a blend of weighing data and evidence against the intangibles of experience, and even instinct.  Setting up new operations and operating across borders sets distinctive challenges on that front.  Management journalist and writer Simon Caulkin explores the data versus instinct debate on   page 24 and we look, too, at how treasurers weigh those decisions in relation to operating in  emerging markets.  Staying with our emerging-markets theme, Semih Ozkan explores the south-south corridor    the relationship between Africa, Asia and the Middle East, on page 30, and we also look at the  rising importance of panda bonds to investors as the barriers around China s financial machinery  loosen, on page 36.

SOURCE: THE INDEPENDENT,   3 MARCH 2016   WORDS  06  The Treasurer April 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  { CORPORATE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT }  MMF REFORMS HIGHLIGHT   NEW METRICS FOR INVESTORS  Reforms to Money Market Funds  (MMFs) taking effect this month   will affect how investors assess   their cash investment strategies,  according to a report from HSBC  Global Asset Management.  The US Securities and Exchange  Commission s (SEC s) amendments  to Rule 2a-7 of the Investment  Company Act 1940 herald structural  changes to the way MMFs are  operated. The report, Impacts  of Money Market Reform, argues  that the reforms will bring two  new investment metrics to the  foreground: daily market-based   net asset values (NAVs) and weekly  liquid asset levels.  From this month, funds will be  obliged to disclose daily market- based NAVs. In October, when  more MMF reforms come into  play, funds will also be required  to transact based on the measure.  Institutional and large corporate  investors will need to keep a close  eye on NAV fluctuations in order  to limit any losses, says the report s  author, Barry Harbison, North  American head of liquidity product  at HSBC Global Asset Management.  Disclosure of weekly liquid asset   levels also begins from April.  However, from October this year,  fund boards will be able to impose  liquidity fees or redemption gates.  These risk controls are compulsory  for some funds, but costly for  investors   hence the need to  monitor weekly liquid asset levels.  The SEC s reforms are intended  to address MMFs  vulnerability  to heavy redemptions in times of  stress and increase transparency on  their risks. However, these reforms  have already caused fund managers  and investors to migrate to other  vehicles, such as government funds.   { QUESTIONS YOUR FD IS LIKELY TO ASK THIS MONTH }  THE ECB AND INTEREST RATES What s going on at the ECB? Plumbing the depths of monetary  policy is how one analyst described the  latest developments at the European  Central Bank (ECB), which cut its main  interest rate from 0.05% to 0% and  trimmed the deposit rate from minus  0.3% to minus 0.4%  Additionally, the ECB has expanded  its programme of quantitative easing  (QE), from €60bn a month to some  €80bn. It s a response to gloomy  economic indicators   share  prices and confidence are  on a downward path.  Economists have cut  their expectations for  growth and inflation  for most countries. All  of this puts pressure on  central bankers to act.  Surely QE is just more of the same  medicine? What s different this time? What makes this latest announcement  different is a cluster of targeted  measures that are intended to increase  bank lending. The ECB will be buying  corporate, as well as government,  bonds. That, in theory at least, will  make it easier for companies to raise  funds through the bond market.  By taking the deposit interest  rate further into negative territory,   the ECB is seeking to boost  lending. However, it s worth   remembering that  negative rates mean  contracting income  for banks from central  bank reserves along  with contracting lending   to the private sector.  What are the long-term implications  of negative interest rates? The danger is that while banks pass  on poorer interest rates to depositors,  households and businesses are more  likely to just hold the cash rather than  entrust it to a bank. That, in turn,  erodes banks  ability to lend and  creates a credit crunch. We all know  how that can end…  With its latest decision, the ECB was  seeking to offset the effect of negative  interest rates on banks  profits by  providing long-term funding for banks  at low, or even negative, rates. Any light at the end of the tunnel? If the current set of policy measures  proves insufficient, the ECB could ramp  up its QE programme and widen the  range of assets that can be purchased  under the scheme.  SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K     { CONTEXT OF TREASURY }  Cyber risk in internal audit    Organisations are more likely than ever to evaluate  cybersecurity risk as part of their internal audit   cycle. According to a survey from consultancy Protiviti,  73% of companies now include an evaluation of cyber  risks within their internal audit process, a 20%  year-on-year increase.   More than half (57%) of firms said the increased focus  on cyber risk came at the prompting of customers, clients  or insurance companies, but Protiviti s survey found  that a high level of board engagement in information  security risks along with evaluating cyber risk as part of  the internal audit plan were critical to maintaining an  effective focus on information security risk.  Some 92% of organisations with a high level of board  engagement on this issue have a cybersecurity risk  strategy in place. And 83% of companies that include  cybersecurity assessments within their internal audit  have a risk policy.   The rapidly evolving sophistication of cyberattacks  is one of the hottest topics of today s digital age,”  said Mark Peters, MD of internal audit at Protiviti.   Our survey found that when it comes to assessing  cybersecurity measures and the auditing processes,  the highest-performing organisations have audit  committees and boards that actively engage with   the internal audit function during the discovery   and assessment of these risks.”  Meanwhile, the UK government has created a  National Cyber Security Centre to help businesses  boost their defences against cyberattacks.  { CONTEXT OF TREASURY }  Compliance officers under pressure  as new regime comes into force   As the UK s Senior  Managers Regime   (SMR) takes effect,  opinion is divided   as to whether it will  improve compliance with  financial institutions   or make compliance   roles untenable.  According to one   view, the new rules   could result in the  unintended consequence  of making those   roles unattractive   to many compliance  professionals, since  the rule changes make  those individuals  criminally responsible for  compliance failures. The   level of responsibility  could lead to a shortage  of suitable managers.   The need for well- trained compliance  professionals has never  been more pressing,” said  Chrisol Correia, head  of international AML  compliance at LexisNexis  Risk Solutions.  With  the regulators banking  reforms and changes  to accountability, the  importance of the  compliance role has   risen dramatically.   That said, SMR could  actually increase the   risk of compliance  failures in the financial   sector. This is because  skilled candidates are  being deterred from  working in positions   that carry such high  levels of accountability.”  Under the regulations,  senior managers   within banks and other  financial firms will   need to take reasonable  steps to prevent a  significant breach of a  regulatory requirement  from occurring. It   will be down to the  regulator, the Financial  Conduct Authority,   to prove that the   individual did not take   reasonable steps.  NUMBERS   The attempt to create a monetary union has  been damaging economically and it has been  damaging politically within the euro area.  There are no good ways out of it. It s only   a question of the least bad way.” Mervyn King, former governor of the Bank of England,  voices his continuing opposition to the single currency.   www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer April 2016 The Treasurer  07  What do you say?

The owner of the New York  Stock Exchange, ICE, is  expected to issue a counter- bid for the LSE.  Brexit funds The Bank of England has  announced contingency  plans against a possible  yes   vote in June by saying it will  allow banks to borrow as  much as they need in the days  immediately before and after  23 June, so as to protect them  from running out of funds  in the event of a leave vote.  The UK s central bank will  give commercial banks three   exceptional opportunities  to  borrow in an effort to prevent  a repeat of fund shortages,  such as those that occurred   in 2007 and 2008. The move  has been interpreted as a  sign of nervousness about  the outcome of June s EU  membership referendum.  Emerging-market volatility Moody s has downgraded  its outlook on China from  stable to negative over  concerns about rising debt  and falling foreign reserves.  And in Brazil, figures on the  economy revealed that it has  shrunk by 3.8% in 2015, its  worst recession since official  records began. Brazilians  took to the streets in protest  last month, when president   Dilma Rousseff appointed  Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva  to a cabinet post, in spite  of charges he faces in the  Petrobras scandal.  Global oil prices  Oil may have bottomed out,  according to the International  Energy Agency, which claims  cuts in output this year are  likely to be greater than  anticipated. Markets reacted  favourably, with the oil  ministry in Qatar saying that  an initial agreement between  the big oil-producing nations  to freeze output had  put a  floor under the price .   INTERNATIONAL BRIEFING  { CONTEXT OF TREASURY }  FINTECH PLAYERS  TO MAKE INROADS  ON TRADITIONAL  FINANCIAL FIRMS  Financial services firms say  almost a quarter of their   business could be at risk from  fintech players, according to PwC.  According to a study from the  Big Four accountants, 23% of the  business currently carried out by  traditional financial institutions  could be captured by fintech  players by 2021.   In Blurred lines: How FinTech   is shaping Financial Services, PwC  says global, cumulative investment  in the fintech sector could exceed  $150bn over the next three to   five years.  The survey highlights that 83%  of companies in the traditional  financial services market say they  are at risk of losing some business  to stand-alone fintech firms.  Two thirds (67%) of financial  services firms see pressure on  margins as the top threat to the  business, followed by 59%, who  believe loss of market share is the  key concern.  Among the fund transfer and  payments industry, incumbent  players say up to 28% of their  market share could be lost to  fintech players. Banks estimate   that they could lose 24%, while  asset and wealth management  players put the figure at 22%.  A surprising one quarter of the  financial services sector says it  currently has no interaction with  fintech companies. Steve Davies,  EMEA fintech leader at PwC, said:   Given how fast technology is  changing and lines are blurring,   no business can afford to rest on its  laurels. As competition hots up, the  result will be a reduction in margins  and a loss of market share for  traditional financial institutions.  Those who do not act now are at  risk of falling behind as fintech  changes the industry from the  outside.

The so-called Tobin tax, aimed at  reining in currency speculation, would  represent the most interventionist  measure yet on the part of China s  policymakers, calling into question   its willingness to move towards a more  open economy.   The new policy would curb  speculative bets against the Chinese  currency by imposing a tax on FX  transactions. However, the levy would,  say critics, be insufficient on its own  to ease currency volatility and may  also have the undesirable effect of  undermining China s efforts to create   an international reserve currency.  It would have a negative impact on  international markets and investors,  suggesting that existing capital controls  are not sufficient to limit capital  outflows, commentators suggest.  The Tobin tax is named after US  economist James Tobin, who suggested  taking a cut from FX trades as a   means of limiting currency speculation  in 1972.   The tax has a mixed history, however.  In Sweden in the 1980s, for instance,  a Tobin tax resulted in significant  amounts of trading activity moving   to other markets. More recently, efforts   to introduce an EU-wide Tobin tax have  failed to take hold.  Meanwhile, figures from the People s  Bank of China suggest that central   bank moves to curtail the flow of money  leaving the country have already had   an impact. FX reserves dropped by  $29bn for February to $2.3 trillion,  significantly lower than the more usual  $100bn fall.  China s currency is due to be included  in the International Monetary Fund s  reserve currency basket from October.

A research note from the ratings agency  focusing on activity in Europe, the Middle  East and Asia indicated that, while covenant  protection is likely to remain weak, further  erosion of covenants looks unlikely.   Both sponsor- and non-sponsor-driven  transactions saw weak covenant protection  in 2015 overall, the ratings agency said.  However, Moody s researchers expect   high-yield bond investors in Europe to resist  further growth in the size of both restricted  payments and permitted investment  carveouts over the course of 2016. The   carveouts could increase, however, if markets  allow issuers to test investors  appetite for  weaker covenants.  Moody s expects all sponsor-driven  high-yield bonds issued in 2016 to include  a leverage ratio test (LRT) in restricted  payments carveouts. All sponsor-led high- yield transactions will include an LRT due to  the flexibility it provides and the continued  willingness of investors to trade covenant  protection for yield, Moody s said. In 2015,  96% of sponsor-driven deals included an  LRT, compared with 70% for high-yield  transactions in the region as a whole.  Capacity to incur additional quantifiable  debt will plateau in 2016 at around the same  levels seen last year and in 2014, Moody s said.  Road to recovery in the Med  Cyprus has successfully   exited its €10bn international  bailout programme, marking   a significant turnaround for   the beleaguered Mediterranean  economy. Three years after  the Cypriot economy was  bailed out, EU officials have  confirmed that the rescue  programme will have concluded  by the end of March. In 2013,  the Cypriot economy faced  a broken banking system, a  high deficit and an inability to  access external funding. Cyprus  borrowed €7.5bn against a  €10bn rescue facility. Cyberattack on Bangladesh s  central bank In one of the biggest  cyberattacks to date, hackers  stole $81m from Bangladesh s  official account held at the  Federal Reserve Bank of New  York. Hackers are believed to  have targeted some $950m   in separate attacks, attempting  to execute a number of  transactions between New York  and accounts in Sri Lanka and   the Philippines.   The crime came   to light following  press reports in   the Philippines,  where the  criminals are  thought to be  based. The New  York bank holds  the deposits of  many of the world s  central banks.  Bangladesh uses   the account held   in New York for  international settlements. SFO ends FX fraud enquiry  with no charges brought  The UK s Serious Fraud Office  (SFO) has announced that,  after reviewing more than half  a million documents, there  is insufficient evidence to  begin a prosecution against  banks or individuals relating  to FX fraud.  While there  were reasonable grounds to  suspect the commission of  offences involving serious  or complex fraud, a detailed  review of the available evidence  led us to the conclusion that  the alleged conduct, even if  proven and taken at its highest,  would not meet the evidential  test required to mount a  prosecution,” the SFO said.      Selfie-worth  Retail giant Amazon has filed  a patent for technology aimed  at authenticating payments  with facial recognition  capability.

There is a huge degree of  uncertainty, both about the  outcome of the vote, and the  consequences of the decision  on both the UK and the EU.  But one thing is already clear    irrespective of the outcome,  things will change.  Given that the UK is not  in the eurozone, any exit  from a financial markets  perspective should be  relatively uncomplicated,  but the real challenge will  lie in resolving trading  relationships and that will  inevitably translate back into  treasury operations.  Treasurers need to be  prepared for discussions  with their boards   and even  if they don t yet have many  answers, they should at least  start to identify the questions  they should be asking  of their businesses and  financiers. Areas to consider  might include:  Corporate structure: > Will your organisational  structure need to change?  •  Will the underlying  business strategy of the  organisation change   post referendum?    For example, will the   decision be taken to  exit certain markets?  > How will the working  capital cycle be affected?  •   Will it be materially  lengthened, for example?  Risk management: > What might happen   to the pricing of the  organisation s whole range   of financial products?  •  Uncertainty   drives volatility.  •  Credit ratings (and  spreads) may be adjusted,  particularly if sovereign  credit ratings move   post referendum.  Risk reporting needs to be  expanded to cover all of these  issues   and shared widely  across the organisation to  capture  left-field  risks and  ensure open communication  across the organisation.  Treasurers need to  really understand their  organisation, and understand  how their business may need  to change as a result of the  referendum in June.

If so, how?  •  How will any changes in  the strategic plan impact  the balance sheet   and  hence company valuation  and covenants?   Funding: > Will the sources of   finance change?  •  Will particular markets   or products no longer   be available?    For example, European   Investment Bank loans  or EU-funded grants.  > Will bank  relationships alter?  •  Some banks may exit  particular lines or  geographical areas   of business.  •  Some banks may   no longer meet your  investment criteria  (particularly post  bank  ring-fencing / restructuring, which is  taking place concurrently  to the Brexit debate).

Following two consultations in  May and September 2015, the  Legal Entity Identifier Regulatory  Oversight Committee (LEI ROC)  has produced a report setting out  the different uses of information  on parent entities, data collection  and validation.   Entities that have or acquire an  LEI would report their  ultimate  accounting consolidating parent   defined as the highest-level legal  entity preparing consolidated  financial statements, as well  as their  direct accounting  consolidating parent . In both  cases, the identification of   the parent would be based   on the accounting definition   of consolidation applying to   this parent.   According to the LEI ROC, some  420,000 entities worldwide have  acquired an LEI. The information  collected would be published   in the Global LEI System and      therefore be freely available for  public authorities and market  participants. A pilot study is to be  carried out examining issues with  collecting data on parents that do  not have an LEI.   Implementation is planned  to start in the fourth quarter of  2016.

Visibly  quaking before the  onslaught of public   opprobrium and the UK s  dreaded  diverted profits   tax , both Google and now  Facebook have caved in and  agreed to pay a  fair share    of UK corporation tax. Other  American tech giants will  surely follow. Or so the UK  government would have you  believe. But is this really   the triumph in tax policy  claimed? Hardly.  Something is better than  nothing, and both companies  will now pay more than they  used to. But on all kinds   of fronts, the situation  remains far from satisfactory.  Google s tax settlement,  which is hardly being seen   as the gesture of goodwill   the company intended,   has turned into a public  disaster, with the £130m  agreed for back taxes and  interest widely derided as  pitifully inadequate.  It was hard to know who  came out of it worse: Google,  for its vanishingly small  contribution to Britain s  struggling public finances,  or Her Majesty s Revenue  & Customs, which was  hopelessly outgunned by   the internet giant. Either   way, it has put the whole   tax avoidance row right   back in the political spotlight.  Back-room,  sweetheart  tax  deals of this sort are always   unequal contests. The three  or four relatively poorly paid  tax inspectors the revenue  would have had on the case  would have been no match for  the massed ranks of Google s  tax and legal advisers.  Facebook s concessions to  the UK taxman at least have  the merit of being a little  more transparent, with the  company agreeing to book  UK advertising through  Britain, rather than Ireland,  with its more favourable  rate of corporation tax. Even  so, it won t satisfy public  concern about the way big  multinationals meet their  international tax obligations.  You can explain the  fundamentals of corporate  tax until you are blue in the  face   including the basic  principle that it applies only  to where the money is earned,  not where the revenue is  generated   but it won t make  a blind bit of difference to the  public s sense of injustice.  A couple of points seem  worth making. One is that the  fault lies as much in the US tax  system, which attempts to tax  companies on the entirety of  their worldwide profits rather  than just US ones, as it does  its European counterparts.  Punishingly high rates of US  corporation tax positively  encourage US companies to  avoid tax overseas and then  hold the profits offshore to  help defray the tax bill back   home and limit the risks of  double taxation.  It is an interesting  observation on the  corporation tax debate  that the sense of injustice  works both ways. Many  US lawmakers accuse their  European colleagues of  attempting to steal tax  revenue from the US. In  any case, not until Congress  addresses the shortcomings  of its own tax system is the  problem likely to diminish.  The other observation  concerns the very nature   of corporation tax. Almost   by definition it is bound to   be an unsatisfactory form   of taxation, if only because  profit is such a slippery  concept. The Organisation for  Economic Co-operation and  Development s Base Erosion  and Profit Shifting initiative   is unlikely to provide the  solution. It s not just the  public, but business, too, that   regards the tax as arbitrary  and unfair.  If a tax isn t working,   it should be got rid of and  replaced with something  else. In Britain, many large  companies now pay more  in business rates than they  do corporation tax. No one  would regard business rates    effectively a tax on property    as a good alternative, but it  is possible to envisage many  others. The time has come   for a radical rethink of  business taxes in the round.  There is no point in trying   to patch up what is already   a broken system.

This mismeasurement problem has  exacerbated negative market perceptions  that China is cooling too quickly.  Second, markets do not like surprises.  They rarely go down well. Two bungled  devaluations of the yuan, the first last  August and the second in January this  year, highlight China s communication  challenge. In recent years, unit labour  costs have soared and the yuan has  appreciated significantly on a trade- weighted basis. This has cut into China s  competitive edge and contributed to  declining exports. Therefore, a modest  depreciation of its currency is an  appropriate adjustment and a positive  for China s economy. Worries about yuan  devaluations, misguided though they  are, stem from a lack of communication.  Although they reflect a necessary   Following decades of booming  growth, China s economy has begun  to slow. But despite a fearful reaction   by financial markets, China is not  heading for a hard landing. Instead,   the world s second-largest economy   is gradually losing momentum as it  transitions from an investment- and  export-oriented industrialiser to a   cleaner and more developed services and  consumer-driven economy. Nevertheless,  investors are clearly apprehensive. China   is having a hard time convincing markets  that it can cope with the challenges of   a maturing economy.  Part of the problem is that it is quite  difficult to know what is going on in  China. Risk tends to move in the opposite  direction to the degree and quality of  information. Indeed, ex-Federal Reserve  chairman Ben Bernanke spent his  academic days illustrating that it was  in part the loss of information as banks  failed during the Great Depression   that caused borrowing costs to rise   so terrifically. Partly as a result of this,  economic policymakers in the Western  world try to ensure that markets are  always in the know. A huge amount  of resources are assigned the task of  accurately counting all of the bells,  whistles and widgets in an economy.   It is in these quarters that China faces   its real dilemmas.  First, the perceived unreliability of  Chinese economy data has led many  analysts and economists to build their  own proxies to track the true underlying  rate of economic growth. But these   have become outdated and unreliable.  Most of them look at manufacturing  data to track underlying growth. These  probably worked a decade ago, but   not any more. Out-of-date growth  indicators that focus on China s    adjustment to help China regain some  competitiveness, markets reacted on   both occasions as if the devaluations   were a drastic policy response to deep  economic malaise. Why? Because the  moves were not properly communicated.  The Chinese economy has reached   a size where it has become systemically   important for the world. The developed  world is only just back on its feet from  the global financial crisis and is facing  its own political headaches. Markets  worry that a Chinese hard landing could  throw the global economy into recession.  Nevertheless, as has happened many  times before, markets tend to over- rather  than under-react to events. Regarding the  slowdown in China, this is probably one  of those times.  In any case, if China was experiencing  something more sinister than a modest  slowdown, there is ample policy  headroom to buffer demand if needed.  A savings rate of over 40% signals a  significant amount of pent-up demand  if the right levers are pulled. Plus, low  inflation and a policy rate above 4% mean  that monetary policy can be aggressively  scaled up if needed. Finally, China still  sits on $3.2 trillion of foreign reserves, the  largest stock in the world more than twice  over. Altogether, this means that China  has the tools to both stabilise its own  economy and see out the financial market  turbulence until it either learns how to  manage its own growing pains or until the  panic subsides, whichever comes first.

Most banks  and especially relationship  managers are keen not to be  seen to drop out of syndicates    it is a sign of weakness  to do so, but we corporate  treasurers cannot take this   for granted indefinitely.  However, there are   a number of areas where  banks are not as supportive  as before. It seems to me  that a number are narrowing  their offerings and some  have dropped out of certain  markets that were well  supplied a few years back.  They should then hardly  complain when corporates  have to look outside their   After agreeing the latest  round of bank financing,  we proposed that a series   of annual review meetings  with banks be set up. These  were to be formal: the  relationship managers would  not just call in for a coffee, but  would have to appear to be  demonstrating to their credit  and business committees that  their funds were earning them  a suitable return.  The reviews were duly set  up, and a series of fairly senior  London bankers trekked to  our office. We did think of  holding them at one of our  sites, but decided we were  likely to struggle to offer as  much business to them so had  better keep it local in London.  We were thoroughly  prepared, with metrics on  trades, drawdowns and  responsiveness. I started   a sweepstake on how many  times during the meetings  the phrase  ancillary business   would come up   we needed  to move to spread betting  when it exceeded 100. I knew  this would be the key topic.  The meetings all seemed  to follow a similar pattern    review of the year, review   of the business, summary   and feedback on team  members to flatter the  relationship manager, and  then the meaty questions: • Why have we not had   enough (ancillary) business? • What do we have to    do to win more   (ancillary) business?  • We are really hurting due  to pricing and regulation  and capital costs   what can  you do to help us gain more  (ancillary) business?  I donated my winnings   to charity, in case you   were wondering.  The reality is that there was  not enough pie to go around.  It sounded to me like each  bank had promised their  committees that they would  get a bookrunner mandate  in the first few years of the  relationship, and to satisfy  this we would have to do more  debt capital market issues  than needed, just to appease  the banks. That was not going  to happen in practice. How  could this ever be possible in  normal circumstances, and  especially with credit markets  looking as they are at present?  { TREASURY INSIDER }  Is there enough pie  to go around?

There will, in the coming  years, be tough decisions  to make. In my mind I was  projecting forward, say, three  years to think when we may  need to roll the loans again  as to how supportive banks  would be in future. If we, like  others, started to use the wider  range of technologies that may  lead to disintermediation away  from the main banks, whether  it be digital currencies  or other fintech where  traditional institutions might  not be the main players,  then revolving credit facility  pricing may change.  That may be a very different  conversation, and while there  will need to be innovation  from all and focus on the   key value-adding services  banks can provide and  corporates really want, the  whole future of relationship  banking and pricing will  surely remain in focus.   In future it may be the  corporates having to eat  humble pie! Will there be  enough to go around?

SET YOURSELF UP FOR A SUCCESSFUL  CAREER IN TREASURY  treasurers.org/progress  018_ACT_Apr2016.indd   18 24/03/2016   09:57     At the time of writing,  much of the British press  was awash with endless   polls, debates, arguments and  social media overload about  Brexit (or Bremain!).  Like everyone else, the ACT  is looking to discern some clear  paths whatever the outcome  of the UK s referendum. There  is, of course, a great deal of  uncertainty currently about  the outcome of the vote   and the consequences that  would follow, whatever  the result. The ACT has  published a briefing   note on Brexit (see   www.treasurers.org/brexit- briefing) that seeks to identify  the areas where corporate  treasurers may wish to start  scenario planning the possible  outcomes. And let s emphasise  that the experience of any  two companies in terms of  outcomes will be very different.  It s worth pointing out   that, similar to say, Canada   or Japan, membership of   the overarching G20  committee commits the   UK to the financial regulation  we have implemented since  2008. Continued access to  EU markets post a Brexit  would require we maintain  equivalence with EU  regulation. In simple terms,  the UK s continued position  (with approximately 40%  of the EU financial services  market) would require  CRD, European Market  Infrastructure Regulation,  and Markets in Financial   Instruments Regulation and  Directive, and much more to  survive Brexit in a UK form.  As an international  organisation, however, with  members and students in  more than 100 countries, the  ACT has long since taken  an international perspective  on all things treasury. For  example, the recent ACT Cash  Management Conference  brought together more  than 200 cash and treasury  professionals over two days  from across the EU and   further afield to address the  fast-changing environment of  geopolitical shifts, regulatory  change and technological  innovation in cash and  liquidity management  wherever the real economy   is doing business.   I have lamented before  that we don t have a fully   functioning crystal ball, which  makes it rather difficult to  be anywhere near precise.  However, I think it reasonable  to say that the direction, and  in particular, the speed of  evolution in business, finance  and treasury is towards  disintermediation of many of   the structures we have carried  over from the 20th century. If  I had to predict a single word  that will sum up 21st-century  finance, it will be transparency.   That s not a simple response  towards distributed ledger  technology (blockchain as  it s called)   although it will  play its part   rather that the  principles of modern societies  are demanding openness and  technology is the tool that  provides leverage. This isn t   a political view necessarily,   but an economic one. How   do I find out about it? Who   am I doing business with?  Who am I selling to? Where  is my money in the financial  system? How do I manage my  own savings or pension?  So what role do we, should  we, as treasurers, play? In my  view, we will act as the pivot for  these fundamental changes by  standing between the financial  world and what it offers our  organisations and the needs  of our organisations in terms  of the business strategies  treasurers have helped to  create and that will help to  drive growth and prosperity.  I would be delighted to  discuss these ideas with as  many of you as I can, so   I look forward to meeting as  many of you as possible at the  ACT events we have in our  spring calendar, particularly  the Annual Conference in  Liverpool, in May.

One of the real strengths of  the centre was that they had got used to crisis and have developed  really strong and progressive risk management thinking,” says  Drew.  My team was particularly strong at modelling different  types of scenarios and kept reminding me that the storm of the  century happens every 20 years rather than 100 years.”   While in Asia, Drew also experienced first hand the ways  that China was opening up the renminbi. In August 2011, Tesco  issued a renminbi dim sum bond out of Hong Kong.  We were  one of the first international businesses to do this, so we had  to get lots of permissions and assurances from the governors of  the People s Bank of China,” recalls Drew.  It was a market that  they were really promoting, so we wanted to do it. Being one   of the first, we did encounter certain difficulties, but it became  a lot easier, even just during the couple of years that I was there.  It is good for market forces that this is so much easier today.”   Joining a UK institution In 2014, Drew moved back to the UK and into his current  treasury role at the John Lewis Partnership.  In some ways,   I was attracted by the organisation and the people ahead   of the role itself,” says Drew.  I knew this was a company   I wanted to get into. The role is incredibly broad. I remember  the first couple of weeks thinking that I probably should talk  to someone in investor relations about something, only for  someone to say that they thought this was my responsibility,  as we only had  debt  and  debt-like  investors. That would be  quite a quick conversation!”   Reflecting the broad nature of the role, a recent  realignment has seen finance strategy and pensions join the  treasury department. A key focus is to get asset and liability  management right. The Partnership has a large financial  liability with its open defined benefit pension, as well as   bonds, operating leases, cash and a lot of really good property.   The change in structure to bring strategy and pensions in   with treasury is to bring all of this together and really get  it right,” says Drew.  We also get to lead in some areas that  could be perceived as peripheral treasury, whether it be from   From early on in his professional life, Alan Drew   now  group head of treasury at the John Lewis Partnership    had a curiosity about treasury.  I worked at a regional   building society in a role that had a lot of interaction with the  treasury team,” says Drew.  I quickly got bored of what I was  doing in the mortgages team, but became more and more  interested in what the treasury team was doing.”   Drew progressed to the position of treasury dealer after only  12 months in the role. It was then, by taking international cash  management exams, that Drew discovered there was a lot more  to treasury than the dealing side he had been exposed to. This  encouraged him to swap a financial institution for a corporate  position, by joining electronics retailer Dixons.    In seven years at Dixons, my job changed quite a lot,”  explains Drew, who passed his AMCT in 2005 while at the  retailer.  I ended up assistant treasurer there, via a few roles,  and that saw me cover a lot of different topics. In my last year  there, I wasn t really doing much treasury at all; M&A disposals  took up most of that time.”   It was while working for Tesco in 2011 that Drew moved to  Hong Kong. In his international treasury role, he had been  based in the UK and covering into Asia, but the company knew  at the time that the next couple of years would be very Asia- centric, with specific transactions in the region. With this in  mind, Drew s role flipped, seeing him based in Hong Kong,   but then also covering back into Europe.  One surprise for Drew was that he found Hong Kong to be  run more like an organisation rather than simply a region to  live in that had business or finance as its core employer.  It  really felt like a business   there is a chief executive that runs  Hong Kong,” says Drew.  I was only there for two years, but  you could see and feel them doing things to compete with  other  businesses , such as Singapore and the Free Trade Zone  in Shanghai that was opening up. Hong Kong was having  to move, adapt and keep relevant like a company would  competing against other markets.”   While the 2008 financial crisis hit the Western world hard,  Hong Kong had already experienced the Asian financial crisis,  as well as the SARS medical crisis. This experience of relatively   A SUCCESSFUL  PARTNERSHIP  20  The Treasurer April 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer      22  The Treasurer April 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  building out a property strategy to our pension liabilities   and all the complex inputs into pension risk management.   I like the concept of treasury as an entity broadening out to   be ultimately responsible for the full balance sheet.”  The John Lewis Partnership is focused on being able to  differentiate what it offers to partners compared to what they  could get as an employee at another organisation. An example  of that is the open defined benefit pension scheme, which is  something of a rarity for companies today. Drew and his team  have recently carried out some pension risk management  activities, which will help make the defined benefit scheme   more affordable.    The Partnership is fully committed to providing that  benefit,” explains Drew.  At the same time, the retail  environment is increasingly competitive and trade margins  across all of retail have compressed, particularly in food. Being  able to do one thing while the financial backdrop is pulling  you to do something else is a challenge. There is a real focus  on productivity and efficiency across the Partnership and how  we do that in a way that doesn t distract from the partner and  customer offer that we provide. Balancing all of those things   is not easy or straightforward. It brings a real subtle complexity  to the role that is somewhat unique.”  Project Venice The treasury team at John Lewis spent a big part of 2015  rebuilding the way that cash is managed, how it flows around the  business and the way that it can be managed using the treasury  management system (TMS).  As the project was about rebuilding  the foundations, we called it Project Venice,” says Drew.   That has really transformed what we do because that is just  happening in the background, whirring away in the machine,   while we can invest our time in business engagement, business  partnering and thinking about what the right thing to do is.”  Part of the increased investment in the TMS was to help get  a better handle on real-time cash management and optimising  cash resources. This exercise involves using the Partnership s  existing TMS, but changing the way that treasury interacts  with it, as well as unlocking part of the system that was already  there, but not being used.  We have been looking at a lot of  straight-through processing and automation,” explains Drew.   The approach of using the same thing, but just a bit better,  this fits in with our productivity agenda of using existing assets  a little bit smarter. This has made a real difference; it has freed  up my team s time to work more on finance strategy.”   No Plan B When it comes to funding, John Lewis does not have access to  traditional equity markets. So while other organisations would  think that they could always go to a certain market or ask their  owners for some more money as a Plan B scenario, this isn t the  case for Drew, who possibly would not be very popular if he  just walked round the office with a collection bucket.    We have been looking at different ways of funding the  Partnership. Our predecessors did some of that   one of our    There is a real focus on productivity  and efficiency across the Partnership  and how we do that in a way that  doesn t distract from the partner and  customer offer that we provide”  VITAL  STATISTICS  £10bn Annual gross sales    of the business  88,700 Permanent staff, the   organisation s partners  46 John Lewis shops   across the UK  346 Waitrose supermarkets  1864 The year John Lewis   began trading on  London s Oxford Street  58 The total number    of countries outside the  UK where Waitrose s   growing export  business has   a presence    www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer April 2016 The Treasurer  23  predecessors did a retail bond in 2011 that was a really good  transaction. This opens up another market for us if we need   to or want to.”   Drew explains that the focus over the past year for his  treasury has not been on external debt markets. Rather, they  have been looking inward at the balance sheet and financial  strategy, and looking at funding   pensions, leasings and bank  debt   as an adjusted leverage. The company has to be really  mindful of its balance sheet because, unlike some of its other  retail peers, John Lewis cannot do a rights issue.    We are starting to look at landlords providing leases to us  in the same way as we would a bond investor, providing direct  cash to the business,” explains Drew.  My new team structure  supports this as well. We can make the best decision based on  a holistic view of all assets and all liabilities. We run ourselves  fairly liquid and that liquidity has materially increased over the  past year. This is reflective of our review of the balance sheet  as well as market conditions. We do not know what the future  is going to look like, but what we do know is that we are going  to have to be fairly flexible. The retail market could get rather  bumpy, so we have to get our balance sheet ready for that.”   The treasury at the John Lewis Partnership does use hedging  as a risk management tactic, specifically when it comes to  currency exposures. The John Lewis division brings a lot in  from outside the UK, particularly in areas such as electricals  and homeware. This is less of an issue for Waitrose, where a lot  of the food is UK sourced, but the treasury team is definitely  active when it comes to risk management.   By being able to bring a few other areas of the business into  the treasury area, risk management thinking immediately  picks up inflation risk,” says Drew.  This is definitely the case  when thinking about the pressure on pension liabilities if  inflation rates go up. This may be indirect to treasury, but it  certainly fits within organisational risk.”  A business with a difference The ownership structure of the John Lewis Partnership means  that treasury can have a conversation about the economics of  a transaction over a longer period of time, rather than simply  worrying what it may look like in the financial statements  at a moment in time.  It is about the long-term economics,  and what the best thing economically is for partners and  the Partnership,” says Drew.  For me, it has been absolutely  brilliant that I can think longer term and not worry so much  about how the accountants may perceive or present something;  it is about the underlying nature of the transaction.”   This outlook reflects the nature of the Partnership, which  has been around for more than 150 years. It has its own  constitution, and shares the rare distinction of being one   of the few entities, along with the US and the Kingdom of  Bhutan, of enshrining happiness in its constitution, in this case  the happiness of its partners.  The team and I all feel that we  want to hand over something that is in better shape than when  we started,” says Drew.  That is not something I ve particularly  felt at other organisations I have worked   probably because  you know the owners will change before you do.”   Ben Poole is a freelance writer and editor,  specialising in treasury and transaction banking  ALAN S CV 2014-present  Group head of treasury, John Lewis Partnership 2013-2014  Director, international treasury, Tesco  2011-2013  International treasurer, Tesco 2009-2011  Group treasurer, Signet Jewelers 2001-2008  Treasury analyst, treasury manager,   then assistant manager, Dixons Retail  1999-2001 Treasury dealer,    Norwich & Peterborough Building Society  QUALIFICATIONS Cert ICM (2003, AMCT (2005)  ALAN S TOP TIPS FOR SUCCESS 1  It is important for treasurers to spend as much time with  the business as possible, because we, in treasury, are    not the business.

PROFILE    24  The Treasurer April 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  knowledge Few treasurers would feel comfortable tackling new  territories without relevant data on financial and  business infrastructure. Simon Caulkin weighs   up the data versus instinct debate in management  Like the clown wanting to play  Hamlet, management is a messy,  imprecise craft that aspires to be    a clean-cut, hard-eyed science and   many of its ills stem from the effort   to be something it isn t. Management s  besetting sin shows up most clearly in   its seemingly incurable urge to reduce   all the variables it has to deal with to  numbers. As the strategy guru Igor  Ansoff put it ruefully,  Corporate  managers start off trying to manage   what they want, and finish up wanting  what they can measure.”  The slippage is understandable.  Thinking and making judgements on the  basis of incomplete information   the  most important part of the manager s job    is hard work with little certainty about  the outcome. Doing business across  borders and opening up new markets  raise the stakes higher. So anything that  appears to make decision-making easier,  or less uncertain, is likely to be seized on  with gratitude. Then (over)simplification  is also a principal feature of the academic  thinking on which current governance  and performance management  practices are based, in particular the  assumptions about economic rationality  and individual self-interest without  which the underlying equations about  shareholder value don t work. The  result, both practically and theoretically,  is to turn today s management into a  technology of control that attempts to  minimise rather than capitalise on the  pesky human element.  But in management it pays to be  careful what you wish for.  The only  problems that have simple solutions  are simple problems,” warned  the systems thinker Russ Ackoff.   Problems that arise in organisations  are almost always the product of   interactions of parts, never the action  of a simple part. Treating a single part  destabilises the whole and demands  more fruitless management intervention;  management becomes a consumer of  energy, rather than a creator.”  A good example of this is the near- ubiquitous practice of management by  numerical target. Targets seem plausible.  Yet the reality is that performance in any  but the simplest tasks is multifaceted.  So singling out one or two dimensions  to focus on leaves out others of equal  importance that are harder to measure.  What s measured does indeed get  managed, so as with any incentive, effort  is displaced on to meeting the numbers  rather than meeting the purposes     the target becomes the purpose. All too  often the target is hit, but the point  missed. This is the reason that targets  proliferate: the broader the target, the  cruder the unintended result and the  greater the pressure to add new targets  to compensate. Thus, in the UK, the  nonsense of a target for compassion  in the NHS and lessons that engage  students in schools, respectively to  balance pressures to meet financial  priorities in hospitals and to drive  students through exams to safeguard   a school s place in the league table.  Anyone who has seen The Big Short,   a film account of the sub-prime housing  bubble that eventually culminated in the  great financial crash of 2008, will have  seen how, even in finance, supposedly  the domain of hard numbers, in fact  especially in finance, treating a single part    in this case the incentives of mortgage  salesmen and bond and derivative   traders   can have catastrophic results  for the system as a whole, eventually  consuming all the management energy  of not only Wall Street firms, but of   The    INSIGHT  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer April 2016 The Treasurer  25  knowledge IK  O N   IM A  G ES  /G A  RY  W  AT ER  S  governments, too. Failing to take account  of the effects of the incentives, the banks   risk models were disastrously wrong.  Giving evidence to a house oversight  committee later that year, former Fed  chairman Alan Greenspan lamented:    I made a mistake in presuming that the  self-interests of organisations, specifically  banks and others, were such that they  were best capable of protecting their   own shareholders and their equity in   the firms… I discovered a flaw in the  model that I perceived as the critical  functioning structure that defines how  the world works.”  None of this to deny the importance  of science and data in making and  managing decisions. Of course, they are  crucial. The tricky question is, what kind  and when to use them? MIT s Don Sull  put it well. Business education in the  UK and US, he said, has been construed  more and more narrowly as applied  science, on the fundamental assumption  that there are universal laws that can be  discovered and acted on. But other than  in finance, there aren t.  There are useful  generalisations, but in management,  context, timing, personality and history  are everything. The challenge lies in  developing judgement, knowing which  tool to use rather than reaching for the  hammer every time.”  It s striking that many global  industries are characterised by the  presence of a  positive deviant    a  company that is notably successful  although (or because of) adopting  a completely different management   EXPERIENCE WINS OUT FOR BAT IN AFRICA  British American Tobacco (BAT)  has operated in Africa for 100  years, its products are sold in  nearly all the 55 African countries  and it operates through trading  subsidiaries across 20 African  countries, writes Justin Smith. The digital age has increased the  volume, depth and speed of data  and information that is available.  Our treasury runs on information  ranging from outward-looking  economic and financial market  coverage, to internal cash-flow  forecasts for the trading businesses.  In Africa, information is often   of more mixed quality and limited   coverage compared with much   of the developed world. The major  African economies are covered   well by external and internal  sources of information, but the   rest of Africa has more limited  coverage. The treasury and banking  infrastructure is also less developed,  leading to lags in the transmission  of information.  For BAT s treasury, this calls  upon more reliance upon intuitive  judgement to identify and manage  financial risks, drawing upon central  treasury experience of operating  across the developing world. Our  experience is that speed of   response is often vital. Economies  can turn quickly and financial risks  can rapidly emerge, as the impact  on Africa of the current commodity  bust and oil crisis illustrates.  BAT has implemented a globally  centralised treasury operating  model with a design principle that  there will be very few treasurer  roles retained in the trading  businesses. However, for Africa,   the design has been flexed to retain  integrated treasurers located in   four key Africa business hubs; these  roles provide local insights, monitor  regulatory developments and  enable agile execution in places   where it can be difficult to get  things done. BAT s experience is  that it is valuable to have close  working relationships with banks  that have strong pan-African  footprints. In Africa, the treasurer s  conventional toolbox of financial  instruments is often not available    this requires treasury to have a  collaborative partnership with local  business management and banking  partners to identify and implement  commercial solutions to manage  financial risks.

Think  Apple in high tech, the Swedish bank  Handelsbanken, Berkshire Hathaway  in investment (and management in  general), all of which have prospered  by knowing  which tool to use  for  their purposes, and how. Perhaps  the paradigmatic example is motor  manufacturer Toyota. The Toyota  Production System (TPS) is a wonder   of the management world, almost   single-handedly destroying the notion   of a necessary trade-off between cost  and quality, volume and variety.   No one individual knows exactly how  the TPS works. It is a complex adaptive  system that has been evolving for 60  years, and its chief architect, Taiichi  Ohno, resisted all attempts to codify   it in rules, on the grounds that to do so  would stop managers thinking about the  problems they faced. Its  secret  is that  it learns   in effect, it is the expression  of Toyota s accumulated human capital.  The TPS is highly data and measurement  driven, but the reason that it learns is  that the measures it uses   quality, time  to delivery, for example   relate to its  customer purpose, so any improvement  instantly feeds back to the benefit of   DATA PROVENANCE   A SHORT HISTORY   OF INFORMATION SOURCES  The World Bank Group s Ease of Doing  Business Index was first published in 2003  and began by looking at five business  indicators for 133 economies. Since then,   its reach has grown to 11 indicators for 189  economies. It assesses corruption levels   and access to judicial process country by  country. The ranking for each economy   is posited on the regulatory business  regulation environment for the largest one  or two business cities for each economy.  The rankings assess the ease of starting   a business, registering property, gaining  credit, trading across borders and labour  market regulation among other issues,   but they don t cover measures on  macroeconomic stability or the state of   the financial infrastructure within countries.  Ratings agencies have their origins in the  19th century when Standard & Poor s  arrived on the London banking scene in  1860. The AAA to D rating system goes  back to 1924 when it was introduced by   John Knowles Fitch. Treasurers will have  their own stories with ratings agencies, but  sovereign ratings are an important quick  assessment of a country for companies  with a footprint in emerging markets,  taking in as they do, overall economic  conditions, political stability and capital  market transparency.  Transparency International is a non- governmental body that assesses  corruption levels country by country. Before  setting it up in 1993, Eigen worked for the  World Bank in Africa and Latin America and  has also worked for the Ford Foundation.

His reply:  Shortening the  time between receipt of the order and  getting the money”).   By contrast, a surprising amount of the  measurement companies undertake fails  to provide this insight. Unless it does,  the data will not only not foster learning,  it will keep managers in the dark about  the reality of their customer service    which is why it is often so bad. As long  as this is the case, the much-touted  promise of Big Data to improve decision- making and thus company performance  overall is likely to be elusive.  On the other hand, when good  judgement about measures and data  is allied to strong purpose and flair,  the positive effects can be dramatically  amplified. Thus, Toyota s strategic  decision to develop hybrid engine  plants was a judgement call whose  success was by no means inevitable.  If the decision now gets plaudits, it is  largely because of execution that made  the proposition compelling despite a  relatively high purchase price. Look at  the consequences: although globally  second in output to Volkswagen, Toyota  outranks VW in market capitalisation  and stands eighth in Forbes  2015 list of  most valuable brands as compared with  the German carmaker at 67. Toyota s  long-term vision is of a  dream car   whose emissions will be cleaner than the  air it takes in. Would you bet against it?   Or in technology, compare decisions  taken by Apple under Steve Jobs and  those of Microsoft under Bill Gates. Gates  was by far the more capable technically,  but that didn t prevent Microsoft being  serially wrong-footed by Apple s abrupt  product sidesteps, going far beyond  anything that market-research data would  have sanctioned, leaving Gates baffled  and stymied each time. Under Jobs, Apple  revolutionised (for once no exaggeration)  not one, but four, industries: computers,  music, phones and retail (Apple stores,  widely derided as a vanity project, are  now the most profitable retail real estate  per square foot on the planet). Jobs  had another quality that helped ace his  rival s technical and analytical smarts:  an acute sense of human psychology and  motivation. Jobs was often mocked for   his  reality distortion field , the ability  to project a parallel universe where the  apparently impossible becomes not only  possible, but routine. But the laugh was  on the mockers. The distortion field   worked , Apple employees within its  pull performing feats of innovation and  endurance that other companies could  only dream about.  In their book on evidence-based  management, or the lack of it, Hard  Facts, Dangerous Half-Truths and Total  Nonsense, Stanford professors Jeffrey  Pfeffer and Robert Sutton suggest a way  forward. Numerous surveys suggest that  finance professionals have a healthy  respect for the importance of gut feel  and experience in decision-making, in  some cases trusting them as much as  hard data. That s as it should be. But on  their own they are unreliable decision- making guides, being subject to many   psychological quirks, just as the record  shows that data alone can t provide  the will to take bold, but necessary  decisions (just ask Kodak). What s  required instead is due diligence on  the assumptions and background ideas  brought to bear on important decisions.   If the best research shows, as it does,  that most mergers damage the long-term  financial performance of the acquirer,  there is no traceable link between  high CEO pay and firm performance  (and incentives generally are more  likely to demotivate than motivate).  The benefits of reorganisations and IT  implementation are always over- and  their costs underestimated, so you d  better have good reasons why this time  it will be different. That doesn t remove  ambiguity or the need for judgement,  but it does   slightly   shorten the odds  against getting it right. Decision-making  will never be easy, but that s as it should  be, too: if a computer could do your job,  in the end it probably will.   Simon Caulkin is a freelance writer  specialising in business management  THOMAS NEIDERT, QIAGEN QIAGEN, the molecular biology  instrumentation company, has a footprint  in EMEA and Asia-Pacific. The $1.3bn  revenue company s treasury function  was established in 2008, well into the  company s 30-year history, following an  acquisition that brought a debt of $1bn  into the business.  For QIAGEN, operating in emerging  markets while streamlining cash collection  and treasury processes across the entire  organisation necessitated a more hands- on approach than mere fact-finding about  local regulations and banking services  from a distance.   Thomas Neidert, vice president and  head of global treasury, describes a high  degree of reliance on the experience of  people on the ground.   In regulated markets, especially China,  it would be extremely difficult to effect  certain payments,” he says.  We decided  that for Asia-Pacific we needed to opt for  one bank only and then only deal with one  electronic banking system.”  What the company did with its local  banking decisions in Asia-Pacific and  particularly in China was to rely on the   local knowledge and judgement of staff  on the ground. Neidert describes, for  instance, how he would narrow down  decisions on banks and branches by asking  staff which bank they would choose if they  had to choose between just two banks.   What we did better in APAC than in  EMEA was to talk to colleagues to find  out what we really needed and to really  understand the local issues,” he says.  Even so, when operating in a highly  regulated environment, there are hurdles.   When you re dealing with a bank with  many branches [we were advised to]   take care to avoid anything that could   be considered regulatory shopping,”   he says.    The words corporate   and treasurer go together  like bread and butter, but   non-corporate organisations,  such as governmental  organisations, charities and  housing associations, offer  some alternatives.   Profitability is the measure  of a company s success,  but imagine working at an  organisation that has no  interest in profits and where  every penny is earmarked  to help the less fortunate?  Treasury roles in such  organisations do exist and,  while they come with their  own unique set of pressures,  can be deeply rewarding.  The charity sector Richard Symonds worked   in finance for 20 years, either  as treasurer for UK plcs or  in European head offices of  US multinationals. He was  looking for a new challenge,  and landed the role of  treasury operations manager  at the British Council, a UK  charity that specialises in  international educational   and cultural opportunities.   It has 7,000 employees   and an annual turnover  in the region of £973m,  necessitating the need for   a dedicated treasury team.   The British Council   is a unique organisation;   it is a very interesting   place to work and I would   thoroughly recommend it,”  says Symonds.  We have a  front office and relationship  management team in  London, and a back office at  our shared service centre in   India; it would be impossible  to run the business  otherwise,” he says.  An organisation with   global reach, the British  Council operates in more   than 100 countries, with   over 80 banking partners   and 80 different currencies.  It sends out cash to these  territories and repatriates  cash on a daily basis. The  treasury team manages  its daily FX transactions  on a trading platform and  is looking to introduce a  hedging programme for its  renminbi exposure.  The treasury team is also  tasked with finding the best  prices for its transactional  activity; it recently put out a  couple of tenders for banking  services in the EU and East  Asia to find the best rate.  The role of treasurer is  therefore no less rigorous  than working at a corporate,  says Symonds.  There is a  difference perhaps in the  ethos of the business    working at a not for profit   is a bit more relaxed than   at a corporate without being  any less professional.”  Working in the spotlight But working at a charitable  organisation is not without   its challenges, not least  in terms of funding and  explaining spending decisions  to the public. Charities that  receive government grants,  such as the British Council,  have taken a hit from funding  cuts, and increasingly   have to manage their   finances independently.  28  The Treasurer April 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  IK O  N  IM  A G  ES  The third sector, not for profits and governmental organisations  all provide rewarding berths for treasurers outside of the   corporate world. Farah Khalique investigates  Meet the   non-corporate   treasurers    Jenny Hodgkins, head of  treasury at Network Housing  Group, says:  The sector  has very much moved over  the past few years towards  funding itself more like a  corporate. When I came into  this sector, you had 30- to   40-year funding from banks;  now it is a lot more shorter- term finance.”  Treasurers at not-for-profit  organisations certainly   have to think creatively   in order to borrow as   cheaply as possible, given  government restrictions.  Finding a role Treasury roles at charities  such as the British Council  are few and far between, says  Rachael Crocker, associate  director at headhunter Brewer  Morris. Most charities are  simply too small to justify  hiring a treasury team.  Cancer Research UK was one  of the few charities to have   a dedicated treasurer, but has  now scrapped this position.  However, Oxfam has recently  hired a new head of treasury  and has restructured its  treasury team.  People who move into  these roles are not typically  motivated by the pay  package or career prospects,  says Crocker, but rather an  emotional attachment to the  charity. A cut in salary is to   be expected.   is worth it. Last year, TfL  raised a $400m green bond,  and Kilonback personally  showed investors where  the investment is funding  improvements at Victoria  station and on London s  cycle superhighways.  There  is a real connection with the  business,” he says.  The housing sector Martin Watts, director  of treasury at London  & Quadrant Housing  Association (L&Q) also   cites this connection as   one of the most rewarding  aspects of his job. L&Q is  a housing association and  residential developer, owning  or managing more than  70,000 homes in London   and the South East. When   I meet Watts, who is MCT  qualified, at the head office  in Lewisham, he shakes   my hand and points to a  towering construction site  in the distance   an L&Q  regeneration project.  You can  see the end result of giving  something back,” he says.  L&Q won the bonds below  £500m category in The  Treasurer s Deal of the Year  Awards 2015 for its £250m  bond issue last year. Like  many other publicly funded  organisations, housing  associations have felt the brunt  of government cuts in the  form of the social housing rent  reduction, prompting them  to find new ways to secure  funding and manage costs.   We have to be mindful  of managing public money.  We need to generate our own  cash and projects that provide  returns; we need to focus  on value for money for our  investments,” he says.  Funding constraints   and public transparency   are familiar challenges to  Simon Kilonback, director   of group treasury at Transport  for London (TfL). Every  Londoner has an opinion   on the city s transport system;  newspapers write about it  obsessively and when it fails,  nobody holds back.  TfL, whose team includes  a number of ACT students,  has a fixed amount of funding  from central government   and the mayor, and does  not make a profit, instead  reinvesting all its income   into London s transport  system. This means that the   treasury has real sway with  the board, says Kilonback,  because there is real  opportunity to save much- needed money through  treasury transactions.  TfL faces the challenge   of fully covering its operating  costs by 2019   without   any financial help from   the government. If it hits   that target, it will be one   of the first UK public-sector  organisations of its size  and complexity to do so.   As treasurer, I am heavily  involved in the strategy   of ensuring we get there,”   says Kilonback.  There is no such thing as a  typical day at an organisation  like TfL. On top of running  the day-to-day treasury  activities and figuring out   the financing of billion-dollar  projects such as Crossrail,  Kilonback is also involved  with policy work with  politicians and ministers.  The upside of working in  a public-sector organisation  is the collaborative approach  with other public bodies    something that might be  alien to a corporate treasurer    because there is no direct  competition. Kilonback  might take a call from a  treasurer at a major city or  public-sector body to learn  from TfL s experiences, and is  happy to share his knowledge.  But one of the key  differences from working   as a treasurer in the private  sector is the level of   transparency when managing  public money.   We work in a political,  public-sector environment.  We have to find ways we  can balance the need for  privacy and discretion for  certain transactions with  transparency. You are much  more accountable as the  treasurer of a public-sector  organisation; you can be  called in front of public  committees to explain   why you have done things   in a particular way,”   explains Kilonback.  Despite the high level of  scrutiny, he believes the job   Farah Khalique   is a freelance  business and  finance journalist    www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer April 2016 The Treasurer  29  INSIGHT  Treasurers at not-for-profit organisations have to think  creatively in order to borrow as cheaply as possible    30  The Treasurer April 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Over the past decade, there has  been widespread growth in Africa,  with GDP growth rates averaging   around 5%. This growth has been mainly  attributed to the surge in natural  resources prices: the highest price  increases in world merchandise trade   are to be found in energy, followed by  minerals and non-ferrous metals, which  comprise a large portion of Africa s  exports. Yet this is only part of the story.  Improved government performance in  terms of maintaining political stability  and improving macroeconomic  conditions are also widely recognised   as contributory factors.  Increasing economic momentum   in Africa is changing the region s long- standing commercial relationships  with its trading partners   notably Asia  and the Middle East. The list of Africa s  top 10 trading partners highlights the  importance of the so-called south-south  corridor   trading relationships between  emerging economies   with Asia and the  Middle East accounting for around 33%  of Africa s $726.8bn total trade in 2014.  In Asia, China, India, Japan and South  Korea are leading the way. In the Middle  East, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab  Emirates (UAE) are at the forefront.  Trade among Asian, African and Middle  Eastern countries, estimated at around  $4.1 trillion in 2014, shows the growing   significance and connectivity between  these economies.  The Middle Eastern ports, especially  Jebel Ali, the largest in the region,  are among the biggest beneficiaries.  Between the fastest-growing region  in the world, Asia, and the runner-up,  Africa, the Middle East has a one-of-a- kind opportunity to facilitate not only  bilateral (for example, Middle East/ Africa and Middle East/Asia) trade, but  also intra-regional (for example, Africa/ Asia) trade and investments flows. And  for the Middle East, it is not about one   or the other.   Trade and investment flows  The Middle East and Africa have more  in common than many would expect.  In nature, they are heterogeneous  with largely comparable economic  compositions, ie, natural-resources  and human-capital driven economies  with limited diversification. Both  regions take part in global supply  chains, albeit on a small scale, due to  infrastructure limitations. The World  Trade Organization s (WTO) 2015 report  on international trade statistics show  both regions coded blue   the lowest  rating   putting their trade size in global  perspective. Notwithstanding these  issues, the regions are still benefiting  each other when it comes to growth.   Context of treasury The business context  Africa  connecting Asia, Africa and the Middle East have an increasing  stake in each other s fortunes. Semih Ozkan charts   the south-south corridor    www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer April 2016 The Treasurer  31  The bilateral trade flows between the  Middle East and Africa play a crucial role  in each other s economy   the Middle  East mobilises Africa with refined energy  products, such as gasoline, and Africa s  abundant agriculture output helps feed  the Middle East. In 2014, the regional  trade flows reached $54bn and are  increasing, according to the WTO. What  is more, the region s bilateral footprints  are steadily increasing and broadening  in terms of geographies and sectors.  Emirates, along with other Middle  Eastern airlines, such as Etihad Airways  and Qatar Airways, is fuelling the   Africa connecting  narrative by serving   a collective 742 flights per week and  growing. The Middle East s flagship hotel  brands, such as Jumeirah Group and  Rotana, are also taking steps to build  their footprints in Africa. This ever- increasing connectivity is shaping a   more meaningful role for the Middle  East in facilitating Africa s trade and  investment flows.   Appropriately, Africa is very  high on Middle Eastern treasurers   growth agendas. Etisalat, a leading  telecommunications company in  the Middle East and Africa, serves 10  countries in Africa. Emirates Global  Aluminium, which owns Guinea  Alumina Corporation, a mining  development company, is focused   on advancing its bauxite and alumina  export project in Guinea. DP World,  one of the world s largest port operators,  has more than 3,000 people across six  terminals in Africa and growing. Aramex,  a global logistics and transportation  provider, operates in more than 20  countries in Africa. The promising long- term prospect of Africa is also attracting  institutional investments. Middle  Eastern private equity firm Abraaj Group  raised around $1.4bn for two funds  in 2015 to invest in Africa s consumer  story. Qatar National Bank invested in  Ecobank, the leading pan-African bank.   The Middle East and Africa have more  in common than many would expect…   they are heterogeneous with largely  comparable economic compositions  In turn, the Middle East also  offers a compelling trade and  investment platform for many  African companies. Mediclinic  International, a listed healthcare  company in South Africa, owns  and operates a number of  healthcare facilities in the UAE.  The ease of doing business in the  region is attracting many trading  houses from Africa   Export  Trading Group, one of the most  vertically integrated agriculture  supply chain companies in Africa  with a presence in 30 countries,   is based in the UAE.  Even healthy development can suffer  shocks and face risks and structural  constraints, of course. Ease of doing business: Africa has,   on average, the lowest score (51.87) in   the World Bank s Ease of Doing Business  ranking despite some countries, such  as Mauritius, Rwanda and South Africa  scoring much higher than average.  This low score puts Africa towards the  bottom of the rankings not only in terms  of difficulty of doing business, but also  when it comes to the ability to create  and reinforce rules that facilitate a better  business environment. Having said that,  the past decade has witnessed improved  government performance on this front,  which is contributing notably to the  region s collective long-term prospects. Corruption: Africa, in aggregate,  is coloured with the darkest red on  Transparency International s corruption  index, meaning that almost the entire  region faces severe corruption issues  (although it is by no means the only  region in the world where this is the  case). Despite the bad and the ugly, the  good is still in evidence in the region.  Botswana, Namibia and South Africa are  making meaningful efforts to improve  public access to justice and security, and  to reduce risks for doing business   an  encouraging result for Africa as a whole.   Intra-regional trade flows: According  to the WTO, Africa has one of the world s  lowest intra-regional trade flows, 18%.  In fact, the Middle East has the lowest  intra-regional trade flow (9%), while  Asia has the highest (52%), in the world.  The limited regional supply chains are  caused primarily by: (i) significantly   high cost of intra-regional transportation  due to inadequate infrastructures;  and (ii) imbalanced integration into  the global supply chains due to lack  of considered policies. With trade  dominated by natural resources,  this high cost and underdeveloped  infrastructure will be a drag on growth  unless more supportive economic  policies, such as the development of  related industrial and intra-regional  activity, can be put in place.   Without a doubt, the extent of  these problems is hindering Africa s  growth and, more importantly, the  trade and investment flows in the  south-south corridor. Yet the region  is a land of opportunity and offers  the highest rates of return, second to   Asia, on investments. There are no  straightforward answers to its challenges,  and seizing opportunities requires a  high level of due diligence along with  a willingness to navigate Africa s legal,  political and business environments.  Engaging with Africa s growth  story will also require a long-term  multidimensional strategy, flexibility  and a lot of patience. In this regard,  the Middle East is well positioned with  a natural value proposition   not just  because of its proximity, historical ties  and cultural familiarities with Africa,   but also because of its own infrastructure  and capacity to act as a trading hub.  Middle Eastern companies are in   a position to take the helm in the   complex and diverse region that is   Africa and participate in the  Africa  rising  narrative.

KATIE KELLY SETS OUT THE   ICMA POSITION ON KEY AREAS EARMARKED FOR CHANGE  32  The Treasurer April 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Whys and  wherefores  For almost 50 years, the  International Capital  Market Association   (ICMA) has made a significant  contribution to the  development of international  capital markets, encouraging  interaction between all market  participants: issuers, lead  managers, dealers and investors.  Regulatory authorities have  relatively little exposure to  issuers and generally welcome  the opportunity to engage with  them. One of ICMA s primary  markets groups   the Corporate  Issuer Forum   gathers senior  representatives from major  corporates and focuses on  matters of market practice and  transaction execution, as well  as on the impact of regulation  on issuers, with a view to  feeding back an industry  consensus to regulators.  The cumulative effect  of legislation is in danger  of impeding the proper  functioning of the markets,  a fact acknowledged when  the European Commission  recently invited interested  parties to provide feedback  and empirical evidence on the  benefits, unintended effects,  consistency and coherence  of the financial legislation  adopted in response to the  financial crisis. ICMA works  on many areas of regulation  that have an impact on the  corporate treasurer, just a few  of which are highlighted here.  Bail-in The combination of the bail-  in mechanism under the Bank  Recovery and Resolution  Directive (BRRD) extended  depositor preference in  Europe, ring-fencing proposals  under the Vickers Report  in the UK and the Liquidity  Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules,  which incentivise banks to  encourage deposits of more  than 30 days, means that the  position of non-preferred  depositors is now much more  subordinated, the cumulative  effect of which for banks is a  change in their credit profile.  While it is unlikely that      www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer April 2016 The Treasurer  33  Repo documented by the  Global Master Repurchase  Agreement (GMRA) is based  on transfer of ownership:  it is the immediate sale  and agreement for future  repurchase of equivalent  securities on demand for   the original value. Full  legal title to the securities  is transferred to the buyer  on sale of the securities,  meaning that the buyer has  an unencumbered right of  use of the securities, although  they do retain exposure to the  market value of the securities  (coupon payments, market  movements, etc).  The GMRA is a  comprehensive document  that ICMA has sponsored for  more than 20 years. A central  characteristic of the GMRA is  close-out netting, which allows  banks to account for repo on a  net basis and therefore achieve  balance-sheet netting. ICMA  procures legal opinions from  64 jurisdictions for the use of  its members, which opine on  the efficacy of the GMRA and  speak to the enforceability of  the GMRA and, in particular,  the netting provisions.  In terms of regulatory  impact on repo, the Financial  Stability Board has published  a recommendation that  non-central counterparty- cleared repos between banks  or non-banks (and possibly  between non-banks and  non-banks) should be subject  to mandatory minimum  haircuts on the collateral  value. This has been proposed  in the European Parliament s  version of the Level 1 text  of the Securities Financing  Transactions Regulation,  although there would be an  exemption for repos with  sovereign collateral. Also,  faced with the mandated  dual reporting and proposed  increased disclosure  requirements for repo-type  activities, there is a danger    between the parties, the bank  can automatically assign its  client to either the ring-fenced  or non-ring-fenced area.   Net stable funding ratio The net stable funding ratio  (NSFR) for banks has now  been finalised. The NSFR  requires banks to maintain  a stable funding profile in  relation to the composition   of their assets and off-balance- sheet activities. It is also  intended to limit over-reliance  on short-term wholesale  funding, encourage better  assessment of funding risk  across all on- and off-balance- sheet items, and promote  funding stability. The NSFR   is designed to complement the  LCR, which aims to promote  the short-term resilience of  a bank s liquidity risk profile  under stressed conditions.  The NSFR changes banks   appetite in terms of their  sources of funding, given how  much long-term funding will  be deemed to be created for  them; and which assets they  hold, given how much long- term funding they will have   to hold against them. This will  increase the cost of providing  balance sheet, as banks are  forced to take more long-term  funding, which may mean that  banks are even more reluctant  to allocate balance sheet other  than in those ways that are  more efficient for them.  Repurchase agreement Repurchase agreement (repo)  is a safe and efficient means of  investing cash and is therefore  an ideal investment tool for  corporate issuers seeking an  alternative to bank deposits.  Repo may also be a cheaper  alternative to more traditional  bank credit lines. It is generally  underpinned by liquid  collateral and enjoys two layers  of security: first, the credit  profile of the counterparty;  second, the collateral itself.  credit exposure to banks can  be cut completely, any such  exposures need to be carefully  monitored, hedged and netted  as far as possible with the cash  management side of the bank.  Bail-in under the BRRD has  already been implemented  in the UK. Senior debt held  by issuers as well as corporate  deposits held by banks could  all be bailed-in. For corporates,  this is most acute in swaps  and derivatives if they are  considered to be the liability  of the bank. But if derivatives  are collateralised (for example,  with credit support annexes   in place) they will not be  bailed-in.  Ring-fencing Ring-fencing proposals are  just the start of longer-term  structural change. Uncertainty  over their application in  Europe may lead to a more  fragmented approach, but  the proposals will bring about  a change in the way certain  banks will do business.  Parts of the ring-fenced  entity will be restricted in  terms of the products offered  and may no longer be able  to enter into derivatives and  swaps. Banking relationships  and products may instead be  split between different banks  in the same group, each of  which could have different  ratings. Added to this the fact  that banks may start using  holdco structures, could all  result in more expense for  customers. Ring-fencing could  also affect the availability of  syndicated credit facility back- up lines, which are usually  required by credit rating  agencies for corporate ratings.  In terms of exposure to  ring-fenced banks, corporate  issuers ought to consider  effective netting across  corporate treasury products,  pricing for loans and deposits,  and a trade-off with rating of  the entity they will be dealing  with. The new ring-fenced/ non-ring-fenced structures  will be complicated, and  without specific agreement   Katie Kelly is a director  in the market practice   and regulatory policy   team at ICMA  ICMA works on many areas of regulation that   have an impact on the corporate treasurer  of overburdening corporates,  who use reverse repos to safely  park cash.  ICMA has recently released a  repo market study, Perspectives  from the eye of the storm,  which presents a qualitative  picture of the current state  and future evolution of the  European repo market, from  the perspectives of those who  trade, use and support the  market. It records growing  concern that the cumulative  impact of various prudential  and market regulations, along  with extraordinary monetary  policy, could be affecting the  ability of the European repo  market to function efficiently  and effectively.  Allocations under MiFID II There is currently a MiFID II   Level 2 text proposal that  final allocations made to each  investment client shall be  clearly justified and recorded  by the lead manager.  Currently, issuers are able to  execute a bond issue intraday,  with deal execution involving  allocations to 400-500 investor  accounts within an hour or so.  This requires swift and efficient  allocation processes, which  could be significantly hindered  by the MiFID proposal. The  proposal could also affect  pricing and the number of  allocations made, as well as  increase transaction costs.  Issuers may find that they  inadvertently become more  accountable for allocations,   a function that is currently left  largely to the lead managers.   A summary of ICMA representations on  secondary market liquidity, the Prospectus  Regulation and Pan-European Corporate  Private Placement Market Guide will follow   in a future issue of The Treasurer.    34  The Treasurer April 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Context of treasury  The business context   The prize of new capabilities and know-how, shared overheads  and instant access to new  customers and markets can  be irresistible; down the line,  however, it is a common view  that most M&As do not  deliver anticipated benefits.  There are many  contributory factors to  success and failure, much  beyond the scope of this  article. Fundamentally,  however, the quality of  decision-making depends  significantly on the quality   of information gathered  through discovery and  due diligence. Meaningful  insights into the target s  capability to win competitive  business and contribute to   a new single top line are   often lacking.  While predicting and  managing post-M&A cash  flow, setting up new banking  structures and performing  other tactical and operational  treasurer activities all add  value, as likely the only  member of the M&A team  with corporate financial  responsibilities, treasurers  should also be asking  strategic questions about   how the target feeds its top  line; in doing so, adding  increased value to the   team and enhancing  professional capabilities.  The ability to win  competitive business is   the primary determinant  of growth, profitability and  long-term shareholder value.  A review of the target s sales  pipeline and historical order  intake, however, may actually  provide very little insight.  Pipelines are notoriously  unreliable and history is  IKO  N  IM  A G  ES  often less useful than an  insight into a target s agility  and adaptability. As part   of a more rigorous analysis,  treasurers should be asking  six key questions about how  the target feeds and sustains  its top line:  1. Strategic leadership   or tactical management? High-maturity targets have  an executive, who brings  the voice of the customer to  the boardroom, influencing  corporate vision, mission,  strategy and business planning.   They will be the executive  sponsor for major sales  opportunities and will build  collaborative relationships  with their customer  counterparts and their board  colleagues. They will remove  corporate roadblocks and have  the authority and courage to  disqualify sales opportunities  that are either unwinnable,  unprofitable, or both.  Low-maturity targets  have no such board-level  presence and tend to rely  on middle managers to  tactically manage individual  sales opportunities. They  generally lack the authority to  disqualify sales opportunities  and consequently tend to  allow the development of too  many, lower-quality tenders.  From a treasury perspective,  these behaviours will increase  average cost of sales and will  restrict average contract value.  2. Trusted advisers   or suppliers? Targets that develop excellent  senior customer relationships  and work as trusted advisers  before formal tendering  begins are much better placed  to understand the customer s  business and develop winning  value propositions. Trusted  adviser organisations win  bigger deals and may avoid  private-sector competitive  tendering completely,  reducing cost of sales.  Low-maturity organisations  react to customer  requirements that may  already have been influenced  by a competitor. They are  unable to gather meaningful  business intelligence and  fail to develop meaningful  customer relationships with  executive decision-makers;   TREASURERS HAVE NOT TRADITIONALLY ENGAGED IN THE M&A PROCESS UNTIL JUST BEFORE THE  DEAL IS DONE. PAUL DEIGHTON SAYS THERE IS OPPORTUNITY TO ADD VALUE DURING DISCOVERY  Old tools, new discovery     www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer April 2016 The Treasurer  35  management supported by  fact-based decision-making;  performance is quantitatively  managed and other business  functions contribute to  business winning. Level 5: Optimising;  innovative and  transformational culture;  piloting, refining, and  adopting new approaches   and business models driven  by customer needs.  Targets exhibiting Level 1   behaviours will need  significant attention during  integration planning; Level 2   targets will be reactive and  may struggle to integrate  with the acquirer s approach;  Level 3+ organisations will be  attractive M&A targets from a  business-winning perspective.  Supporting integration  planning and execution As part of the M&A team,  treasurers recognise that  customers need special  attention during the  transition, reassuring them   of continuation of service,  and describing the benefits   to them of the deal (not just  restating the benefits to you).  Earlier planning leads   to better outcomes.  The M&A team should have  the information available  to identify the most mature  business-winning process  from the two parties, which  should be deployed across  the new organisation rather  than trying to conflate two  approaches. Opportunities  will exist for each former  organisation to cross-sell   historical pricing intelligence,  as well as supporting  corporate knowledge  management and learning.  Lower-maturity targets tend  to store information on local  hard drives, with no realistic  possibility of sharing or  learning, destined to repeat  mistakes and incur repeated,  but avoidable costs.  6. Sustainable or a  transient capability? When successful business- winning methods are truly  embedded, they are less likely  to be abandoned at times of  pressure or stress. The target s  ability to sustain performance  is key, particularly when  high-performing sales staff  are often headhunted during  the M&A process. Sustainable  capability leads to sustainable  order intake and predictable  cash flow.   Incisive reporting Although supported by  comprehensive reports, the  overall characterisation of  the target on a 1 to 5 maturity  scale is a critical single  insight. Increasing maturity  levels represent increasing  desirability as an M&A target.  Level 1: Initial; ad- hoc, sometimes chaotic  approaches; success depends  on individual heroic efforts.  Highest cost of sale, lowest  contract values. Level 2: Managed; reactive  approach to customer  requests; basic project  management and quality- control processes in place   and some ability to repeat  earlier successes.  Level 3: Defined; proactive  approach to customer  engagement via a tailored  standard business-winning  process; learning is  shared across the whole  organisation. Leading win  rates and contract values. Level 4: Quantitatively  managed; effective  customer-relationship   they often find themselves  negotiating with customer  middle managers as suppliers.   3. Winning teams   or superheroes? Although improving, it is still  commonplace for business- winning competences to   be undefined or limited   to affable personalities   and the possession of   a good network; however,   in today s global and highly  competitive economies, such  competencies fall far short.   Successful business- winning organisations define  critical business, behavioural  and technical competencies as  a basis for recruitment, career  development and succession  planning (incidentally, as does  the ACT). While charismatic  leadership is always an asset, a  reliance on heroes is a liability.  4. Managed or   ad-hoc processes? People typically don t enter  into business-winning roles  because they like processes,  but while individuals may  indeed win smaller deals,  the type of deals that can  transform an organisation s  balance sheet are invariably  won by multidisciplinary  teams. Winning teams have  winning strategies, executed  through disciplined processes,  balancing both delivery and  opportunity risks.  Lower-maturity targets fail  to harness their full corporate  capabilities. Their ad-hoc and  sometimes chaotic approaches  burn cash and waste resources.  Treasurers, as part of the  M&A team, should be able  to characterise the target as  part of risk management and  integration planning.  5. Knowledge  management or  scattered information? Effective business-winning  targets have a knowledge- management infrastructure  that can provide opportunity,  customer, competitor and   existing services to new  customers; this will need  to be carefully planned and  communicated by customer- relationship managers to  realise order intake and   cash benefits.  Relationship between  maturity levels and KPIs Two key business-winning  key performance indicators  (KPIs) are win rate (tenders  won/tenders submitted)  and capture ratio (value of  tenders won/value of tenders  submitted). While there are  many factors influencing  business-winning success   (not least of which is having   a desirable product or service),  there is evidence (see 1 and  2 below) to suggest, all other  factors being equal, that there  is a positive correlation for  complex sales and the top line.  Level 3+ organisations  engage with the customer  earlier and at a more senior  level, allowing them to access  larger budgets and add more  value; they are attractive M&A  targets when considering top- line performance.

WARUT PROMBOON LOOKS AT HOW THEY MIGHT EASE THE PATH FOR FOREIGN INVESTORS  36  The Treasurer April 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Growing panda  that eats dim sum   Everyone is talking  about panda bonds (or renminbi-denominated  bonds issued by international  issuers), even when investor  confidence in both China s  growth story and the  renminbi s value seem   to be waning, albeit not  unanimously. We, on the  other hand, think panda  bonds are on their way   to becoming international  bonds similar to G3 bonds,  not because of the Chinese  economy, but because the  Chinese regulators will likely  make this happen. However,  many challenges remain. The  first and foremost would be  evolving regulations for the  panda bond market.  It seems unlikely that  the People s Bank of China  (PBOC) will drastically  devalue the renminbi.  Instead, the bank will defend  its currency value using its FX  reserves to buy renminbi or  perhaps adjusting its policies  to stem capital flights. These  flights could be slowed by  expanding the panda bond  market, a move that would   boost onshore liquidity.  Panda bond development  may well come at the expense  of offshore renminbi-bond  markets or so-called dim   sum bonds.   According to Bloomberg,  panda bond issuance has  risen to RMB 21bn (at   the time of writing) from   RMB 2bn at the end of 2014.  And yet the size of the panda  bond market was only 0.04%  of the total onshore renminbi  bonds (also known as Chinese  yuan (CNY) bonds and worth  RMB 47 trillion). The closest  local currency bond market  is the Japanese local currency  bond market, including  Japanese yen (JPY) or samurai  bonds issued outside Japan.   Samurai bonds accounted  for 2.5% of all outstanding  JPY bonds. We plotted local  currency outstanding bonds  in Japan, the eurozone and  China against their respective  M2 money supplies (see table,  opposite) and found that CNY  bonds have a long way to go  before they reach 100% of  China s M2 money supply. We  expect the share held by panda   bonds in total outstanding  CNY bonds to rise towards  2.5% in the near future from  the current 0.04%.  The International Finance  Corporation (IFC) has  predicted that panda bonds  outstanding would exceed  $50bn by 2020. We think  the CNY bond market could  grow in the same way as  the JPY bond market did in  2006. It took Japan four to  five years from 2006 to grow  its domestic bond market  from a third of the size of the  country s M2 money supply  to the 50% mark. Assuming  that outstanding CNY bonds  will account for 50% of  China s M2 money supply  ($21.5 trillion) in China   by 2020 (the same as their  level in 2015, a conservative  estimate) and 2.5% of these  will be the panda bond share  of total outstanding CNY  bonds, so the outstanding  panda bonds could rise to  $268bn by 2020.   RMB 364.3bn and RMB  175.6bn of dim sum bonds  will mature in 2016 and  2017, respectively, according   to Bloomberg. If Chinese  regulators continue to allow  these issuers to use panda  bond proceeds outside China,  declining onshore yields and  rising onshore liquidity will  motivate issuers to sell panda  bonds to refinance their dim  sum bonds. Issuers of dollar  bonds may even consider  selling panda bonds to  diversify their investor bases  and reduce currency risk.   Panda bond development  will also help expand the  CNY bond market and,  unintentionally, cannibalise  the dim sum bond market.  About 95% of CNY bond  investors are Chinese  accounts, and a loss of foreign  investor confidence in the  Chinese economy will not  affect demand for CNY bonds  so much as that for dim  sum bonds (of which most  investors are foreign accounts).  It is true that panda  bonds can be issued by any  entities outside China, as  long as they are approved by  Chinese regulators. For non- Chinese issuers, we expect  panda bonds to be issued by      www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer April 2016 The Treasurer  37  This could mean that US  and Japanese issuers are less  likely than their European  counterparts to issue panda  bonds. Moreover, the existing  rule requires three years  of financial results, with  management discussion  in Chinese for all panda  bond issuers. Translation  or conversion of foreign  accounting standards into  CAS takes time and could  slow down panda bond  development. In short,  exemptions from the  accounting standard are not  clearly explained and this  is an area where the PBOC  could clarify the rules so that  corporate treasurers can plan  their renminbi financing.   4. Foreign dealing will  speed up panda bond  development. Foreign  investors accounted for only  about 2% of outstanding  CNY bonds at the end of 2015,  according to Reuters. The  PBOC announced last July  that sovereign wealth funds,  supranational institutions  and central banks would no  longer need pre-approval to  invest in China s interbank  bond market. In our view,  this will increase demand  for good-quality investment- grade corporate and quasi- sovereign panda bonds due   to limited risk appetite  of these institutions. The  inclusion of renminbi in the  IMF s special drawing rights  means that central banks  will increase renminbi- denominated assets,  including panda bonds.   5. Chinese property  developers have recently  issued private-placement  panda bonds listed on the   reason many issuers are  interested in issuing panda  bonds. Second, the Chinese  government s determination  to expand the panda bond  market will encourage PBOC  to relax this rule.  2. Panda bonds must  be rated by Chinese  credit rating agencies.  International investors and  issuers may not be familiar  with Chinese rating agencies,  and their lack of a relationship  with them may prolong the  underwriting period and  deter international issuers  altogether. However, many  issuers, such as Daimler and  Canada s British Columbia  province, have received  exemptions on the Chinese  credit rating requirement.  3. Panda bond issuers must  adopt Chinese Accounting  Standards (CAS), which  could be difficult for  international issuers and  underwriters to understand.  Daimler has been allowed to  simply explain the difference  in its IFRS-based and CAS- based figures without having  to re-release its financial  statements under CAS. We  understand that PBOC has,   to some extent, acknowledged  the validity of the IFRS, but  has not offered much of an  opinion on Japanese and  US accounting standards.   investment-grade issuers,  specifically sovereigns,  quasi-sovereigns, provincial  governments, and high- quality financial institutions  and corporates. For Chinese  issuers incorporated outside  China, we believe that the  panda bond new issuer list  will be similar to that of  regular CNY and/or dim sum  bonds. In other words, the  panda bonds issued by these  entities will be a mixed bag  of investment- and non- investment-grade credits.  We said the Chinese  regulators will jump-start   the panda bond market.  Now let s look at how the  regulators could amend the  current panda bond rules   to accomplish just that.  1. Panda bond proceeds  usually cannot be taken  outside of China. We  believe that this rule stalled  the growth of the panda  bond market in the past. The  IFC launched the first-ever  panda bonds back in 2005.  Since then, only IFC, Asian  Development Bank and  Daimler have issued, until last  year, when some panda bond  issuers received exemptions  to repatriate proceeds   outside China. We expect   the exemptions to become an  official rule for two reasons.  First, the ability to repatriate  proceeds is perhaps the main   Warut Promboon is chief  rating officer at Dagong  Global Credit Rating Ltd   in Hong Kong  Panda bond proceeds usually cannot  be taken outside of China. We believe  that this rule stalled the growth of the  panda bond market in the past  exchanges instead of issuing  panda bonds in the interbank  market. We understand  that the former merely  requires approval from the  China Securities Regulatory  Commission (CSRC) and  preregistration with an  exchange. Private placements  do not have as many  requirements, such as the  40% maximum debt limit (of  net assets) for additional CNY  bond issuance. In addition,  these private-placement  panda bonds do not require  Chinese credit ratings.   These exchange-traded  panda bonds will be less  liquid than those traded in   an interbank market, which   is far bigger in size. This could  mean that issuers of such  exchange-traded bonds will  pay higher coupons than for  panda bonds listed in the  interbank market. However,  looser supervision and  regulations could mean that  exchange-traded panda bonds  would be much quicker to  issue and, as a result, would  immediately benefit from  existing onshore liquidity.  The speed of panda bond  development depends on  how efficiently the Chinese  regulators move, in our view.  The time for panda bonds is  now and it could not be more  necessary (for the Chinese  regulators) than ever to push  panda bonds to become  a prominent global fixed- income product.

While it is understandable  that companies are pulling   back on significant  investment decisions against  a backdrop of political   and economic uncertainty,   by waiting to invest,  companies risk falling  behind the times, and their  competitors. Technology,   for instance, is changing  at such a rapid pace   and  disrupting entire sectors    that delayed investment   could not only hamper  business productivity, but   are not easy to discern. Some  industry observers believe  that the growth of low-paid  and low-skilled jobs in the  post-crisis period is partly   to blame. But the number   of companies building up  their cash reserves and  cutting back or delaying  strategic investments also  has a role to play. In the 47th  edition of the Lloyds Bank  Business in Britain report,  which surveys 1,500 small to  medium enterprises across  the UK, we found that, while  British businesses continue   to have a relatively upbeat  view on the economy in the  short term, the prospects   severely impact commercial  viability, too.  The investment  compromise  The productivity challenge  is a key economic issue  for the UK, and continued  investment across industries  will be central to ensuring   the UK remains competitive  on the global stage.

The most successful  businesses are likely to be    Despite rising employment, productivity in the UK  has fallen further behind other  leading Western economies  than at any other time since  comparable records began in  1991. According to the latest  figures from the Office for  National Statistics, in 2014,  the UK s productivity was 18%  lower than the average of the  remaining G7 economies.  What s more, the UK s  manufacturing sector was  shown to be an astonishing  45% less productive than that  of the US.

As a senior  secured lending facility, ABL  enables borrowers to leverage  their existing asset base  spanning plant, machinery  and property, as well as  receivables and inventory  to support straightforward  working capital liquidity.   ABL has become an area  of focus for the advisory  and corporate finance  communities as the demand  for more  borrower-friendly   options has increased. Given  their fully asset-secured  nature, ABL solutions allow  for the release of greater  leverage multiples and help  the release of liquidity into   a business.   The right tool for   the right job So, while making investments  doesn t come easily in the  current market environment,  using tools such as asset  finance and ABL can help  treasurers to ensure that  they fund their new assets  effectively and leverage their  existing business assets in the  best way possible. Moreover,  these solutions can offer  businesses greater control  over their liquidity position  and improved diversification  in their funding mix.  In an economic context  plagued by numerous  uncertainties, it is still true  that capital expenditure  cannot be postponed  indefinitely. The productivity  challenge focuses the need to  replace older equipment and  invest in new technologies  that drive competitive  advantage and support  growth into new markets.  Asset finance and ABL carry   Asset finance brings  specific advantages for  financing capital projects.  These structures are designed  for this purpose, and as  they have a specific tangible  asset as collateral, they are  less likely to impact existing  covenants and credit limits.  Different types of lease  or asset finance can be  structured very specifically   to support delivery of a  project   for example, cash  advances can be matched  with project cash flows, which  are released as the underlying  asset gains in value and  begins to generate cash.  A wide range of assets can  be appropriate as funding  collateral, making asset- based financing an attractive  opportunity for many  industries. Manufacturing is  an obvious one, but fundable  assets are widespread and  most UK industries are   able to consider this as an  alternate source of funding.  Most recently, we have  supported clients using this  style of funding to procure  critical technology to improve  key system performance  and data resilience. This is  particularly topical given the  rising threat of cyberattacks  and the media attention that  downtime inevitably draws.  Use of existing assets to  support working capital  The range of sectors that can  use asset finance funding to  secure the purchase of new  equipment highlights how  much value is locked up in  assets already held by UK  businesses. It is estimated  that £2.3 trillion of assets,  held on the balance sheets  of UK businesses, could  potentially be used to fund  further growth.   those that endeavour to do  so in ways that do not inhibit  the business and enable it to  make the investments that  drive longer-term efficiencies.  Well-planned investments  have the potential to reduce  production overheads,   deliver quality enhancements  for customers and drive  overall productivity.   Driving competitive  advantage is not about  cutting short-term costs, but  positioning the company so  that it has a stable cost base  over the long term and can  take advantage of commercial  opportunities as they arise.   The increasingly strategic  role played by treasury teams  recognises the need to find  ways to fund investment in  the company s future and  requires them to consider  the increasingly diverse  range of alternative funding  mechanisms. Some cash   can be unlocked from the  working capital cycle by  improving the efficiency   of the financial supply   chain, but alternate and   more vigorous solutions are  needed to fund meaningful  capital projects.   Alternative funding   for asset acquisition  The use of asset finance  and leasing in the UK has  become more attractive and  popular in recent years, as  evidenced by reports from  bodies including the Finance  & Leasing Association (FLA).  According to a recent FLA  study, asset finance was used  to fund nearly 32% of UK  investment in machinery,  equipment and purchased  software in 2015. This  represents a 15% increase  on the £26bn of funding  advanced in 2014.

The benefits of an  established relationship   with a trusted bank can bring  these capabilities together  and link them on a cross- functional basis with the  business teams to deliver   a whole solution.   ASSET FINANCE AND ASSET- BASED LENDING AT A GLANCE Asset finance  Asset finance or leasing can be an  important complement to traditional  forms of financing, aligning capital  expenditure programmes and investment  to appropriate financing facilities.  Capital projects that involve a wide  variety of asset types, physical and  intangible, are likely to be appropriate  for asset finance.   This can be used to fund the  acquisition of new business-critical  assets enabling productivity gains, the  development of competitive advantage  and, ultimately, growth.  Asset-based lending (ABL)  ABL is a senior secured lending facility  that allows a borrower to leverage not  only their invoices (receivables), but also  their stock (inventory), plant, machinery  and property. Advances are based upon  eligible security with formulas against  each individual asset type.   This can be used for straightforward  working capital liquidity or to provide  more leveraged solutions to support  transactional funding.  The increasingly strategic role played by treasury  teams recognises the need to find ways to fund   investment in the company s future    40  The Treasurer April 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Treasury operations Technology  Going up While this elevation  of treasury has been  happening, there have also  been changes in the way we  choose, use, access, support,  budget and pay for IT   and  our expectations of it.  PC- based applications changed  the life of treasury and  cloud will do the same,” says  Cindy Murray, head of global  treasury product platforms  and digital channels,  Bank of America Merrill  Lynch. The relative ease of  deployment, avoidance of  high upfront hardware and  software costs, plus reduced  IT maintenance costs are  among the potential benefits  already attracting treasurers.  For luxury travel company  Scenic, these were just some  of the things that recently  pulled it in the direction  of a cloud platform for  integrated cash and risk  management (from Reval).   We need to enhance our  reporting capability in   order to ensure that senior  management is provided  with real-time information  upon request,” says Christian  Azzopardi, Scenic treasury  manager. As well as meeting  functional treasury and  management reporting   needs, there was another   big pull factor:  We don t  need to have internal IT  resources to implement it,”  adds Azzopardi.  It is a paradox that, as IT  has become more important  to treasury and other parts  of the business, many in- house IT departments have  become less important. As  digital technologies have been  consumerised, IT has been  democratised and demystified.  So, although treasurers  want access to the latest and  greatest technology resources,  they don t always want or need  an IT department or treasury  technology department  to make decisions about  which technology resources  are best for treasury and   IL LU  ST R  AT IO  N : S  H U  TT ER  ST O  C Kthe position that an ERP   treasury module was the only  possible solution. I had to  push back hard to justify a  treasury management system  [TMS]. They didn t seem to  understand why I wanted  what was best for treasury,  not what was cheapest and  easiest for IT.”   It rarely comes to pistols  at dawn. Historically, Sandra  and the IT crowd have  almost always pulled rank  on Hector and his fellow  treasurers on treasury  technology decisions;  in many organisations,  they still do. But since the  financial crisis, the position  of many treasurers has been  strengthened, enabling  them to exert more influence  over treasury technology  decisions; whether this   means arguing for or   against the treasury   module of an ERP, for   or against a TMS, or  e-banking, trading or   another treasury tool.  A SUCCESSFUL TREASURY FUNCTION DEPENDS ON GOOD DEPLOYMENT OF  TECHNOLOGY. BUT CAN TREASURY S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE IT DEPARTMENT SURVIVE   DEVELOPMENTS SUCH AS CLOUD COMPUTING? LESLEY MEALL INVESTIGATES  FRIENDS OR ENEMIES?   Meet Sandra. She s  an IT specialist and manager with a Big   Four professional services  firm, where she specialises   in treasury transformation  projects   and when it   comes to technology, she s  unashamedly a fan of  enterprise resource planning  (ERP) systems.  If a company  is an SAP customer, my  starting position is to  consider the SAP treasury  module to see if it will work.  It makes sense to leverage   a platform that is already   part of the company s IT  infrastructure, something   it is already invested in,”   she explains.  Meet Hector. He s group  treasury director for a mining  company, where he has spent  the past three years juggling  his day job and a treasury  transformation project   and  when it comes to technology,  he s unashamedly not a  fan of ERP. He says:  IT  came to this project with      www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer April 2016 The Treasurer  41  compliance and regulation,  and they are right there  building that functionality  into the system,” she says.   Analytics is one of the areas  where emerging technologies  may have a radical impact  on what treasurers can  achieve with IT in the future,  because whether this type  of software is embedded in  specialist applications, or  accessed through general- purpose systems, it can be  used to uncover patterns  and potential issues that  might otherwise be missed.  As one group treasurer  explained in a previous issue  of The Treasurer (see www. treasurers.org/node/307758),  by using a predictive analytics  tool to detect patterns in  warranty claim findings,  treasury has reduced the  impact these unplanned  events have on the company s  cash management.  Because data analytics  can provide valuable  insights across a spectrum  of treasury and finance  topics, it is important for  the treasurer (and the CFO)  to ensure that deployments  are not seen purely, or even   bank communication and  reconciliation plus various  other treasury processes for  almost seven years.  Security is another area  where the chief information  officer (CIO), chief  technology officer (CTO) or  chief information security  officer (CISO) and the head  of treasury may differ on  the relative safety of cloud.  Colleemallay does not lie  awake at night worrying  about the safety and security  of the various cloud-based  services that Dassault relies  on.  As long as our service  provider is audited each year  and certified SAS 70, and   we keep monitoring that,   I believe that they are quite  safe,” he says. You are more  likely to find this kind of  independent certification at   a cloud service provider than  in many small enterprises.   Analyse this Perceived lack of IT security  wasn t a barrier for the Lam  Research Corporation either.  When it decided to explore  data analytics to see how it  could improve its investment  reporting, it also opted for  a cloud service provider:  Clearwater.  I see them as an  extension of our team,” says  Tamara Anthony, director of  treasury, at Lam.  Clearwater  is very up to date on   then take responsibility for  the implementation and  maintenance and upgrades.   Going down Because of the reduced need  for their services, it is not  unheard of for in-house IT  departments to discourage  the spread of cloud-based  software and services. Kevin  Salter, IT director of 2020  Innovation Group, recalls  a conversation he had last  year at a company that was  planning a switch from servers  on the premises to servers in  the cloud.  The IT guy was  about to move on and leave  the company, and he admitted  to me,  We should probably  have done this 12 months ago,  but I like my servers ,” says  Salter. The perspectives of  incumbent IT staff may not  always be impartial.   Incumbent IT staff with  a vested interest in keeping  their jobs have been known to  criticise the cumulatively high  costs of the cloud s pay-as-you- go approach. However, John  Colleemallay, director of group  treasury with technology  company Dassault Systèmes,  suggests that these costs can  be offset against the reduced  costs for expensive internal  IT staff   and he should  know. Dassault has been  using a cloud-based solution  for cash management,   Lesley Meall is a freelance  journalist specialising in  technology and finance  Analytics is an area where emerging  technologies may have a radical impact  on what treasurers can achieve with IT  primarily, as IT projects. Neglect  this and it could become a  missed opportunity. However,  treasurers may need to fight  over the next few years to hold  their ground if they want to be  as involved in the selection and  implementation of emerging  analytics systems as they have  been over the past few years in  cloud-based systems for treasury  and risk management.   We will see greater influence  by IT in treasury technology  decisions during 2016,” says Bob  Stark, vice president, strategy,  at Kyriba, a cloud treasury  software specialist.  It s because  organisations are fully embracing  the cloud, but the CIO, CTO,  CISO, etc, are realising that their  treasury teams have been taking  rogue decisions.” Perhaps the big  beasts of treasury or IT will pull  rank; perhaps they will find a way  to balance best practice in IT with  what s best for treasury; perhaps  Sandra and Hector will end up  duelling with pistols at dawn.

A Close tie B Loose tie  If you answered A, close tie,  the strong personal network  that would do anything  for you, you are among the  majority who answered  this question. It s natural to  think that those closest to us  would have our best interests  at heart. After all, friends  don t let friends fail. If you  selected this answer, most  likely you have a strong group  of close friends and family  that you depend on and who  depend on you. However,  when looking for a job, or  for business opportunities,  the broader and looser your  network, the more successful  your search is likely to be.  Our close ties often share our  same networks of contacts    they know who you know.   If you answered B, loose  tie, you may already know  how powerful a wide network  of loose tie contacts can  be. At the least, it gives us  the opportunity to connect  with friends of friends or  acquaintances who, in turn,  can provide a bridge to   other contacts.  But loose tie networks   are more powerful than that.  Since many of these contacts  are less directly tied to you,  they are less concerned   with mitigating risk on   your behalf.  In his landmark work,  The Strength of Weak Ties,  Stanford sociologist Mark  Granovetter studied people  who were searching for jobs   Networks are not the  same as networking.  Networks are the   various groups with whom  we are associated, while  networking implies that   we are using our networks  in a deliberate way to   further our personal   or professional goals.  Your network can be   a powerful resource. The  mantra:  It s not what you  know, but who you know    is all too true when it comes  to getting an interview or  providing critical access  to information. What a  difference it would make if,  instead of focusing only on  the number of contacts in  our networks, we worked  instead at forming a  community of support for  our future. Who wouldn t  want an interconnected  group of people capable   of helping us to land jobs,  find new business, solve   a problem or support us   in times of crisis?  The two networks  everyone has You already have at least  two different types of  networks in your life:  personal and professional.  Personal networks are   www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer April 2016 The Treasurer  45  to find out what role their  social networks played in  landing one. He found that  people who used loose tie  connections had greater  success in job searches,  experienced greater levels   of job satisfaction and made  more money. Since loose  tie contacts are a bit more  removed, they see the world  a little differently and can  evaluate risk with a more  objective view.  Maybe no one in your close  circle of friends and family  has started a company before,  worked in a high-risk venture  or quit a good-paying job. But  in the outer reaches of your  network, someone surely has.  Connecting with them will  help you gain the confidence  to take a little more risk. They  might provide that valuable  insight you need to make  that risk a success or offer  other connections to people  who could be helpful. They  might help you recognise an  entrepreneurial opportunity  or new business avenue.  We all need to have both  personal and professional  networks. Both are  important. Both play a critical  role in our success, happiness  and careers. However, it s  your loose tie network that  offers the best potential when  it comes to helping you access  new opportunities.   This is an edited extract from  Stretch: How to Future-Proof  Yourself for Tomorrow s  Workplace, by Karie Willyerd  and Barbara Mistick (Wiley,  February 2016)  Karie Willyerd is   a workplace futurist   for SAP company  SuccessFactors  Barbara Mistick is  president of Wilson  College, Pennsylvania,  and an entrepreneur  populated with family and  friends, people you see often  and people who care for  you deeply. You might think  of those in your personal  network as the people you  know who would be willing  to go the extra mile for you.  You could call them at 3am  and they would answer the  phone. The relationships  used primarily for support  and friendship make up your  personal network.  Many networks that  are primarily personal are  characterised by close ties.  Close or strong ties are  usually defined as family  and friendship relationships,  and are likely to include your  spouse, life partner, close  family members and perhaps  even distant relatives that  you might see frequently.  Other strong ties include  friendships, primarily those  that are non-work-related,   but could include your   closest work friends, friends  from school or your place   of worship. All together,   these groups make up the  close tie component of your  personal network.  Most people also have a  number of  loose tie  or  weak  tie  networks. Perhaps you  are a member of an alumni  association from the college  or university you attended.  Maybe you have a group of  acquaintances or friends  who have moved away, but  with whom you still keep in  touch regularly via holiday  messages or occasional  Facebook comments. Or  you might have an even  looser group of people you  used to work with or have  only met at conferences and  are in your address book or  online social network. (Non- reciprocal relationships don t  count here; following your  favourite actor or comedian s  Twitter feed isn t going to be  helpful to you in this regard.)  These looser collections of  networks   especially the  ones including business   SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K    Behavioural skills Self management and accountability  Using your loaf Before the discovery of the bystander  effect, a similar effect was observed in  the workplace. What was discovered is  a phenomenon commonly referred to as   social loafing . This is where a group of  individuals working on a task together  will personally contribute less effort  than if they were working on their own.   If you witnessed an accident, what  would you do? Would you rush   over to help, administer first aid    to casualties and call the emergency  services? Or would you stand by and  watch, waiting for someone else to get  involved? However much you d like   to think you d be the hero, research  suggests that you re more likely to   do the latter. But why is this?  Leave it to someone else… This behaviour is called the bystander  effect or bystander apathy. It occurs   in particular when we re afraid of    losing face  in front of strangers. In   this situation, it s because we might  assume that there are other people  better qualified to get involved  than we are or that our actions  might be ineffective or, worse still,  counterproductive. In other words,   it s a fear of failure.  It sounds like an irrational fear,  particularly when the consequences of  our not getting involved could be that  someone in trouble doesn t get the help  they need, but it s been observed in  many psychological experiments and   in real-life emergency situations.  This is a subtle effect, first shown in a  simple rope-pulling exercise, in which  individuals exerted less energy pulling  the rope as part of a group than they did  as an individual.   Often, the most common reason   for loafing is feeling that any effort will  not be utilised or recognised, so a sense  of personal responsibility can be critical   to our overall effectiveness in work.  The benefits of being   a responsible person Being more responsible doesn t just  mean that you re a better person   to have around in the event of an  emergency. When you re willing to   take responsibility, you become a   more productive and efficient person.   In the workplace, your efforts to   become more responsible are sure to   get noticed and are likely to help you  climb the career ladder, because you  won t just be doing the minimum  required to pull your weight   you ll   be owning tasks and showing that  you re someone who s got what it   takes to lead others.   Outside work, other people will start  to realise that you re someone they can   DON T BE A  BYSTANDER  OVERCOMING INERTIA AND THE FEAR OF FAILURE IS ALWAYS HARD  WORK. STUART DUFF LOOKS AT SOME OF THE BARRIERS TO TAKING   RESPONSIBILITY AT WORK, AND SUGGESTS SOME REMEDIES    Before you can start to behave more responsibly,  you need to understand what s holding you back  and the steps to take to overcome these blockages  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer April 2016 The Treasurer  47  Stuart Duff is head   of development   at Pearn Kandola   business psychologists  What else might be stopping you? Tying in with the accident scenario, we  may be held back by an assumption that  we don t have the relevant expertise and  that someone else does, for example,  a doctor or police officer. We therefore  convince ourselves that our intervention  is unnecessary or even unwanted.   Another common excuse for not  stepping up to the mark in the workplace  is a lack of time. We frequently perceive  ourselves to be too busy to take  responsibility for a task, although closer  inspection may prove that spending too  much time being unproductive may   in fact be to blame. There is always too  much to do if we don t focus on the most  immediate tasks first. In other words, if  you want to be more effective, prioritise!   Alternatively, we might actually  be willing to take responsibility in a  situation, but we re just not sure how   to convince other people that we are.   Why should I bother? We may also  avoid taking responsibility for a task  because we re simply not interested in  it. If that s the case, here are four simple  actions that can help you deal with this  mental barrier:  1. Understand what motivates  you. Do you know what motivates  your colleagues and how this might  relate to the current situation? We  are all motivated by different things    the opportunity to learn frequently  motivates people more than money,  so looking at what you may achieve  personally through your involvement  may spur you into action. 2. Appreciate the bigger picture. The  task you or others have been avoiding  might seem mundane or unrewarding,  but it could have a far-reaching overall  impact. Recognising how a single issue  or task dovetails into a  bigger picture   can often reignite flagging interest. 3. Utilise the power of the  psychological contract. The  psychological contract is the implicit  understanding and trust between  people engaged in fulfilling objectives  or tasks together, or between those   who give instructions and others who  carry them out. Unlike a legal contract,  it s unwritten and usually unspoken,  yet understood and expected by those  involved. It accounts for the kind of  things we all do (or don t do) in the  workplace and elsewhere, which aren t  detailed in job descriptions, but to which  we psychologically contract as members  of a larger group or organisation. For  example, checking the office building  is secure when you re last to leave is  something you might do, even though  you re not the caretaker; it s a pain to do  and you re already late… 4. Set a great example. If they don t,  why should I? An organisation s ethos   or culture is determined less by its  policies and procedures than by the  behaviour of its employees. It only takes  the example of a single individual to  influence many others.  Draw up an action plan The last step in taking responsibility is  to act. If this prospect still daunts you,  research suggests that planning how you  will achieve your goal will make it much  more likely that you will do so in reality.   In creating a plan of action, consider  the points covered above and decide what  is most relevant to you. Now, identify how  you might apply your plan to a specific  situation and consider, not only about  what you could do, but also what might  deter you. By identifying any potential  problems in advance, you have the  opportunity to think of suitable solutions  to deal with them or, if necessary, to  develop alternative courses of action.   Finally, don t forget to enlist the  support of others. Knowing you have  access to advice will give you confidence  and increase your personal and  professional effectiveness.   rely on, bringing new opportunities to  enrich your life. But before you can start  to behave more responsibly, you need  to understand what s currently holding  you back and the steps you can take to  overcome these blockages.  What stops us taking responsibility?   We ve already seen some of the reasons  for not taking responsibility in the  accident scenario described above,   and that fear of failure can be one   of the biggest considerations that   holds us back. We are conditioned   from an early age to seek approval from  other people. This means that, unless  we re sure that we ll be successful,  we avoid doing things that could risk  drawing criticism.   Conquering the fear of failure So what do we need to do to overcome  this barrier? • Identify what it is that you re afraid   of. By defining it, you re making a start  on challenging it.  • Evaluate. Review the fears you ve  written down and assess whether  they re rational concerns. What s the  worst that could happen if your fear  were to be realised? At this point   you can also exercise some methods  for keeping your fears in check:   writing them down, focusing on   the present moment and thinking  about the successful moments in   your life that you needlessly worried  about beforehand.  • Reinterpret your fears. Peel   back the layers of the fear to find   out what s at the bottom of it,   and where they originate. For   example, are you only afraid because  of something that happened to  someone else?  • Do something about it. Doing  nothing is often counterproductive,  because the longer you do nothing,   the more your fears take root and grow.  Talk to other people, who may help   to put your fears into perspective, and  focus on the positive outcomes from  each of your decisions, no matter how  small. Gain confidence from thinking  about what you ll learn, and from  developing different ways of achieving  what you want to achieve   these are  your back-up plans, and they make  failure less likely.    Business skills Qualifications  48  The Treasurer April 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer   Treasurers need to manage portfolios of borrowings and investments, and evaluate the potential benefits of changing the mix. Deals we need to assess include: (1) Borrowing  (2) Selling investments  (3) Blends of both  Why borrow We might consider borrowing to take advantage of an early- settlement discount. If the value of the discount is more than our  cost of borrowing, this will give a net saving.   Let s explore an example, based on a recent assessment question.1  Discount offer Your company is due to pay a supplier s invoice for £3m in 90 days   time. You have been offered a flat discount of 0.50% to pay 90 days   in advance, today. You do not have enough funds available to make  this payment today. However, you do have sufficient available credit  lines at Libor plus 40 basis points per annum.  Current £ market rate: 90-day Libor 0.60% per annum.  Calculate which of the following choices is the least expensive:  (i) Decline the discount and settle the invoice in 90 days  time. (ii) Accept the discount, funded by borrowing.  Start simple It s usually best to look at the simplest choice first. This provides  a sound base for comparing more complex alternatives. Here, our  simplest choice is to decline the discount, and pay the invoice in full  in 90 days  time. Our future cash outflow will be the full £3m.  Discount saving Alternatively, we can accept the discount of 0.50% (0.005), for paying  early. This discount is  flat , which means the time period is ignored  in the calculation. The discount is: 0.005 x 3,000,000 = £15,000  The discounted invoice amount, payable today, is:   3,000,000   15,000 = £2,985,000  This is the amount we need to borrow for 90 days.  Count the cost The market Libor rate is 0.60% per annum, but we have to pay Libor  plus 40 basis points (0.40%). Our corporate borrowing cost is: 0.60%  + 0.40% = 1% per annum.  Ninety-day £ Libor is quoted as a simple rate, on an ACT/365 fixed  basis. This means borrowing for 90 days will cost 1% x 90 / 365.  The interest charge on borrowing £2,985,000 will be:   2,985,000 x 0.01 x 90 / 365 = £7,360  Is that better? After 90 days, we repay:   2,985,000 + 7,360 = £2,992,360  IN THE  BLEND OPTIMAL CASH MANAGEMENT OFTEN   NEEDS A BLEND OF INGREDIENTS. DOUG  WILLIAMSON SHOWS HOW TO CLARIFY   THE CHOICES AND IMPROVE RESULTS  £ % += CD  000    This is less than the full £3m. Our net saving  is the discount, offset by the interest cost of  funding early settlement:  15,000   7,360 = £7,640  We enjoy a net saving, because the annual equivalent  value of the discount exceeds our annual equivalent cost   of borrowing.  Another ingredient Another cash management choice we might consider is to reduce  our borrowings by selling certain investments. If the interest savings  exceed the investment income given up, we enjoy another net saving.  Let s extend our earlier example to add this ingredient to the mix.  Sell investment, cut borrowings  We have already identified an opportunity to generate net savings  of approximately £7,640 for our company, by borrowing £2,985,000  for 90 days at a rate of 1% per annum.  We also hold a one-year certificate of deposit (CD) investment,  face value £2m, paying 1.25% interest per annum, with 90 days left  to maturity.  Current £ market rate:  90-day CD of a similar credit quality: 0.50% per annum.  Calculate the potential cash flow improvement from selling   the CD to reduce the amount of the borrowing.   Start simpler To calculate the potential benefit, we need to compare our choices.  Again, we start with the simpler one. This is to hold the CD to   its maturity.   The CD repays its face value of £2m at maturity, plus total interest  of 1.25%. Our cash inflow from the CD on day 90 will be:  2,000,000 x 1.0125 = £2,025,000  We d also need to repay the borrowing of £2,985,000, plus   the interest of £7,360 we calculated earlier, a total payment   of £2,992,360.  Time for a table Often, the best way to keep everything clear is to use a table. Our  choices can be column headings. We ll compare (1) borrowing all of the  funds, with (2) selling the CD and borrowing a smaller net amount.  (£000) (1)  Borrow all (2)  Sell CD  Repay borrowing (2,992) ?  CD proceeds 2,025    Net cash outflow  (967) ?  If we sell our CD now, we reduce our borrowing needs, in exchange  for giving up the CD proceeds at maturity. We ve already got several   useful figures, a structure and two question  marks at this stage.  It looks sensible In a table, the ingredients and results start looking   manageable and sensible. We owe £3m, offset by an  asset of about £2m, so our net cash outflow is going to be   around £1m in each case.  Selling the CD The relevant 90-day CD yield is 0.50% (0.005). The sale price today,  discounting the maturity value of £2,025,000, is:  2,025,000 / (1 + (0.005 x 90 / 365) ) = £2,022,506  These proceeds part-fund the discounted invoice amount   of £2,985,000, so now we only need to borrow 2,985,000     2,022,506 = £962,494.  Our interest cost falls to:   962,494 x 0.01 x 90 / 365 = £2,373  Our net cash outflow at day 90 is now simply the repayment   of this smaller borrowing, plus the interest:  962,494 + 2,373 = £964,867  All done Completing our table, we see that choice 2 is the least expensive,   a combination of borrowing and selling the CD.  (£000) (1)  Borrow all (2)  Sell CD  Repay borrowing (2,992) (965)  CD proceeds 2,025    Net cash outflow  (967) (965)  It still makes sense We re best off in this last case, because we save interest at a rate of  1% per annum. This  cost of carry  saving is greater than the 0.50%  per annum investment return that we give up.  The blend was best In this particular scenario, the blended solution had the lowest cash  cost. It won t always, of course. That s why we need to know how to  evaluate our choices with confidence.

The London Stock  Exchange announced recently  that it is considering a merger  of  equals  with its larger  rival, Deutsche Börse. If that  happens, then I, for one, will  lament its passing: I began   my working life in 1982 as   a trainee stockbroker…   As part of my training,  I spent a month as a  blue  button  on the stock exchange  floor. Blue buttons were  unauthorised clerks, so   called because they wore a  button that was blue. The job  of a blue button was to run  around to the various stock   jobbers, who stood by their  hexagonal pitches, and ask  them for the latest prices   on whatever shares the office   upstairs  wanted to enquire  about. It was all terribly  inefficient. It was also quite   a lot of fun.   Obviously, there were   no mobile phones; we used  walkie-talkies to talk to the  office. British Telecom was  still state-owned. ICI and GEC  were the country s leading   50  The Treasurer April 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  onto the floor at 3.30pm to  announce a new  tap stock .  Tradition, dear boy, tradition.  Brokers made their money  by charging their clients a  commission based on the  value of the trade. The rate  of commission was a rigid,  City-wide sliding scale. There  was no price competition    brokers were expected to  compete on  service  (for  which read lunch, rugby  tickets, Henley) and the worth  of their share tips.   It was the days when a  fund manager would call his  broker at around 4pm with  an order to deal in 20,000  shares in some stock or other.    Sorry, did you say buy or sell  20,000?” asked a broker once.   Whichever s easier,” came  the reply. The purpose was  simply to give the broker a  trade on which to earn a crust  as a  thank you  for that day s  lunch at The Long Room.  Few pensioners knew that  that s how their investments  were managed. Few finance  directors or treasurers knew  that these were the sorts of  market transactions that    IN THIS  ISSUE:  MONTH END  companies. We didn t even  have the FTSE 100 index.  Instead, we had the FT 30    which was a geometric average  of the share prices of 30 large  companies, dating back to  1935. It was calculated every  hour. (Well, why would you  want an index updated every  second?) Goodness knows  why, but it s still published.  The stock exchange  floor was little more than  a ridiculous old-fashioned  men s club. Women were  allowed to enter the stock  exchange in 1973, but by the  time I first walked through  the doors at Throgmorton  Street nine years later, very   few women had chosen to join  the ranks.   Practical jokes and rude  ones were common, though  the whiff of  health and safety   had put an end to the practice  of setting fire to a jobber s  newspaper as he stood  reading the Financial Times.

For the purposes of this  leadership race, Stephen Crabb, Liam Fox and Michael Gove have become yesterday s men.   Meanwhile, prominent figures from all political parties in the UK, and both sides of the debate  around Brexit, have proved only too eager to flee the stage. The Parliamentary Labour Party lost  more than 20 members of the shadow cabinet in a week, while prominent Leave campaigners Boris  Johnson and Nigel Farage both made waves with their shock withdrawals   the former from the  Tory party leadership race and the latter as leader of UKIP.   If only businesses and corporate treasurers were in a position to leave the podium and put  decision-making on hold over the summer recess. But plans, responses and  what ifs  need to be  addressed. Boards will need their treasurers  perspective more than ever. The ability to plan and  provide an assessment on internal and external resources needed to weather the uncertainty in the  short and medium term will be of primary importance, as will communicating the level of exposure  implied in different courses of action, as Sarah Boyce, the ACT s policy and technical team s  associate director, describes on page 19.  Happily, executive boards are paying more and more attention to the positions and opinions that  treasurers can deliver, as Sally Percy finds in her feature on page 24. Treasurers  perspectives on  business strategy and risk management are now a key feature in boardroom discussions. And with  so little in the way of firm ground on the political and economic fronts, we should expect treasurers   assessments of current volatility to be much sought after.  In or out of the EU, corporates need a secure understanding of privacy and data-protection laws  and how they differ from one territory to the next. Detlev Gabel and Tim Hickman set the scene  on legal requirements, on page 34. And on page 32, we look at how Chinese regulators and other  market players can help open up the Panda bond market.

Since the UK referendum vote to  leave the EU, doubts as to the UK s  continued entitlement to export  and import financial services under  the so-called passporting rules have  been much debated in the business  press and by politicians.  Passporting enables authorised  firms operating in the European  Economic Area (EEA) to market  financial services across borders  and is being seen as the aspect of  Brexit with greatest potential to   disrupt UK- and foreign- owned multinationals,  and their ability to  operate from within the UK.   With political parties in  considerable disarray at the   time The Treasurer went to   press, clarity over a firm UK  negotiating stance in relation   to financial services passporting  was lacking. For treasurers,  many of whom make use of  services from banks based on  the continent or with centralised  treasury operations outside the UK,  but within the EEA, that poses a  significant obstacle to the task of  drawing up contingency plans.   Some treasuries are concerned  about the impact Brexit could have   on their teams, as many  are made up of highly  qualified workers from  the EU. Uncertainty  around the future of   what will happen to   EU workers already in the   UK could unsettle teams and  could impact on recruitment  decisions,” said one treasurer.  From a corporate treasury   perspective, in terms of  resources, I could see some cases  where, if you have a treasury centre  on the continent with a number  of UK expats working in it, it may  not be practical for those people  to continue in those roles,” said  Hugh Davies, director at Zanders  Treasury and Finance Solutions.  BRIEFING  06  The Treasurer July/August 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  { BREXIT }  TREASURERS ACT WITH CAUTION  IN THE WAKE OF BREXIT  Members voting in an ACT   poll conducted one week after   the referendum have named FX  volatility and currency weakness as  their primary concern in the wake  of the UK s vote to leave the EU.   Some treasurers reported  avoiding FX trading as far as  possible, in the days following the  Brexit result. However, of those  corporates who have had to carry  out trades, the picture has been  not as restrictive as expected. One  treasurer said:  Although it has  certainly been more challenging in  that some banks have found it easier  to price than others, it has not been  impossible, by any means.”  In a separate ACT poll conducted  one week before the vote, 26%   of respondents said they had  extended their FX hedging, either  by increasing the percentage  hedged or covering further forward.  However, with sterling moving  around 10% lower against most  major currencies, businesses with  balance-sheet hedges can expect  correspondingly large moves in  their mark-to-market values with  potentially adverse impacts on  liquidity.  My suspicion is that some  corporates are facing large margin  calls. If you ve a synthetic dollar  liability for instance, then a 10%  move might mean a considerable   collateral liability and a tense  conversation with your bank,”   said another treasurer.  The prospect of interest-  rate cuts, signalled by Bank   of England governor Mark Carney  in a speech on 30 June, raises   issues for corporates holding  abundant surplus cash, notably  the need to build a plan for a world  where short-term deposits earn very  low or no positive return. It also  presents challenges for treasurers  with pension management  responsibilities. As one treasurer  said:  The biggest immediate  impact comes when you calculate  the pension deficit.”   In my view,   and I am not  prejudging the  views of the other  independent  Monetary Policy  Committee  members, the  economic outlook  has deteriorated  and some  monetary policy  easing will likely  be required over  the summer.” Mark Carney s (pictured above)  forward guidance a week after  Britain voted to leave the EU. SOURCE: THE GUARDIAN, 30 JUNE 2016     There needs to be  a really clear new  framework for how  business engages  with government.  We re a long  way off having  a plan and real  leadership. This  is what business  really needs.” Carolyn Fairbairn, director- general of the Confederation  of British Industry, seeks firmer  ground on the government s  way ahead for corporates,  following the UK s vote to   leave the EU. SOURCE: THE FINANCIAL TIMES, 29 JUNE 2016   WORDS  SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K     { CONTEXT OF TREASURY }  M&A deals fall in UK while value increases, ONS finds The UK s Office for National Statistics  (ONS) has found a sharp increase in   the value of domestic M&A transactions  during Q1 2016, compared with the  previous quarter.  The total value of domestic M&A deals  for Q1 this year was £11.6bn, the highest  value reported since Q4 2008, which saw  totals of £18.2bn. During Q1, dealmakers  brought 57 domestic M&A deals to a  completion, while 29 foreign acquisitions  of UK companies were concluded, down  from 49 in Q4 2015.  The aggregate values for both types   of deal increased significantly. The   total value of domestic M&A for Q1   was £11.6bn, the highest aggregate   value since 2008. Inward M&A for Q1  reached £49.4bn, up from £9.2bn in    Q4 of last year and the highest level since  Q2 2007.  Despite volatility from one quarter  to the next, the total number of deals  involving UK companies remains at  historically low levels.  More broadly, CFO respondents  to the EY Global Capital Confidence  Barometer 2016, say they expect the  global M&A market to improve over the  next 12 months. Some 54% of CFOs from  developed markets expect to actively  pursue acquisitions over the course of  the next year, versus 39% of emerging- market CFOs, according to the study.  The survey also found that 39% of  developed-market CFOs are looking to  hire new talent, compared with 21% of  emerging-market CFOs.  { NEWS FROM THE ACT }  Resources from the ACT The ACT has posted Brexit- related material online and will  be making further information,  guidance and advice on the  implications of the vote to    leave the EU available via   the ACT website at www. treasurers.org/brexit  The ACT is expanding  its means of engaging with   members by establishing   a number of special interest  groups   small groups of  members with common  interests in topics such as cash  management.

According  to reports, Renzi has sought  agreement for a €40bn plan  that would allow Italy to inject  capital into a banking sector  weighed down by around  €200bn in delinquent debts  and bring about the kind of  recapitalisation that other  European countries undertook  in the wake of the 2008  financial crisis.   But the move runs counter to  the trend post-2008 away from  taxpayer-funded bailouts in  favour of creditor-funded bail- ins and would require a waiver  of the EU s Bank Resolution  and Recovery Directive. London and Frankfurt   merger doubts In further fallout following  the Brexit vote, the head of   Germany s financial regulator  cast doubt on whether London  could host the headquarters  of a merged London Stock  Exchange and Deutsche Boerse.  Felix Hufeld said it was   hard to imagine how the  biggest exchange venue in   the eurozone could be steered  from outside the EU or   provide a base for its euro- based clearing business.    He went on to suggest  that euro clearing could  be processed in Frankfurt.  At the time of writing, the  management teams of both  exchanges believed the merger  itself would still go ahead even  with the UK outside the EU. Central bankers put heads  together over Brexit The heads of the UK and US  central banks, Mark Carney   and Janet Yellen, excused  themselves from the European  Central Bank s annual  economics conference to  confer in the wake of the   UK referendum result.  Following the success   of the  Leave  voters and   a sell-off across international  financial markets, Carney  cancelled his ticket to the  Lisbon event in favour of  staying in the UK and Yellen  returned to the US. In the  aftermath of the referendum,  which included sharp falls in  sterling, sell-offs in bank stocks  and downgrading in the UK s   rating from the three main  agencies, Carney faced  criticism about his pro-  Remain stance from   prominent campaigners.  The Bank of England said in  a statement that both the bank  and its governor were focused  on shoring up financial and  price stability.  INTERNATIONAL BRIEFING  { CONTEXT OF TREASURY }  IMF says China must tackle its corporate debt The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has  warned that China s need to tackle its levels   of corporate debt is now pressing, if it is to  avoid deepening economic problems.  In a speech last month in Shenzhen, first  deputy director David Lipton said the country s  ongoing problems with non-performing loans  (NPLs) puts it at odds with the IMF s recent  decision to include the renminbi in its basket   of reserve currencies.  While acknowledging China s moderate  success in moving from an investment phase  towards an economy based on consumption,  Lipton criticised the government s more limited  progress on corporate debt.  Lipton pointed out that total debt in China  is equal to about 225% of GDP. Of that,  government debt represents about 40%, while  households account for a similar proportion.   By international standards, he said, neither   of those burdens are particularly high.  However, corporate debt is a different issue.  China s approximate level of corporate debt   stands at around 145% of GDP, which Lipton  described as  very high by any measure”.  By IMF calculations, Lipton noted, state- owned enterprises (SOEs) account for about  55% of corporate debt   far greater than their  22% share of economic output.   [SOEs] are also far less profitable than  private enterprises,” he said.  In a setting of  slower economic growth, the combination of  declining earnings and rising indebtedness is  undermining the ability of companies to pay  suppliers or service their debts.”  He added:  The past year s credit boom is  just extending the problem. Already, many  SOEs are essentially on life support. [Our]  most recent Global Financial Stability Report  estimated that the potential losses for Chinese  banks  corporate loan portfolios could be equal  to about 7% of GDP.   This is a conservative estimate based on  certain assumptions about bad-loan recoveries  and excluding potential problem exposures in  the  shadow banking  sector.”  { OLIVER WYMAN S WOMEN IN  FINANCIAL SERVICES 2016 RESULTS }  20%   level of female  representation on the  boards of financial  services companies  16%   female  representation at executive  committee level in financial services  32 years   the time it will  take at current rates of growth for  female representation on executive  committees to reach 30%  33%   executive committee  members in financial services   in Norway who are women  20-30% higher   the  attrition rate among female managers,  senior managers and executives  compared with peers in other sectors  THE STATS  PH O  TO  B  Y  36  0 B  /S H  U TT  ER ST  O C  K  Italian prime minister,  Matteo Renzi    www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer July/August 2016 The Treasurer  09  { CONTEXT OF TREASURY }  SME FUNDING   IN EUROPE  If Europe is serious about  supporting jobs and   growth, it requires deeper  capital markets capable of  funding smaller businesses.  That is the message from  the former EU financial  services commissioner  Lord Hill in new London  Stock Exchange report  1,000 Companies to Inspire  Europe 2016. Focusing on  the SME landscape, the  report examines firms that  have collectively reached an  average annual compound  growth rate of 71%, while  increasing their staff by 66%  over the past two years.   The report notes that the  top 100 companies on its list  have grown by more than  400% over the past three  years   yet in four decades,  just one of the world s most  successful start-ups has  come from Europe, while  25% of them have emerged  from California alone. In  the report s view, European  start-ups are saddled with the   short-term fix” of debt, while  equity offers greater space for  development and innovation.  For Hill, work towards capital  markets union is only the  beginning of what Europe  could do for its SMEs.  Lord Hill, who resigned   his EU post in the wake of  Brexit, wrote in the report:    if promising companies  can t get financing in Europe,  they will vote with their feet  and look for it elsewhere”,  benefiting other regions.  Rio s financial black hole  Brazil s financial woes have led the  state of Rio de Janeiro to declare that  it is on the brink of  public calamity , a  statement intended to trigger central  government aid. Acting governor  Francisco Dornelles said the state s  financial woes will affect its ability  to support the Olympic Games  in August. The money shortages  stem from a decline in tax revenues  brought about by falling royalties  from oil and recession in Brazil. India to announce successor   at central bank Two former deputy governors  at India s central bank are the  frontrunners for the top role due   to be announced this month.  Prime minister Narendra Modi   is expected to appoint a successor   to Raghuram Rajan later this   month. Rajan s surprise departure  came in June, when he announced   he was not seeking a second term  and would return to his academic  career. The two main contenders   are Subir Gokarn and Rakesh   Mohan, according to a central   bank official.  German court rules on   bond schemes Germany s highest court has   rejected a case against a landmark   bond-buying programme, declaring  it to be constitutional.  The Constitutional Court in  Karlsruhe rejected a challenge to  the European Central Bank s (ECB s)  emergency bond-buying scheme  that asserted the Outright Monetary  Transactions (OMTs) were effectively  state aid. OMTs were conceived   by the ECB to shore up the euro   and give the bank broad powers   to buy the debt of financially   strained members.   The court has endorsed the   OMTs, which have yet to be   used, but has placed some limits   on Germany s participation in   the scheme.  Abu Dhabi banks to merge National Bank of Abu Dhabi (NBAD)  and First Gulf Bank confirmed that  they are discussing a potential  merger to create one of the largest  banks in the Middle East and Africa.  More consolidation within the  region s banks could follow. The  UAE banking sector has more than  50 banks and has been hit by lower  government spending and falling oil  prices, which have taken their toll   on deposits.  NBAD shares rose 15% on the  day of the announcement and other  banking stocks also saw increases.  Local investors welcomed the news,  but analyst response was muted.  MAKING  THE   NEWS  Rio de Janeiro, Brazil  { CONTEXT OF TREASURY }  Industry bodies say Basel risk rules will hinder corporates Basel Committee plans to alter banks  internal  risk frameworks could backfire and restrict   financial services available to corporate clients.  That s according to the International Swaps and   Derivatives Association (ISDA), which has drawn  up a joint response to the proposed measures with  three other, heavyweight industry groups: the  Global Financial Markets Association (GFMA),  the International Association of Credit Portfolio  Managers (IACPM) and the Japan Financial  Markets Council (JFMC).   Outlined in a March consultation document,   the Basel Committee s changes would strip banks of  the option to use internal risk-based (IRB) methods  for calculating capital requirements for credit-risk  exposures. In particular, the committee aims to  rein in variability in risk-weighted assets (RWAs).  However, in their response, the groups argue that  a host of key, corporate lifelines   from project  finance deals to aircraft, shipping and commodities  finance   would be drastically affected.   The committee s March consultation paper  outlined proposals to remove the option that    banks currently have to use IRB approaches  for certain risk exposures, in cases where the  parameters cannot be estimated with sufficient  reliability for regulatory capital purposes; enforce  exposure-level, model-parameter floors, to ensure  minimum levels of conservatism for portfolios  where IRB approaches remain available, and reduce  variability in RWA; also for portfolios where the   IRB approaches remain available.  A joint response from ISDA, IACPM and JFMC  criticises the objectives, arguing the measures  represent a  major step backwards”.   The removal of risk sensitivity,” explained the  response,  will distort capital allocation decisions,  origination incentives and pricing to the detriment  of banks  customers and the global economy.”  In particular, it warned:  Corporates are likely  to suffer restrictions on the availability of many  banking services and products needed to support  their commercial activities and hedge financial  risks. Corporate lending, capital markets activity,  project finance deals, aircraft and shipping finance…  will all be extremely affected by the proposals.”  Lord Hill  PH O  TO : B  LO O  M B  ER G  /G ET  TY  IM  A G  ES    TECHNICAL BRIEFING  10  The Treasurer July/August 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  As you will be aware, following the UK referendum, Brexit is a reality.  There is much uncertainty and therefore highly volatile market   conditions. The ACT will be taking the lead to ensure that regulators  and policymakers understand the real economy requirements to ensure   that growth can be delivered post Brexit. Also, as part of our remit is  to provide informed and unbiased technical advice, we have provided   a range of resources that can be accessed at www.treasurers.org   The first four decades of  my career in finance were   those when cash was king.  Now substantially into my  fifth decade, cash is a  depreciating asset with yields  sub-inflation as central  bankers try to cajole us into  spending: new cars; perhaps  an entrepreneurial outburst;  or an eye-wateringly  expensive apartment.  The attack is multi- pronged. Negative rates  have seeped out from the  safe haven of Switzerland  to the short end of the euro  corporate bond market. We  are in the extreme world,  where processes and systems  honed over the postwar  decades may prove unable to  cope. In some jurisdictions,  interest legally can only go  one way. Short-term debt  is already being issued at  a premium to par so that a  positive coupon can be set.  Negative rates come with  other problems. That bank  loan you swapped into fixed  rate no longer looks so  straightforward because the  Loan Market Association- documented bank loan has an  interest floor you agreed when  rates were always positive,  while the International Swaps  and Derivatives Association- documented swap does not.  Banks struggle to take your  deposits in a world where they  dare not hold spare capital,   outbreak of cooperation  among governments  worldwide amid a rush to  reduce corporate tax rates.  And why? Classic Western economic  policy dictates one can  spend out of deflation into  growth. The regulators of  our old Western economies  want you to get the cash into  circulation: pay dividends,  make share buybacks, lower  prices, raise wages, fund the  pension deficit, pay tax, pay  down debt, invest.   The first two enable others  to invest if they are any better  than you at finding anything  in which to invest. The next  two may be anathema to your  directors, who have survived  several recessions and cling to  any price and cost advantage  they can. The next a  perhaps   as we watch two old British  businesses collapse under  the burden of pension costs  created by low yields. UK  members will be asked to  comment on our response   to the Base Erosion and Profit  Shifting initiative to get you  to pay more tax. The next  one would enable your bank  to become even smaller or  moves the problem onto your  institutional debt investor.  The last, well, you would have  done that already if you could  find anything worthwhile to  invest in.  We do ask treasurers why  they hold cash. Numerous  clever minds at the Bank of  England (http://tinyurl.com/ jnono6s) have asked the same  question. The reasons are  manifold: continued mistrust  of banks to be able to lend  at the very crisis point at  which you need to borrow;  that potential acquisition  you are always on the verge  of funding; President Trump;  French election; Chinese  collapse; continued low  growth; excess steel; Zika  virus; and so on.   You could try repos to  squeeze a better yield than  deposits, but inflation still  wipes out the yield. You might  glance longingly at riskier  banks and traded securities,  but that approach tends to  catch up with reality. We have  to accept at least that even a  small company takeover will  not be agreed in a couple of  weeks, and put the cash out  long enough, in deposit or  repo, for a bank to be able   to economically use it.  We are assembling a special  interest group on cash and  liquidity management to  monitor, represent members  to regulators, and inform.

EU re-regulation of money market funds  (MMFs) is likely to finalise later this year.  Current leaning is towards low volatility  net asset value and variable net asset  value (VNAV) MMFs for corporates with  credit ratings. Redemption gates and fees  are expected.  Meanwhile, in the US, the Securities  and Exchange Commission rules will take  effect in October. These rules require that  funds switch to a VNAV from the constant,  $1-a-share value that the majority of funds  historically used constant NAV. The new  rules also require that funds introduce  redemption fees and other redemption  controls if a fund s weekly liquidity falls  below 30%. Treasurers need to revisit  their investment policies to ensure  boards understand the capital risk and  redemption uncertainty, and want to  continue to use MMFs.

This is why your   KYC has become exhaustive   and exhausting.   It also becomes frustrating  when your government claims  a country is open for business  while the Treasury will not  allow funds to go there. And  that includes the US Treasury  if you are trying to make forex  payments, because most would  go through the US dollar and   therefore a US dollar  bank account.  For treasurers, the  concern is that banks will  want your business to  represent it complies: in  new debt agreements;  renewable agreements (euro  medium-term note, facility  extensions); and ongoing  agreements, such as that CP  Trust Deed and Issuing and  Paying Agency Agreement   you wrote years ago.  The negative representation  is difficult except in any but the  smallest business operating  locally. Resist being asked to make  the representation that you have   no sanctions breaking  activity   because you  cannot know what every  employee and customer  is doing everywhere, all  the time. The positive  representation is more   comfortable and achievable:  to seek not to break sanctions  and to conform with those laws  applicable to your business   and transactions.  Also, it is essential now to  ensure your relationship manager  has the full business story to take  to his or her compliance team  and, of course, your governance  story to show why the positive  representation is valid.  { INTERNATIONAL }  BENCHMARK CHANGES On 1 June, Thomson  Reuters launched a new    FX benchmark, the WM/ Reuters 2pm Central Eastern  Time (CET). This new  benchmark is offered as an  alternative to the European  Central Bank s (ECB s) 2.15pm  CET reference rates, which  will be published at around  4pm CET from 1 July 2016.  While the ECB reference rates  will continue to be based   on a point-in-time snapshot   at 2.15pm CET, the change   in publication time is to  reinforce the distinction  between exchange-rate fixings  used for transaction purposes  and the ECB reference   rates that is intended for  information purposes only.   The new WM/Reuters 2pm  CET benchmark is available  across 150+ currencies against   the euro, pound sterling and  US dollar as a subscription  service. Corporates have free  access to the benchmark for  32 currencies against the euro  (those currently covered by  the ECB reference rate) with   a half-hour delay.  As a reminder of changes   to benchmark legislation   and methodologies, in    The Treasurer (June 2016)  we mentioned that the EU  Parliament passed legislation  on benchmarks such as the  Euro Interbank Offered Rate  and Libor to make them more  reliable and to remove the  conflicts of interest identified  in previous means of setting  interest rates.

After I graduated from university, I applied  for a management trainee programme at my  current employer. During my first months, I  undertook training secondments within various   departments of the enterprise. Once   I came across the treasury department,   I realised that this was the most interesting  area for me. What do you like about treasury? Every day brings something new: some brand  new challenges, new people, new market  environments. It provides huge opportunities  for my personal growth. Moreover, working  in treasury gives me a sense of having a real  impact on my company s development. And  that motivates me a lot. What s the most unusual responsibility that  you have as a treasurer? All of them are unusual. My family perceives  being a treasurer in rather a simple way: as  me sitting in a room full of golden coins and  counting them. And I have to say that, in a  sense, I find that to be true…  What s the most important lesson that  you ve learned during your career? Do not accept half measures and output that  contains errors   even minor ones. Small  shortcomings may lead to bigger issues, which  may then turn out to be irremediable. What s your ultimate career goal? To become a corporate treasurer.  If you weren t in treasury, what would you do  and why? I would probably be a gardener due to my  admiration of nature.

With the  near-death experience of   the financial crisis fresh in  everyone s minds and the  eurozone sovereign debt  meltdown about to kick   off, it was easy to see why   he said what he did.  Britain had one of the  largest budget and current  account deficits in Europe  and its creditworthiness as  a nation was being widely  questioned. As it turned out,  Gross could scarcely have  been more wrong. Since  then, gilt yields   which  move in inverse proportion  to prices   have gone down  and down, hitting historic  lows just recently. And it is  not just Britain. Elsewhere,  the decline in yields has been  even more extreme. The yield  on German 10-year bunds  has sunk to virtually zero,  while Japanese 15-year money  has slumped into negative  territory. Worldwide, there  are reckoned to be more  than $10 trillion worth of  government bonds trading on  a negative interest rate, with  many corporate bonds, too  now joining the sub-zero club.  Never before in history have  governments, or creditworthy   corporations, been able to  borrow so cheaply.  In part, these ultra-low  rates are the result of central  bank money printing. Britain  and the US ceased their  bond-buying programmes  (quantitative easing) some  time ago, but asset purchases  continue apace in the  eurozone and in Japan. If  bond yields are being driven  to zero in these regions, then  investors look for higher  yielding  risk-free  assets  elsewhere, so UK and US  yields fall, too.  Yet unconventional  monetary policy is as much  a consequence of the low  interest-rate environment  as a cause; there is a deeper,  underlying reason   the  so-called  savings glut .  Central banks are in truth  only responding to a broader   market-based fall in rates,  forcing them to reduce   official interest rates to   zero and beyond in order   to provide stimulus.  On a global basis,  corporations and   households are saving their  earnings rather than investing  and spending them, creating  a self-fulfilling climate of low  demand and poor growth.  Growing risk aversion forces  this excess of savings into  supposedly risk-free assets  such as US Treasuries,  German bunds and even UK  gilts. None of these securities  is at all likely to default, if  only because in extremis they  can all be serviced through  central bank money printing.  Investors are all but  guaranteed their money back,  yet in chasing these assets,  investment in productive  growth grinds to a halt.   The cautionary effects of  the financial crisis provide   a partial explanation for risk   aversion. In time, this ought  to pass. Yet, unfortunately,  there is also a rather more  pervasive and therefore  worrying one: demographics.  As societies age, they save  more to support themselves  in retirement, and they  spend and invest less freely.  Eventually, there will come   a tipping point, when retirees  will want to draw down their  savings rather than add to  them, but that may still be  some distance off.  In any case, today s negative  interest-rate environment  is having some perverse  consequences, creating   new bubbles in a number   of other asset classes such as  housing. There is also some  evidence to suggest that  wafer-thin returns are causing  companies and households to  save even more, thus further  crimping consumption and  investment. More worrying  still, the further yields  erode, the greater the risks  of catastrophic loss should  prices correct and yields rise  sharply again, as one day they  inevitably will.  Policymakers seem to   have run out of road. It s   hard to see how this low  interest-rate environment  ends, except badly.   If ageing populations are one of the drivers behind historically   low interest rates, then it s hard to see a remedy  JEREMY WARNER { INTEREST RATES }  The cautionary effects of the  financial crisis provide a partial  explanation for risk aversion  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer July/August 2016 The Treasurer  13  COMMENT    THE NEW HOME   OF ACT LEARNING  Visit the new home of ACT learning at:  academy.treasurers.org Join our global community of successful  professionals just like you.

But demographic problems  are hard to address in Japan. Even in  Europe, which has a long history of  cultural and ethnic variation, fears about  the impact of migration are at the top  of the public debate. For a country like  Japan, whose history has been less shaped  by migrants, the challenges are greater.   Japan faces a tough dilemma. While  trend growth for real GDP is virtually   zero, GDP per capita is rising as the  population shrinks. Japanese citizens  enjoy one of the highest standards of  living in the world. But the level of public  debt is unsustainable without a stronger  trend rate of economic growth. Allowing  more foreign workers to enter the  Japanese labour force could provide the  antidote. But as is often the case, the fixed- pie fallacy presents a big-policy obstacle.   The perception that total wealth is  limited and must be shared out better is   When prime minister Shinzō Abe  began his second term in December  2012, he introduced a policy strategy   with  three arrows  to kick-start Japan s  stalled economic engine. The first two  arrows, aggressive monetary policy and  fiscal injections, began immediately.   Early signs were promising as the boost   to demand temporarily lifted growth and  inflation. But the third arrow, supply-side  reform, has been woefully lacking. As a  result, the Japanese economy is stalling  again. European economies have much   to learn from the Japanese policy  experiment. Without proper economic  reform, costly stimulus programmes will  not lead to faster growth in the long term.  In Japan, interest-rate cuts and large- scale purchases of government bonds  by the central bank combined with  government spending following the  infrastructure that was damaged in  the 2011 earthquake lifted growth and  inflation during 2013. But in an attempt to  address the piling debt and the enormous  public deficit, Abe raised the rate of VAT  to 8% from 5% in April 2014. This had an  immediate negative effect, prompting two  subsequent quarters of negative growth.   To offset an appreciating yen and  in a further attempt to boost growth,  the central bank then eased again by  widening its purchases to further asset  classes. More recently, the Bank of Japan  joined the European Central Bank (ECB)  and set a negative policy rate. But despite  ultra-easy monetary policy, the economy  has slipped back into deflation and total  real GDP remains about the same size as  it was in 2008. Why? The problems of the  Japanese economy are not monetary in  nature. Further easing will not lift growth.  One of Japan s key problems lies in  its demographics: a shrinking labour   the false reasoning behind most attempts  to prevent migration or redistribute  incomes from the rich to the poor.  There is no good reason why a properly  managed economy cannot continue to  grow and provide an improving standard  of living for all its existing and new  citizens. But for an economy like Japan,  where the pie hasn t grown in almost a  decade, overcoming this misconception   is easier said than done.   Europe s major economies can indeed  learn from Japan s economic quandary.  Rising right-wing populism in core  Europe reflects a frustration by its  citizens that is rooted in the sluggish  improvement in general living standards  since the financial crisis. And while the  ultra-aggressive policies of the Bank of  England in the UK and the ECB policy in  the eurozone have helped to lift Europe  from the depths of recession, growth  cannot accelerate further without proper  economic reform. Inflexible labour  markets in Italy and France, land and  planning policies not fit for purpose in the  UK and the reversal of some of the 2004  labour market reforms in Germany pose  the major threats to long-term economic  prosperity in these economies. The  Japanese economy is where it is because  the country has shied away from essential  reforms for many years. There is no easy  road out for Japan. For the UK and other  European countries, Japan serves as an  example of the problems ahead if they do  not implement the necessary reforms to  raise trend growth soon.   Lessons to be learnt   in Europe from Japan With debt running ragged and growth virtually at zero,   improvement seems a remote prospect for the Japanese economy  ECONOMIC TRENDS  Kallum Pickering is  senior UK economist  at Berenberg Bank  The Japanese economy is where it is because it has  shied away from essential reforms for many years  16  The Treasurer July/August 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer    I spent a few days planning  for the announcement and  transition, to make sure  there would be continuity  for counterparties; they  do matter. Overall, I have  decided to approach  this change of direction  positively, even if there is  a part of me that feels this is a  boost to others  development  as much as mine. I guess   I have to achieve a balance  between my sense of pride  on the one hand and the  realities of life as a finance  leader on the other   even  if there is an impact on my  career aspirations.  After all, how bad can it  be? I will be supporting   a different manager, a  respected non-finance CEO   A lot of key moments in  my career have arisen as  a result of unexpected   conversations. Today was one  such occasion. I was called  into a meeting with the CFO  and the HR director.  This  must be serious,” I thought.  And not for the first time.  I was told that the team  was in such good shape  that I was to be released  into a different role   an  opportunity to head into   a challenging business unit,  initially on a special project,  to develop my career more  broadly. One of the divisions  needs some fresh financial  thinking, apparently, and   I was the person to inject it.  I had always suspected that  this particular unit had gone  native and I imagine I have  been chosen because I am   a good corporate citizen.   The powers that be are  unclear how long this project  role will last or where it s  heading, but sometimes  there s uncertainty in  life   they told me. I went  through the motions of  asking whether this is a  promotion and whether  it s optional or not. The  predictable response was:   No, but it will be career  enhancing”, followed.   At least I m not being  asked to run the shared  service centre. And, of  course, it does present the  opportunity to go a little  native myself (although  not too much   that would  be rather hypocritical).  Perhaps it will be me asking   for covenant-lite borrowing  or being unhappy when the  divisional hedge positions  are out of the money?  Of course, I will hopefully  have a route back at some  stage and I can certainly  watch from a distance how  my team develops without  my guidance. They may even  miss me   you never know.   It may also be the case  that I have spent too long  at corporate head office and  that I ought to get out into  the real world. If nothing  else, I will see how the other  half operates. Other than  a short spell many years  ago, I have spent very little  time away from corporate  HQ and I have learnt a great  deal on the occasions that  I have.  { TREASURY INSIDER }  Time for a change Treasury Insider is wholeheartedly embracing new opportunities.

It s a chance to  establish myself in a new  area, while keeping the  same disciplines of control,  communication and  competence that I have   built up over the years.  There is the realisation  that in my new role I will  have to be taken seriously  when it comes to funding  requests, cash flows and  forecasting, as well as the  fact that others will probably  have high expectations.  I imagine that s natural  and I mustn t grumble.  I believe that treasurers  can adapt and operate in   a number of roles. It is best  not to be typecast. I hope  the experience will make  me stronger and I will stay  in touch with the network  and attend events, of course.  However, I will miss day-to- day strategic treasury matters  and being part of such an  essential function   where  cash, or access to it, is the  lifeblood of the organisation  and vital to its survival.

So, initial thoughts for a treasurer  might be: • Sit down with the FD and   management team, and understand  the big picture internally. Consider  carefully what disclosures are made   to the markets;  • Talk to relationship banks, lenders  and debt investors, and understand  what they are thinking and what their  worries are; and  The events of 23 June clearly  surprised some more than  others   and, as we all know,   the one thing that markets hate  is surprises… and this isn t a  UK-only issue.  It is clear that it will take  some considerable time for  the political process and EU  negotiations to be completed  (or even provide any degree of  clarity). But in the meantime,  the wheels of the real economy  must continue to turn, and so  management teams   including  treasurers   need to start  planning and finding solutions  as soon as possible.   From a treasurer s perspective,  this stage of the process is all  about planning, communication  and disclosure. This is not the  time for the treasurer to hide  themselves away   they need  to be involved in every Brexit  conversation and party to   all decisions. And they need   to be looking both inwards   and externally.   There is the internal angle:  it is vitally important that the  treasury team is fully embedded  into the business, not only  to provide support to those  businesses that are having to  adjust their strategic plans, but also   to ensure that any planning includes   the impact on financial risk and   funding. For example, if the decision  is made to restructure or relocate,  this may have an impact on foreign  currency exposures and local borrowing  requirements. Given the high degree of  uncertainty, chances are there ll be more  than one plan, too… More prosaically,  treasurers also need to revisit treasury  policies and ensure that they still  work   in the post-Brexit world and are being  adhered to.  Then there is the external angle:  strong and effective relationships with  debt investors and relationship banks  (the sources of finance and hedging)  are critical. The high volatility in FX   • Talk to their legal advisers,    particularly about    continuity of contracts    and covenant compliance.  Of course, all this talk   of Brexit overlooks a few     minor  points: even before the  referendum there were building  pressures from low (or even  negative) interest rates; slowing  growth in many parts of the  world (not just the mature  Western economies); changes   in accounting rules and other  regulation that will result in the  grossing up of the balance sheet  with the resulting impact on  financial covenants, credit  ratings, etc; increased bank  regulation feeding through   to the real economy; growing  political instability   not just  emanating from the Middle  East, but also from the  forthcoming US elections.   As for the strains that were  beginning to show in the  eurozone, these have not been  helped by the vote on 23 June.  To summarise, we are now  in the Brexit planning phase    and need to be prepared to  make many plans, safe in the  knowledge that none of them   will quite fit the bill when the time  comes. But treasurers are excellent  problem-solvers, so should relish the  opportunity to really get stuck in.

He joined as group treasurer in 2013, a year  after the utility s French owners, Veolia Water, sold the company  to a group of infrastructure investors. His remit was to build up  the treasury function of the now renamed water company.  Apart from some local cash management, most treasury work  had previously been carried out centrally by Veolia s Paris head  office.  It had a bond outstanding, but that was it. All the funding  came from central intercompany sources,” Kennedy says.  Today, the company has a whole business securitisation  structure in place, similar to other water-industry players, such  as Anglian and Thames. Soon after joining, Kennedy issued a  number of bonds and refinanced bank debt.  I joined to manage  what had been put in place, but also look to raise new debt in  the future, raise other loan facilities. There was a huge process   of setting everything up from scratch,” he says.  A brush with regulation Last year, the UK water industry s financial regulator finalised   its latest five-year price-review process. Water companies submit  their business plans to Ofwat, which looks at spending plans,  measures them against an industry average for cost of capital and  then sets limits to customer prices and revenues. It s an onerous  process with reputations on the line. Affinity came out of the  exercise with an  enhanced status  rating   an endorsement of  the company s engagement work with customers and its asset  and financial management. But the pressure remains.  If we  outperform in the next five years, the company gets to keep  more of the over-performance. If it underperforms, the penalties  are greater, so money goes back to the customer,” says Kennedy.  Treasury has a direct link to the price-review process. The  weighted average cost of capital that Ofwat looks for when it  evaluates business plans is inextricably tied to the cost of equity  and debt.   Once bills are set, we are always looking to make sure we  manage our debt well, but we also have a set cost of debt for the  industry that you need to make sure you perform well against.  Otherwise the costs will flow through to our shareholders  directly. There s no way to pass on higher cost of debt. It gives  treasury quite a high profile,” he says.  One year into this asset management period and Affinity has  some big numbers to chase. Like a lot of water companies, it s    Like many postgraduates, Shaun Kennedy came out of university, Warwick and then Lancaster, with a grand  plan   in his case to become a computer programmer.  And like many other tech aspirants at the time, his early   ambitions fell victim to the dotcom crash of 2001, when he was  made redundant from a job with a financial trading software  company  along with a load of other people”, he says.  Looking round for a temporary job, Kennedy started working  at a housing association, Circle 33.  That s how I got my start in  treasury,” he explains.  It wasn t planned and I went in knowing  very little about what treasury involved.” The head of treasury,  Nathan Dunton (now group treasurer at Virgin Atlantic), was  leading a growing team, however, and proved to be a persuasive  and supportive mentor. And there was a lot going on. As treasury  officer to begin with, Kennedy gained experience of day-to- day cash-flow management. The organisation merged with  Anglia Housing Group in 2005 and, by then treasury manager,  Kennedy worked on debt and investment portfolios, banking  relationships, intercompany lending and treasury accounting.  He also began work on his ACT qualifications.  In 2006, he moved to Notting Hill Housing Trust as treasury  manager. Again, this was an organisation in transition. The trust  had been in difficulties with the regulator and had little in the  way of treasury infrastructure. Kennedy built up the treasury  function and, as well as finishing his AMCT there, he secured  the trust s first credit rating with Moody s, issued its first capital  markets bond for £180m in 2010 and a subsequent £120m tap   a year later. He also set up the trust s first joint ventures.  At this point, having spent most of his career to date   in housing, Kennedy realised it was time to do something  different, so he joined SmartestEnergy, a subsidiary of Japanese  multinational Marubeni and an independent electricity  buyer.  It was a very different business to ones I d worked in.  Housing associations make a lot of long-term investments.  SmartestEnergy was much more short term in its focus, so I d  gone from having loan facilities and debt stretching out 40 years  ahead to an environment where loans were typically 18 months.”   In it for the long term While he enjoyed his two years at SmartestEnergy, Kennedy  missed the capital markets work and the different interaction  he d had with banks in the housing sector.

For Affinity, that represents   a £500m investment for the period while also looking to improve  water quality and encourage customers to use less water in   a hard-pressed area.    A large proportion of what we re spending this £500m on is  what we call the water-saving programme, which includes water  metering. We re metering 280,000 households over the next five  years to reduce water use, to reduce demand,” he says. Once   a meter is installed, a householder has two years to change their  habits if they re using too much water before they are moved  to a metered bill, or they can switch to a metered tariff before  this if they see a saving.  There s a big education piece that  sits alongside the metering process: the South East is a water- stressed area. We have invested in new plants to ensure high  water quality and a huge amount of new infrastructure to reduce  leakage. If we can reduce leakage, we can extract less and leave  more water in the environment, which is an important part of  our plan.”  Affinity has undertaken to reduce leaks by 14% over the next  five years and has committed to a 5% reduction in the price its  customers pay for their water.   Payments Payments is an area where the treasury function comes close  to its domestic customers. The public is far less traditional in  its payment choices now, which means more digital payment  methods are needed alongside the traditional ones. Direct  debit is still very important, he says, but not all customers like  it. Cheques, cash and Transcash still play their part, as well as  payment apps like Pingit. Kennedy sits on the Payments Strategy  Forums  end user working group, representing corporate  treasurers (after accepting an invitation from the ACT) and  keeps a close eye on developments.  There might be other new  technologies that come along and there is a trade-off in terms of  costs. We ve also got to be mindful of people s preferences   we   still accept cheques, for instance. And there s a huge amount  of change coming in terms of cheque processing with digital  imaging. It s been really interesting to get more involved in that.”  Raising funds The fundraising underpinning the investment programme  is a core responsibility and focus for Kennedy. His first foray  into capital markets after joining Affinity came in July 2014  via a reverse auction, which raised £50m.  We wanted to try  something a bit different in terms of discovering the best price  when issuing the bond. It takes it out of our hands and the  banks  hands, and says to investors: you bid what you re willing   to pay for on our credit and we ll see where we end up,” he says.  Affinity also raised £40m a year later via a private placement  with a single investor. The opportunity arose through investor      VITAL STATISTICS 900   million litres a day     average demand  1.1 billion litres a day    peak demand  1.5 million domestic and  commercial   properties served  3.5  million customers  160   litres per person   per day   average  water use  4,500km2 supply area  16,500km water mains  98 treatment works  192 service reservoirs  and water towers  121 boreholes  1.39  million household   connections    www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer July/August 2016 The Treasurer  23  engagement, he says, which is an area he devotes much more  attention to in this role than in previous ones.  How the private placement came about was that regulatory  and accounting changes meant that some of Affinity s financial  covenants didn t make sense any more and prompted a round of  investor engagement.  We went to see a lot of our bondholders  through a roadshow process and talked to them about the  changes. We needed a vote to change all the documentation   we had in place to put in new covenants,” he explains.  Private placement in the UK is an area with a great deal  of potential, he says. There are certainly opportunities with  Affinity s existing bondholders   corporate investors such as  M&G, Standard Life and Legal & General.  UK investors are  looking for opportunities; they re looking to invest. It s easy for  me to say with a UK-regulated utility with a good credit rating,  but I think there are probably more opportunities for us.”   The roadshow opened up discussions and questions on whether  Affinity Water would issue more debt.  So we ended up privately  placing the deal with a single investor. Following on from that  [engagement] process, we tapped another existing bond, but  placed it privately with a single investor on a delayed basis. Again  it was quite different the way we structured it,” he says.  The revisions to the covenants, the roadshow, the bond  issue and the private placement all came together to treasury s  benefit. As a result, treasury   Kennedy and treasury analyst  Poonam Depala   was nominated for a company award for  outstanding commercial acumen, which it won.  For the  business to recognise that we re making a contribution to   what the company is trying to deliver was very rewarding.”  Affinity is likely, he says, to go back to the bond market one  more time in this asset management period.  We ve got enough  cash to see us through for the next 18 months. We have loan  facilities as well, but we try and pre-fund as much as we can and  lock into rates, without trying to carry too much cash.   We re not a huge issuer compared to some other corporates.  We do quite small deals more frequently   so this £50m reverse  auction or the deal we did placing £40m with one investor, for  instance, rather than running a £250m benchmark deal,” he says.  The water industry s regulatory framework is a core focus for  investors, who are keen to talk about any developments on that  front. The big talking point currently is inflation and the move  to the consumer price index (CPI) from the retail price index  (RPI).  Investors are incredibly aware of it because the way that  the water sector regulation has been built has been around  real cost. We have a lot of RPI debt outstanding as do a lot of  our peers, so transition to CPI throws up a lot of interesting  questions. It s another risk to manage. We have an RPI-linked  bond out to 2045. [Our investors] are committed to us for quite   a long time. They should quite rightly be interested.”  But while the engagement with bondholders and the  successful rounds of fundraising have been rewarding, the  company award has been a genuine highlight for Kennedy.   To win an award and be able to tell people what we re up to   is really satisfying. Just to have the wider company know that   we in finance are doing innovative things   that s been incredibly  satisfying to have that feedback.”   Liz Loxton is editor of The Treasurer   We re not a huge issuer compared   to some other corporates.

He recommends preparing for the  meeting itself by doing a run-through  with peers.  That way, you can get wider  challenge before you brief and also  explore the  what if   scenarios,” he says.  Rando Bruns, head of group treasury  at German pharmaceutical company  Merck KGaA, has interactions with  three different boards in his role   a  management board, a supervisory board  and a family board (Merck is 70% owned  by family shareholders). Bruns mostly  engages with the management board and  the family board. The management board  is currently focused on the company s  credit rating in light of its $17bn  acquisition of Sigma-Aldrich, the largest  acquisition in the company s history.  Meanwhile, the family board is regularly  interested in financial risk management,  particularly the company s management  of pension risk and its use of derivatives  to mitigate FX and interest-rate risk.    The management board is very close   to the operational business so you don t  have to explain as much to them as you  do to the family board,” says Bruns.  While treasurers don t normally  present at board meetings in the Middle  East, Gary Slawther attends all the board  meetings for his company, Oman-based  packaging company OCTAL. The board  consists of five members, comprising  the CEO, three directors who represent  the investors and one non-executive  director who has a chemical engineering  background. Slawther has a treasury  background, but because his job title  is  financial adviser to the CEO , he  actually addresses a range of topics in his  report. This could be from the previous  quarter s results and the current cash and  financing position through to marketing  and new products.   The business culture of the Middle  East has an impact on which aspects  of treasury are discussed at the board  meetings, Slawther says.  This is still   the place where cheques reign supreme,  so there is always a big focus on cash   and liquidity. There is also a big focus    A treasurer s place is in the  boardroom. Not all of the time, of  course, but some of the time at least.   That is one of the principal findings of  The Contemporary Treasurer 2016, the  ACT s latest research into the evolving  influence of treasury on corporate  financial strategy and business growth.   Nearly 200 treasurers across the UK,  continental Europe, Asia-Pacific, the  Middle East and North America were  interviewed for the study, which found  that treasurers globally are contributing  far more strategic advice to their  organisations than they did five years ago.   It is not just business strategy that  treasurers report on, however. Their  board reports tend to encompass a  broad range of subjects, from capital  and liquidity management and risk  management through to corporate  finance, treasury operations and controls,  and pensions management.   So just what does presenting treasury  matters to the board entail? And is it  really the horrifying prospect that it  might seem?  Prepare to succeed At energy giant Centrica, group treasurer  Katherine Horrell reports to the  12-strong board on an annual basis. If  she is presenting to the board in person  rather than just providing a written  report, Horrell makes sure that she s very  familiar with her report and the treasury  policies before she enters the boardroom.   If I m presenting in person, I would  normally go through it with the CFO  beforehand and agree the headlines we  want to bring out,” she says.  But mostly  I prepare by reading through what I ve  submitted and making sure I ve got the  latest information on topical issues. The  board has asked about eurozone volatility  in the past, for example.”  Private equity- (PE) owned foam  manufacturer the Vita Group has a  board of four comprising the CEO, a  bank-appointed representative and two  directors nominated by the PE owners.  Board meetings are held four times a year  and group treasurer Chris King prepares  written reports for each board meeting.  From time to time, he may also be asked  to present.  King s written reports are normally  PowerPoint presentations on two or three  topics   with no more than four slides per   on what is happening now in terms   of the commercial operations   the  immediate future is far more important  than what will happen in five years    time.” A tendency towards risk aversion  and secrecy in business also means   that boards are highly interested in  protecting their markets and keeping  competitors out.   Question time Horrell says that the questions posed  by her board will vary according to the  nature of the issues facing the company at  the time. Centrica suffered a downgrade  in 2015, which has made the company s  credit rating a key priority for the board.   The credit rating has been one of the key  issues for us over the past three or four  years,” she explains.  But in 2013, we did   a debut bond issue in the US, so it tends  to be whatever is topical in treasury.”  Nevertheless, it is a case of  expect the  unexpected  when it comes to questions   because they can be on any topic.  You  can put out a paper that covers all the  work you ve done in the past year and  you might expect questions in one area,  but then get asked questions in another,”  Horrell says.   With King s board, questions tend   to cover a lot of  what if?  scenarios.    So if we re working on a pension issue,  it might be: what is within the trustees   powers in terms of how they could react  to our proposal?” He tries to answer the  questions he can and then gets back to  the board on any he can t answer at the  time.  You cannot know everything and   a good board is likely to have questions  you can t always answer,” he says.  But  you should prepare sufficiently so that  they are isolated questions rather than  every question.”  When it comes to answering questions,  Slawther says it is important to be both  diplomatic and respectful.  If I don t  know the answer to a question, I ll take  it away and do some research and then  come back with an answer at the next  board meeting.” IKO  N  IM  A G  ES    26  The Treasurer July/August 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer   TOP TIPS FOR PRESENTING TO THE BOARD  IK O  N  IM  A G  ES  Limit the messages that you want to  make to as few messages as possible  and keep them simple.   Use graphics and visuals to convey  key points in a straightforward way.  For example, a graphic of a 13-week  cash-flow forecast showing that  you re outperforming your budget   or underperforming your budget   gets the message across very clearly.  With written reports, remember   to tailor your content towards the  end audience.   Flag up potential risks early   for  example, if projections show the  organisation could breach financial  covenants or liquidity is tighter than  planned. Then say which actions  treasury is taking to mitigate   those risks.  Don t ask the board to consider   very difficult or technical issues.   Avoid using the board meeting as an  opportunity to announce surprises    either bad ones or apparently good  ones. They won t go down well with  any of the directors   particularly not  the CFO.    INSIGHT  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer July/August 2016 The Treasurer  27  Sally Percy is a business and finance  journalist, and former editor of The Treasurer  Bruns tries to translate common  treasury terms into terms that board  members find easy to understand.    The members of our management   board are experts in pharma, chemicals,  R&D or HR,” he says.  So I do not assume   they know all the treasury terms and   I try to keep my presentation simple.   I try to translate treasury-specific terms  into terms they use more typically. For  example, in treasury we might talk about   ratios of cash flow to debt, but you can  translate this into what it means in terms  of EBITDA or profits or sales.”  Bruns adds that while boards tend   to have a good understanding of the  needs of equity investors, they can be   less familiar with what debt investors  require. So some background briefing  from treasury is useful in this respect.   With debt investors, the contact is  usually just with treasury or the CFO,”  he says.  Equity markets work differently  from debt markets. An equity investor   is interested in a growth story and wants  a higher share price. A debt investor  wants their money back. They have  different interests.”   It would be nerve- wracking if there were  questions I couldn t answer,  so preparation is key”  Scary stuff? So is presenting to the board really  terrifying?  It can be a bit daunting   to present to the board as they are  very senior and you don t know them,”  acknowledges Horrell, whose board  includes Rick Haythornthwaite,  previously CEO of one-time FTSE 100  engineering company Invensys, and  Carlos Pascual, formerly a senior adviser  to the US Secretary of State on energy  issues.  But I have always found the  atmosphere in meetings to be supportive  and helpful. They want to understand  your area, rather than trip you up, so   I have found it to be a positive experience.”  Slawther admits that he relishes the  challenge.  It s not nerve-wracking,”   he says.  It s more like an exam. If you re  well prepared and feel confident about  being able to answer questions, you  should do well, but you should never  get complacent. Also, a certain amount  of adrenalin pumping helps you to  concentrate and focus. It would be   nerve-wracking if I felt I didn t know my  stuff or there were questions I couldn t  answer, so preparation, preparation and  preparation is key   even if it s   last-minute cramming.”  If the thought of presenting to the  board gives you minor palpitations,   you can take comfort from the fact   you probably won t need to do it for   long. Most of the treasurers interviewed  for this article normally address the  board for between 10 and 20 minutes   in total.   When you present in person to the  board, you have quite a limited window  in which to do it,” explains Horrell.  Also,  often your slot never comes up quite at  the time you re scheduled for   they re  running ahead or they re running behind.  You might have to speak within a shorter  time frame, or just take questions. So you  need to be flexible.”  Seen and heard Some boards have a greater  understanding of treasury matters than  others. So PE boards tend to have a good  grip on cash, for example, and Horrell  says that Centrica s board is  well versed”  on treasury issues and financial risks.  Nevertheless, regardless of the overall  level of treasury knowledge among the  board, presenting to the board is still  a great opportunity to raise the profile  of treasury within the organisation and  remind the organisation s most senior  figures of all the great work that treasury  does. Fortunately, leading treasuries have  already got this worked out.    Our board sees treasury as the  custodian of financial risk management,”  says King.  So when there is market  volatility, they are very keen for us to   be present.”   The CFO s view David Tilston, former CFO of  banknote substrate maker Innovia  Group, has experience of sitting  both sides of the table when it  comes to treasury presentations.   As a corporate treasurer earlier in  his career, he reported to the board  on matters including financial  covenants, liquidity and refinancing.  More recently, he has sat in board  meetings while the treasury team  has been presenting.  Tilston s advice for treasurers  who are called before the board is  not to talk about treasury in depth.   It s best to avoid having the board  thinking about very difficult or  technical issues,” he says.  Warn  them of any issues and then serve   the answer on a plate so they are   in a position to monitor the delivery  of the solution. Getting into  complicated discussions of treasury  matters is not something to be  done around the boardroom table.”  Where treasurers slip up in front  of the board, it is usually in two  ways, Tilston explains. The first is   by  making the presentations too  technical and assuming a degree   of treasury knowledge that may   not be there for the majority   of non-execs”. Secondly, they   don t manage to convey the key  messages clearly enough.  As a board member, Tilston   is focused on the following areas  when assessing treasury s report:   have we approved a policy around  this area and are we complying with  that policy currently? Is our trading  on track from a cash and financial  covenant perspective? And if I look  at the forward projections   be they  on cash, financial covenants, funding  or currency   are we projected to be  on track with our expectations or  are things beginning to deteriorate?  Then, if they are deteriorating, does  the management team have a  sensible plan in place that it is likely  to deliver? At subsequent board  meetings, I ll want an update on   the deterioration and whether   our mitigation plans are working.  Treasury does have a role in  supporting the board s strategic   decision-making, Tilston confirms.   If the board is looking to expand  the company and that s going to  require significant debt or equity  funding, the treasurer has to  immediately deal with strategic  issues,” he says.  If they know   it can t be done, or the risks are  unsustainable, then they are  duty-bound to ensure the board  understands this. Similarly, if   it can be done, the treasurer is   tasked with delivering the relevant  debt packages in a way that  supports the acquisition or the  expansion. But it s pointless for   the board to get excited about   a debt-finance acquisition if it s   not deliverable.”    Treasury operations Treasury operations infrastructure  THE RFP CAN BE A BEWILDERING AND EVEN INTIMIDATING EXERCISE.  ANDREW BURGESS SUGGESTS SOME WAYS FORWARD  May the best bank win   You ve been overheard saying  there s got to be a better way” about the  banking. Now somebody  wants you to find that better  way   and to prove its worth  before the firm puts its money  where your mouth is.   The request for proposal  (RFP) is the classic way to  gather information about the  complex range of services a  bank provides. Done right,  it lets the banks know what  you are looking for. It conveys  that you are serious about  changing or adding services,   and want the best fit for your  needs as well as requiring  those needs to be assessed  fairly and professionally. The  desired outcome: a smooth  transition to improved  business function and  profitability. Done wrong,  it s a time-consuming waste  of resources that confuses  everybody and results in  the business overpaying for  functions it doesn t really  need, ones that might even  impede normal functionality.   The usual procedure is you  generate a report (the RFP)   detailing what you are looking  for from your future bank  and asking how they would  meet the requirements you  set out. This is sent round  several candidate banks. The  banks respond with written  suggestions. You select a  shortlist to meet and enter  into more detailed discussions  with. From those discussions,   a final decision is made. Ideally,  this should not be the point  where you realise that the  wrong questions were asked  at the start and that the whole  exercise needs to be repeated.   The two key stages are:  drafting the RFP and the  discussions with the banks. An  analogy would be a promising  new graduate drafting a CV  and having multiple job  interviews. You get to choose  which employer, but it better  be a good choice, because  once you are committed to  investing your future with one  firm, it is expensive in time,  money and lost opportunity  to change track if they don t  behave as expected, or if they  do, but you discover that this  is not what you really wanted.   28  The Treasurer July/August 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer     www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer July/August 2016 The Treasurer  29  May the best bank win • Your biases: does anyone   involved in the process  have noticeable feelings  for or against any of the  banks involved? Identify  if ABC bank missold your  first mortgage or XYZ bank  employs your nephew,   and then neutralise any  non-relevant impact on   the decision.  Not all this data needs to  go in the RFP itself, and some  definitely shouldn t, but you  need to clarify what matters  for your decision-making.  Then you can produce the  questions to give you all the  answers needed.  Letting the first draft RFP  sit untouched for a few days  before coming back and  checking it with fresh eyes   is almost always useful   as   is a proofreader. Once it s good  to go, send it out and wait for  the replies.  The interview process Once the written answers  have been sorted down to a  shortlist, it s time to get face to  face with the banks. You might  want to consider having a wild- card bank that barely makes  the shortlist as a first-practice  interview for what to expect.  Who to take to the  interview? The short answer to  this is: anyone whose opinion  you d respect and want to take  into consideration. Specialists  from cash management and   IT support are pretty much   a given. Everyone takes notes  and everyone picks up on  different things. You shouldn t  worry, either, about asking  more questions for clarification  later   it s not as if the bank  will refuse. Do discuss each  interview afterwards, however,   Drafting the RFP To do this well you need to  know where you are, where  you want to get to and ideally  how you would like to travel.  So you need to think about the  following issues: • Your scope: are you looking   for a new main relationship  bank; a zero-balancing pool  provider; a quick access to  the Single Euro Payments  Area system; or a well-placed  bank in your new target  growth market?  • Your current actual situation  as it is; not as it should be.  It is best if this is backed  up by descriptive statistical  data of the volume and  type of transactions you  actually have to process,  both regularly and on those  special circumstances that  in practice turn up so often.  • Your intended end result,  ideally both the perfect and  acceptable cases.  • Your priorities for making  the decision; in ranked order  (none of this  they re both  equally important  rubbish).  If everything else was equal,  which factor would swing  the decision?  • Your deal breakers: what the  bank must be able to deliver  should be front and centre.  There is little point being at  the point of signing having  failed to ask:  by the way, are  you able to implement this  by the end of next month?”,  for instance.  • Your decision-makers: if  corporate finance head  office will be making the  final call based on global  funding provision alone,  then there is little point  asking regional treasury  hubs to do a detailed RFP   to assess transaction costs.     •  Official publication  ACT MIDDLE EAST  ANNUAL SUMMIT  THE NEW AGE OF THE GULF 24-25 October 2016, Dubai, UAE   The pre-eminent   networking event   in the region for   senior finance   professionals.

If it s  something genuinely   missed out of the  document, don t forget   to highlight it to the other  banks. Your aim is to have  a level information playing  field (but do note which  bank did the more diligent  research and found the  omission early).  • As in any sales situation,  rubbishing a rival bank s  services, rather than talking  up their own, usually  tells you who the bankers  in front of you are most  worried about.   both to check everyone  understood it the same way  and to identify areas to check  in the next interview.   What you want to find  out is: • What they offer and how    it meets your needs. • What they can actually   deliver, ideally with minimal  discrepancies to the above.  • When it will be in place, and  how the bank deals with  implementation problems.  • What it will cost, and that  this quote is guaranteed.  • How it will operate once   in place.  • Who your contacts are   and their availability.  • Any systems limitations  or changes needed; and a  strong sense of how robust  the solution is likely to be.  • Any legal restrictions on  yourselves or the bank.  • Expected functional life    if next year s regulatory  change means it won t be  functional, why install it?

What they can offer is:  • Data collection about what you do. Often this is simply going and talking  to the operational-level staff, then presenting it as high-end insight. Talk  to your own people first and don t pay for what you ve already got.   • Outsider perspective: having to answer  why do you really want that?”  before the RFP is drafted can avoid habitual thinking becoming a   key criterion.  • Data collation: if your team is too stretched to go back through 10 years  of bank statements to check the level, this can be farmed out.  • Editing the draft RFP and checking it includes all the relevant data not  just that matching the function of interest: there s little point having a  great cash-pooling system, if your new bank won t deal with exotic, but  commercially important currencies.   • Added experience and authority: provided they have done several  end-to-end RFPs before. This can both anticipate implementation  problems and defuse sales techniques.   The key with consultants is to make it clear from the outset they ll be  assessed by how effectively the implementation of the RFP decision goes  (as will you). If future support is needed to deal with the problems, you ll   be getting it from your new consultants.     32  The Treasurer July/August 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Treasury operations Financial products and markets  On the other hand,  stronger-than-expected  economic growth in China  may stop the rate cuts and  stunt the growth of the Panda  bond market. Also, a more  gradual-than-expected rate  hike in the US or a more  aggressive-than-expected  rate cut in Europe could  cause competition for  offshore liquidity that would,  otherwise, be aimed at   Panda bonds.  It is important to note that  the PBOC s rate cuts alone  may not necessarily make it  cheaper to issue Panda bonds.  First, issuers have to find it  attractive to issue Panda bonds  (versus bonds denominated  in other currencies). Second,  investors may have a better  alternative to Panda bonds in  which to invest. The former  will depend on the speed of a  rate hike in the US versus that  of rate cuts in the eurozone   curve on Panda bonds, but  many investors have seen  the People s Bank of China  (PBOC) as reactive, rather  than proactive, when it comes  to regulating new products.  No matter whether the  sentiment is right or wrong,  Chinese regulators need to  move fast to clarify the official  rules in order for the Panda  bond market to grow at all.  While we believe that PBOC  will take its time announcing  the new rules, we expect the  rules to favour Panda bond  development. We just hope  the ruling will not come too  late now that US dollar bond  issuances are picking up.  2. Continued rate cuts The PBOC cut rates to  stimulate China s slowing  economy. In our view,  investors  expectation of  further rate cuts generates  mark-to-market (MTM) gain  expectation for Panda bond  investors with renminbi  as a natural currency. In  addition, the declining yield  environment in China will  lower the funding cost and  refinancing risk for Panda  bond issuers.   and China. The latter  will depend on whether  investors can still expect   attractive MTM gains on  Panda bonds or whether   they think US dollar or  euro bonds will offer them  better returns. For example,   should the US Federal Reserve  (the Fed) raise rates more  gradually than expected, US  dollar bonds will perform  unexpectedly well relative  to Panda bonds, and foreign  investors could decrease  their bond portfolio weight  dedicated to Panda bonds.  Likewise, should the European  Central Bank lower rates more  aggressively than expected,  European issuers may find it  cheaper to issue euro bonds  rather than Panda bonds.  3. Liquidity The PBOC s rate cuts will  boost liquidity for Panda  bonds, but onshore liquidity  could also stem from a capital- control mechanism and/or a  return of investors  confidence  in the renminbi s value  against the US dollar. China s  slowing economic growth and  declining investor confidence  in renminbi s value against    If the Panda bond  market is to return to growth, it will need  encouragement. Here we look  at five areas where regulators,  providers and other market  players could help make this  product more attractive and  familiar to the international  investment community.   1. More clarity   on Panda   bond regulations We desperately need  improvement in Chinese  regulations and transparency  of the Panda bond issuance  procedure. Unlike UK,   Hong Kong or US laws,  governing most international  bonds, Chinese regulations   (ie bankruptcy law) remain  untested and/or unknown   to foreign issuers and  investors. Investors will need  to be able to price the bonds,  based not only on the ability  to service debt, but also on   the willingness to do so. The  latter requires knowledge  of the Chinese law and  regulations governing   Panda bonds.  Chinese regulators are  moving up a steep learning   PANDA BONDS ARE KEY INSTRUMENTS IN  THE EFFORT TO TRANSFORM CHINA S LOAN   MARKET INTO A TRULY INTERNATIONAL BOND  MARKET, BUT DEVELOPMENT HAS SLOWED.

More savvy investors  will encourage Chinese  issuers to meet international  disclosure standards. In our  view, improving disclosures  in China is crucial for the  country s transition to a more  international financial hub.  In other words, a lack of   transparency will also stall the  development of Panda bonds.  5. Credit-quality  differentiation Investors will need to be able  to differentiate credit quality  among Panda bonds whether  it is through credit ratings,  in-house credit teams, asset  managers and/or sell-side  research houses.  The PBOC requires that  all Panda bonds be rated by  Chinese credit rating agencies  (although the central bank has  approved some exemptions).   4. Attractiveness   to investors In addition to returns,  we believe the following  characteristics will increase  demand for Panda bonds.  First, Panda bonds, issued by  familiar international issuers,  will save investors extra  credit work. In our view, this  familiarity with issuers will  lead to Panda bonds becoming   even more liquid than CNY  bonds (issued by onshore  Chinese issuers). Better  knowledge of issuers will allow  investors to better differentiate  credit quality, translating into  spread differentials between  strong versus weak credits, in  our opinion. The development   of the renminbi bond market  depends on knowledgeable  and well-informed investors  who can price bonds  efficiently. Panda bonds  could eventually attract more  international investors, which  will make available more  research and opinions.  Second, we believe Panda  bond development will  introduce more international  issuers to China. These issuers  will bring with them a more   the US dollar have hampered  offshore renminbi liquidity.   Overall, we expect the  majority of Panda bond  demand to come from existing  onshore liquidity, not offshore  liquidity. First, there is  onshore liquidity that cannot  be easily deployed outside  China. Second, Panda bonds  will offer onshore investors no  currency risk and more capital  gain opportunities on the  easing cycle in China.  PBOC has raised onshore  liquidity through different  tools, such as reserve  requirement ratio (RRR) cuts,  rate cuts and the PBOC s  reverse repurchase agreement  activities. China s M2 money  supply rose 12.8% year-over- year in April (below a median  estimate of a Bloomberg  economist survey of 13.5%).  The central bank lowered  its RRR for major Chinese  banks four times in 2015 to  the current 17.5% (China s  RRR was 20% from May 2012  to February 2015). Falling  inflation in China enabled  PBOC to cut rates to boost the  Chinese economy. A 40-base  point one-year benchmark  lending rate cut in November  2014 was the first of its kind  since July 2012. The central  bank cut one-year benchmark  lending and deposit rates five  times in 2015 to the current  4.35% and 1.5%, respectively.  The spread between the  mentioned lending and  deposit rates has been 285  base points since November  2014 (down from 300 base  points). We would not be  surprised to see this spread  tightening even further.  Despite recent  improvements in Chinese  economic data, we expect the  PBOC to continue cutting RRR  and interest rates to boost  spending and investments  onshore. The rate and RRR  cuts will increase money  supply and, therefore, demand  for Panda bonds as well as  interbank assets, all of which  will further lower onshore  yields, in our view.  Warut Promboon is chief rating   officer at Dagong Global Credit   Rating Ltd in Hong Kong  For Panda bonds, issued by  unknown issuers, a proper  credit rating is crucial for an  efficient allocation of capital.  The market opinion is that  Chinese credit ratings do not  provide sufficient credit- quality differentiation.   A domestic rating of AAA  accounts for an issuer s  systemic importance to the  Chinese economy, which leads  to government support, in  our judgement. The domestic  ratings are also derived from  rankings among Chinese  peers, not international peers.  The abundance of domestic  AAA ratings has made it  difficult for investors to price  Panda bonds without doing  their own credit homework.  Arguably, many Panda bonds  rated AAA by Chinese credit  rating agencies will have  very different international  ratings. That said, we believe  a Panda bond rating should  be accompanied by an  international issuer rating.  A lack of a proper  international rating scale  attached to the Panda bond  rating could lead to investors    inability to assess credit  risk properly and that could  lead to credit losses and/or  insufficient capital cushions.  In other words, issuers may  not necessarily get to borrow  at a funding cost that reflects  their credit risk. We admit that  it is a challenge for Chinese  credit rating agencies to adjust  their rating scales, but bond  investors need the ability to  convert a Panda bond rating  into an international scale  in order to compare among  international peers.

Even among the  EU countries (whose existing  privacy laws all stem from a  common source   Directive  95/46/EC) national privacy  compliance obligations vary  significantly. Data-transfer  restrictions are much tighter  in Germany than in the  UK. Data processors need  to register with the local  Data Protection Authority  in Ireland, but not in Spain.  Levels of fines for the same  infringement may soon be   an order of magnitude higher  in France than in any other  EU country. The relevant  privacy laws in the UK only  apply to information about  living persons, but equivalent  laws elsewhere in the EU can   all. Of those countries that  do have such laws, some  (notably the US and Canada)  take a  sectoral  approach,  imposing privacy compliance  obligations on businesses,  based on the nature of their  activities. Other countries  (notably in the EU, and  increasingly in Asia and   Latin America) adopt  an  omnibus  approach,  imposing essentially the  same privacy compliance  obligations on all businesses,  regardless of their size or the  sector in which they operate.   This has meant that  international businesses  frequently face inconsistent  privacy compliance  obligations from one country   extend to deceased persons as  well. And so on.  A new sewing kit The EU institutions, to their  credit, have recognised that  this patchwork of similar,   but not identical, compliance  requirements across the   EU is unhelpful to anyone  who is trying to do business  across Europe. In response   to this, and a number of other  problems, legislators in the  EU published a new law,  entitled Regulation 2016/679  (the General Data Protection  Regulation or GDPR), on   4 May 2016.   It is difficult to overstate  the significance of the GDPR  from a business perspective.   Legal systems around   the world take different  approaches to the   question of how best to  balance the right to privacy  with the needs of a modern  economy. On the one hand,  individuals generally want  (and vote for) strong  protection of their own  privacy. On the other hand,  allowing businesses to  lawfully use certain  information about individuals  is increasingly important   to global commerce. Striking  a fair balance between   these competing interests   is not an intuitive or  straightforward process.  Many countries have no  strong laws in this area at   THE ABILITY TO COLLECT, STORE AND SHARE INFORMATION ON INDIVIDUALS  HAS NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT TO BUSINESSES, BUT A PATCHWORK    OF PRIVACY RULES MAKES FOR A SIGNIFICANT COMPLIANCE BURDEN.

Under  the GDPR, the obligations   are many, and they can be  quite technical in nature.  Selected examples of  particularly important  obligations include:  Record keeping     All businesses that are  subject to the GDPR  will be required to keep  detailed records of the  ways in which they (and  their subcontractors)  use information about  individuals. This is not   a simple task. It requires   a thorough understanding   of a business s day-to-day  operations, and regular  reviews to ensure that new  business developments and  processes are reflected in  the records.  Appointing a data- protection officer    Businesses that regularly  and systematically monitor  individuals, or process  sensitive information  about individuals on a  large scale, must appoint  a data-protection officer,  who is responsible for  data-protection compliance  by the relevant business  in the EU. A single data- protection officer can   be appointed for an entire  corporate group, but it   is essential to ensure that  that person has sufficient  powers and resources to  fulfil his or her duties.   Seventy-two-hour data  breach reporting   The  GDPR requires businesses  to report data breaches  to the relevant Data  Protection Authority within  72 hours of detection    an extremely short  period of time. The key   within the EU. Most  significantly, the legal form  that the GDPR takes is known  as a  regulation . This means  that, from the date on which  enforcement begins, the  GDPR will take effect in each  EU country, without the need  for national interpretation.  The same black-letter law  will apply in all 28 EU  countries. In theory, this will  drastically reduce the number  of inconsistent privacy  compliance obligations that  businesses face across the EU.  But there remains a  significant risk that different  national Data Protection  Authorities might take their  own slant on the GDPR,   interpreting the black-letter  law in light of their own views  of how businesses should  be regulated, and how the  right to privacy should be  protected. To address this  risk, the GDPR creates a legal  mechanism (known as the   consistency mechanism ),  which is designed to ensure  that Data Protection  Authorities all interpret the  law in a consistent manner.  However, it must be  acknowledged that the  GDPR will not achieve  complete harmonisation of  privacy laws across the EU.  Businesses will continue to  face inconsistencies in their  privacy obligations from  one EU country to the next,  because national variations  will inevitably persist in some  areas. But, there is genuine  optimism that the GDPR will  mean that businesses face a  significantly more consistent  set of privacy compliance  obligations across the EU.  What should businesses  do now? Having a consistent set  of privacy compliance   It is extraordinarily wide- ranging   the rules set out in  the GDPR will directly impact  every business based in the  EU, as well as every business  that operates in the EU, even  those based abroad. The  GDPR is extremely serious    it dramatically increases  the maximum fines to the  greater of €20m, or 4% of  annual worldwide turnover.  These figures are deliberately  intended to attract board- level attention.   Although the UK is set to  leave the EU, it is unlikely that  the negotiations of the UK s  departure will be completed  before enforcement of the  GDPR begins on 25 May  2018. Whether the GDPR will  continue to apply in the UK  after the conclusion of the  negotiations remains unclear  at this stage.  Perhaps the most  ambitious change that the  GDPR seeks to achieve is  the harmonisation of the  data-protection laws of all  countries in the EU.   This is no small challenge.  First, each country in the   EU has its own legal tradition  regarding the right to privacy,  and national courts with their  own case law and precedents  on privacy-related issues.  Second, each EU country  has its own Data Protection  Authority, which has its  own views on the ways that  businesses should be regulated  in relation to the use of  information about individuals.  Third, the EU institutions do  not have the power to pass  laws in all areas that affect  privacy. For example, the EU  cannot pass laws regarding  employment, national security  or freedom of speech   all of  which directly intersect with  the right to privacy.   Towards a less   patchy patchwork To address these challenges,  the GDPR introduces several  tools designed to increase  the degree of harmonisation   Dr Detlev Gabel (left) is a partner in White  & Case s Frankfurt office. He specialises in  data-protection and technology law  Tim Hickman (right) is a partner in the firm s  UK office and advises on all aspects of UK  and EU privacy and data-protection law  to meeting this deadline  is a decisive allocation of  responsibilities, and clear  lines of communication.  In practice, the person  most likely to discover  the breach (usually an IT  technician), the person  to whom it should be  reported (usually a member  of the legal team), and  the person who will make  strategic decisions (usually  a manager or board  member) rarely interact  in their ordinary duties.  Consequently, it is essential  for businesses to ensure  that these individuals are  used to working together  and that they each   understand their respective  roles and responsibilities,  in order to meet this   72-hour deadline.   These examples are  illustrative of the significant  changes that businesses  may need to make, both  organisationally and  operationally, in order to  comply with the GDPR. As  enforcement of the GDPR will  not begin until 25 May 2018,  businesses have a limited  window in which to prepare  for its impact. It is vital for  businesses to ensure that they  have set aside enough time,  and a sufficient budget, to  achieve the necessary changes  within this deadline.   Although the UK is set to leave the EU, it is unlikely   that the negotiations of the UK s departure will be  completed before enforcement of the GDPR begins    36  The Treasurer July/August 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Ethics and corporate governance Ethics  What are conflicts of  interest? While there are  several formal definitions,  such conflict occurs when  circumstances create the  risk that an individual s  judgements or actions are  impaired or influenced as   a result of other interests,   or considerations. Invariably,  such conflicts involve the  exploitation of a role or  position for personal, familial,   related-party or similar gain    a gain that can be financial,  favour or other form of benefit.  Clearly, a conflict of   interest can range widely in  severity, and can be actual  or perceived, but just the  perception alone can be  damaging, as it goes to the  very heart of an organisation s  corporate governance.   The corporate shield As the examples above show,  conflicts of interest can  represent a very significant  issue for organisations,  embracing the kind of activity  that any organisation should  be trying to avoid, ranging from  fraud, bribery, crime and price  fixing right through to ethics,  bias, nepotism, discrimination,  reputational damage and  questions of integrity.  Moreover, major organisations  and public bodies can also  face a legal challenge over  decisions, including contract  awards. Often, such conflicts  can have long-term and  wide-ranging consequences,  particularly where the conflict  has resulted in the choice of a  poorly performing or relatively   costly supplier.  However, despite these  issues, organisations   that  may have an otherwise  generally effective compliance  programme   often find  conflicts of interest simply  too challenging an area. This  can have the direct result  that their conflicts of interest  activities are virtually non- existent, notional, ineffective  or inconsistently applied.   In recent years, most  organisations have invested   IK O  N  IM  A G  ES  management services   was awarded to a supplier  without any justification.   It subsequently came to light  that the manager knew the  supplier who was awarded  the contract well. Both  were involved in another  company together. Clearly,  the manager should have had  no involvement in awarding  the contract, but made no  declarations of a conflict.  Examples of conflicts of  interest in business are   far from hard to find. In   one example, an investigation  highlighted that a COO had  engaged his wife to undertake  a human resources review   and subsequently made  payments to a company owned  by his wife, of which he was  the company secretary.  Payments over two years  totalled nearly £100,000.   There was no conflicts of  interest system, no clear  procurement controls and  totally inadequate separation  of duties. The payments were  also not disclosed as a related- party transaction.  The issue of employing  relatives comes up repeatedly  when looking for potential  conflicts. Take, for example,  the case of the senior manager  who employed his wife and  also his daughter, son and   the former finance officer s  son. The senior manager s  daughter was engaged as a  consultant for 11 months at   a cost of nearly £56,000, yet  this figure was not declared   in the accounts as a related- party transaction. Investigators  were subsequently told that   it was apparently not clear  from the guidance what  constituted a  close relative      the trigger for a declaration.  The senior manager s son   was employed for five months  and paid around £19,000,  and his wife was paid £6,000  for consultancy. The senior  manager resigned and   became the subject of   a police investigation.

This type of approach  enables a clear focus to be  initially established on the  highest conflict of interest  risks   typically, in senior  management, procurement  and in-country managers    before extending the process   further. However, simple  analysis of likely annual  turnover in employees, roles,  responsibilities, reporting  arrangements and personal  or professional relationships  indicates that keeping the  conflicts of interest system  up to date is inevitably very  challenging, particularly when  the full  request-reminder- escalation-feedback-decision   cycle involved in managing  conflicts of interest is taken  into account.  It is here that, increasingly,  conflicts of interest   are a key element of their  overall compliance and ethics  programme, but discover that  the practicalities of managing  conflict of interest day to day  can be challenging.  There is an argument that  conflicts of interest disclosure  programmes can go too far and  have unforeseen consequences.  One example I have come  across occurred within an   organisation of 150,000 people.  What came to light in this  example was a single mother  with three children working  part-time in a local burger  bar for additional cash, who  became hugely distressed    understandably   at the  prospect of disclosure leading  to the loss of her second (but  very low-risk) occupation     one on which she depended.  Clearly, this was not  the intended result of the  disclosure programme and it  is an incident that ultimately  resulted in a rethink and a   heavily in their anti-bribery  and corruption programmes.  However, it could be argued  that such investment is largely  in direct response to legislative  developments, such as the UK  Bribery Act, Foreign Corrupt  Practices Act and similar  statutes, which, although  differing in detail, have very  similar core requirements.  Arguably, the situation is  different when it comes to  conflicts of interest. Some  countries, such as the US,  adopt a generally rules-based  approach to conflicts of  interest, some, such as the UK,  take a broadly principles-based  approach and others take  no specific approach, or an  approach that is a by-product  of other legislation.  Whatever the approach,  the direct legislative drive  for a conflicts of interest  programme is variable,  with the consequence that  organisations often expose  themselves to completely  unnecessary risk, by failing  to realise the benefits  of an effective conflicts  of interest programme.  Without question, this is a  crucial element of an overall  compliance programme and,  when properly joined up with  other compliance activities,  represents an effective  compliance corporate shield.  As the examples above  have already shown, there  is invariably a link between  conflicts of interest and  corruption, in all its  types. However good an  organisation s anti-bribery  and corruption programme,  without a comparably  effective conflicts of interest  programme, the organisation  will, without doubt, be  exposed.

Challenge and  opportunity Many organisations recognise  that conflicts of interest   Keith Read is  an independent  compliance consultant  There is invariably a link between  conflicts of interest and corruption  management systems are coming  into their own. Crucially, these  systems are straightforward  and non-threatening, which  makes it easy for employees to  be thorough and forthcoming in  their relationship disclosures. As  key employees  roles, reporting  lines and relationships change,  disclosures can be requested  automatically, quickly updated  and automatically flagged  should clearance need to change.  This significantly reduces  the administrative burden of  redundant disclosures and  minimises the time and effort  required of employees. This  in turn leads to more high- quality disclosures containing  fuller genuine information, in  a relatively simple and easy-to- understand format.   This data can then, crucially,  be linked with an organisation s  compliance reporting, whistle- blower hotline and training  systems, and core HR data to  create an effective reporting  tool with visibility of the wider  picture on conflicts, and potential  misconduct. Linked to effective  compliance communications,  managing conflicts of interest  then moves from  chore  to  essential tool in the corporate  governance armoury   such   that employees are alert to   the potential for a perceived   or actual conflict.  But how far would you  go? It is generally relatively  straightforward within local  laws to identify companies  and directorships registered to  individuals, and then compare  that to their conflicts of interest  disclosure, if they have made  one.

It is also significant in terms   of concerns about systemic  risk in the financial sector   and, more recently, the  prospect of the introduction  of the financial transactions  tax (FTT).   The FTT has generated  widespread concern among  financial institutions and the  corporate sector. Derivatives  markets are predicted to  bear a high burden of the  FTT. According to a PwC  literature review on the FTT1,  the increase in direct costs on  derivative transactions as a  result could be in the region of  18 times the bid/offer spread  in normal market conditions.   The PwC review points to  the European Commission s  impact assessment of the  FTT, which estimated that  the tax would reduce volume  in the derivatives market  by between 70% and 90%,  resulting in a significant hike  in costs. This is anticipated  to have an impact on the risk  management capabilities of  the corporate sector, as well as  that of financial institutions.  For example, the PwC report  predicts an annual cost of  €1-3bn to EU corporates for  FX and interest rate (IR) risk  management, and suggests  that the taxation of intragroup  derivative transactions for  hedging could generate a  significant negative impact   on the economics of corporate  risk management.   In attempting to discourage  socially undesirable  transactions, such as excessive  risk taking, the FTT may  inadvertently also adversely  affect more desirable  activities, such as hedging.  We believe that the FTT in  relation to corporate derivative  transactions will be necessary  only if it can be shown that   the corporate use of derivative  instruments gives rise to  systemic risk. We argue that   it will only do so if non- financial firms are using  derivatives for speculation.   This question is important  in a UK setting, compared  with, say, the US. As  previously pointed out   (The Treasurer, May 2016, page  48), the bankruptcy code in  the UK is considered to be  creditor friendly, which makes  the likelihood of a UK firm  falling into administration  and, ultimately, liquidation,  much greater than that faced  by US firms. This would imply  that UK firms have a greater  incentive to mitigate the  effects of financial distress and  that should manifest itself in  the form of a strong negative  (inverse) relationship between  derivatives use and measures  of the likelihood of firm  financial distress.   Derivative users Data on UK firms  use  of financial derivative  instruments is hand-collected  from annual reports of all the  non-financial firms in the top  500 of London Stock Exchange  listed firms. A firm is classified  as a derivative user if it  discloses in its annual report  that it uses foreign currency  (FC), IR or commodity price  (CP) derivatives. Over our  sample period, 74% of firms  disclosed that they used FC  derivatives, 71% indicated that  they used IR derivatives and  10% were using CP derivatives.  A forward contract was the  most popular FC derivative,  employed by 62% of firms,  followed by FC swaps, which  were used by 32% of firms,  and then FC options, used   by 10% of firms. Among firms  using IR derivatives, IR swaps  were the most popular, used  by 58% of firms, followed  by forward-rate agreements  employed by 33% of firms and,  finally, IR caps or collars were  utilised by 11% of firms.  Firms in our sample have  relatively high levels of foreign     TAXATION  OPERATING COSTS   www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer July/August 2016 The Treasurer  39  Default probabilities In the graph we plot the  estimated yearly derivative  coefficients obtained from  running the aforementioned  regression model. A negative  (positive) value indicates that  derivative users had lower  (higher) default probabilities  than non-users after  controlling for the impact   of other factors. The graph  shows significant variation  over time in the effect of  derivatives on the probability  of default. It is noticeable  that the effect of derivatives  is highly negative in the years  2000-2001 and the period  2007-2009, and positive  during the years 2004-2006.   This variation in the  impact of derivatives on  the probability of default  seems to be consistent with  the macroeconomic and  financial risk environment  prevailing during these  periods. In other words, our  results show that the negative  impact of derivatives use on  the probability of default is  greater during unfavourable  macroeconomic and financial  or credit risk conditions,  leading to a larger negative  value for our derivatives  coefficient at this time.  This finding suggests that  derivative users are more  resilient or perhaps hedge  more intensively during  periods of economic and  financial downturn.   Conversely, during relatively  benign credit risk conditions,   economic and financial  uncertainty have a greater  impact on firms that do not  use derivatives relative to   firms that do.   One statistical drawback   of this analysis is that it fails   to control for other firm-  level differences between   users and non-users, a factor  that could be driving these  results. To overcome this  shortcoming, we run   a multivariate regression  model, which controls for  several firm-specific factors  that might also have an    impact on firm-default  probabilities, such as leverage,  profitability, liquidity, firm  size, equity return volatility  and a firm s stock market  return. We also interact  our derivatives use variable  with year dummies, which  allows the coefficient on the  derivatives use dummy in our  regression equation to vary   by year. In essence, we  estimate the effect of  derivatives on the probability  of default separately for each  year of our sample period in  order to investigate whether  the impact of derivatives use  varies over time.   sales, with the mean and  median values of foreign sales  close to 60%. In comparison,  US firms in the S&P 500 have,  on average, around 20% of  foreign sales with a median  value of only about 12.5%,  which suggests that UK firms  possess on average much  higher levels of FC exposure  than their US counterparts.  These exposure characteristics  support our assertion that   the UK is a good setting   for examining the effects   of derivatives on firm   default probabilities.  We begin our analysis by  examining the time-series  variation in the probability of  default for all-derivative users  and non-users for the period  1999 to 2010.   The graph above shows  that the difference in default  probabilities between  derivative users and non-users  reached its maximum at the  end of 2008, at the height  of the financial crisis. The  previous maximum difference  between derivative users  and non-users was during  the economic slowdown of  2002, which seems to suggest  that periods of heightened   Dr Amrit Judge is associate  professor in finance at  Nottingham University  Business School  Vikram Finavker is   a lecturer in finance   at Birmingham   City University  such as those witnessed  between, say, 2004-2006, our  results indicate that derivative  users had slightly higher  default probabilities than  non-user firms. This finding is  consistent with the notion that  derivative users were perhaps  hedging less of their exposures  during these years by way of   a selective hedging strategy.   For the overwhelming  majority of firms in our  sample, disclosures in annual  reports suggest that firms are  using financial derivatives for  hedging, that is, risk reduction.  Our empirical results are  consistent with this as they  show derivative use lowers  firms  default probabilities.  This, in turn, should lower the  credit risk faced by lenders  and consequently lower the  credit risk premiums charged  to borrowers, which implies a  clear economic benefit arising  from the use of derivatives  by corporates. Furthermore,  our findings indicate an  interesting time variation  in the effect of derivatives  on the probability of default  in that the impact seems to  be greater during periods of  macroeconomic and financial  markets uncertainty.   In conclusion, we believe  that our evidence provides  support for the argument  that corporate derivative  transactions should be exempt  from the FTT and that public  policymakers should be  facilitating and encouraging  corporate risk management  with derivatives and not   the opposite.

LEE McDARBY DISCUSSES HOW ELECTION FEVER COULD IMPACT THE DOLLAR  in the run-up to polling day  on 8 November. Whether the  Democratic Party retains the  presidency   presumably with  Hillary Clinton at the helm    or are pipped to the post by  the somewhat divisive Donald  Trump, the appointment   of America s 45th president  could significantly impact   the US dollar s performance  later this year.  Before we contemplate   the dollar s post-election  future through analysing   the precedent set by previous  presidential battles in   recent history, we should   analyse how it has been  performing so far in 2016,  and consider how the official  campaign period might  influence its fortunes in   the coming months.  With the election still just  a dot on the horizon, other  more immediate factors held  sway over dollar sentiment in  Q1 2016. Having strengthened  on the whole against sterling    due largely to uncertainty  surrounding the UK s  referendum vote on its EU  membership   the dollar was  checked by further downbeat  data emanating from China,   confirming the  fact that the  world s second-  largest economy  remains sluggish.  Not to mention, the   proverbial icing on the  cake of negative sentiment,   a renewed slide in commodity  prices. This prompted the US  Federal Reserve (the Fed) to  adopt a more cautious stance  in relation to its appetite  for further interest-rate  increases, after hiking them  back in December for the first  time since 2006. Such dovish  tones from the central bank  triggered quarterly losses of  around 4% against a basket   of currencies.  Since then, however,   not only have expectations   of fresh US rate hikes   gained traction thanks   to improved domestic  economic conditions    after a Q1 lull, developments  in the presidential election  have begun to focus   market attention.   With Donald Trump  already confirmed as the  Republican presumptive  nominee   inching ever  closer to clinching the party s  official nomination for  president after his remaining  rivals dropped out of the  race   and Hillary Clinton on  track to reach the required  number of delegates from  the primaries to win the  Democratic nomination,  the ensuing political and  economic instability bring  uncertainty that could weigh  on the dollar in the coming  weeks and months. According  to several major financial  institutions, the dollar could  become vulnerable to political  rhetoric as both heavyweight  nominees trade punches  in what could be an open- ended presidential campaign;  just as the British pound  trended downwards after the  UK announced it would be  holding its EU referendum.  Historical evidence  demonstrates how politics  and economics make for  intimate bedfellows. The  effects of the former on  the latter are significant,  particularly when the prize   is the Oval Office. Prior to   the last US presidential  election in 2012, the dollar  weakened from $1.53 against  the pound in mid-January   40  The Treasurer July/August 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer    demonstrated by the  upcoming US presidential  election. This is largely  because investors are likely  to take flight from the  dollar during the campaign  period and in the immediate  aftermath of the vote,  in favour of more stable  countries with a relatively  strong economic   performance in which to  invest their capital.   As 8 November draws  closer, the prospect of  increased dollar volatility  will pose different challenges  for treasurers of companies  that trade internationally,  depending on the nature of  their international payment  requirements. For UK  businesses that export to the  US, this period of anticipated  dollar vulnerability could  have an adverse effect on  their cash flows, as  the cost of their FX  exposure escalates.   As a value-added  service for SMEs  and corporations  alike in terms of  the management  and execution of FX  and international  payments, an FX expert  would help businesses  mitigate the risks posed  by market movements  through the development  and implementation  of effective FX hedging  strategies in line with trading  activities. Having taken   the time to understand   a business s requirements,   an FX expert will monitor   the currency markets on their  behalf, providing specialist  guidance around the driving  forces influencing their  state   facilitating informed   the control of a Democratic  government since 2009.  If, as headlines suggest,  a Trump win engenders  a radical shift in policies    including a foreign- policy direction that could  potentially isolate the US  from its trading partners and  have an effect on exports, the  resulting market uncertainty  regarding its potential impact  on the US economy could  precipitate exaggerated short- term dollar weakness.  Whether Trump comes up  trumps in November or not,  it is reasonable to expect that  the dollar will experience   an initial drop in value   to some extent. However,   recent history suggests it   will recover shortly after some  semblance of political and  economic stability is restored.  For example, when George  W Bush was elected into  his first term as president,  the greenback strengthened  against sterling from an  average of 1.5150 in 2000 to  1.4500 in 2001. Even more  notably, when Barack Obama  was first elected, the dollar  strengthened from an average  of 1.8120 in 2008 to 1.5625 in  2009 versus the sterling.   Managing market  volatility The fluid nature of the FX  market and its sensitivity  to various political and  economic events will be   to $1.63 in September, with  opinion polls predicting the  vote as too close to call. At  the time, these would have  been extremely beneficial  conditions if your UK-based  business was importing goods  or services from the US during  this period. For example, at  the less favourable January  rate, $300,000 worth of stock  from your US supplier would  have cost £196,000, whereas   at the September rate the  price would have dropped   to £184,000. That constitutes   a saving of £12,000 between  the high and low points,  simply due to fluctuating  exchange rates.  Impact post-election While we don t yet know   who will be sworn in as  the next US president on  20 January, it goes without  saying that whomever comes  out on top   Republican or  Democrat   the result may  well have a significant impact  on the US dollar and the  financial markets.   The Fed may control the  nation s monetary policy,  but decisions made and  policies implemented by  the new president will exert  considerable influence over  the dollar. If Clinton clinches  the election, the impact could  be less volatile to the climate  of political policy than if  Trump seizes power, given that  the country has been under   The fluid nature of the FX market  and its sensitivity to various  political and economic events  will be demonstrated by the  upcoming US presidential election  decisions around the  optimum timing of transfers.

For a moment, networking  seemed destined for the  business back-burner.  The context? On no less  a stage than the World   Behavioural skills Influencing  While recognising the   value of high-profile Davos- type events, which offer  unrivalled opportunity for  face-to-face contact with  influential business people,  Stromback commented:   Ninety-nine per cent of  Davos is information or  experience you can get  elsewhere, on your own  timeframe and in a more  comfortable manner.”  Economic Forum, networking  supremo, venture capitalist  and entrepreneur Rich  Stromback (also known  as Mr Davos) was said to  have uttered a damning  indictment of networking,  when he argued that our  attempts to connect with our  fellow man and woman are,  mostly, all for nought.  But what Stromback actually  said deserves closer analysis.  Equally enlightening was  his response to a question  on whether connecting  with influencers represents  valuable, real work:  The  answer is to be extremely  efficient and focus on what   is truly essential,” he said.  So, how can we increase   our networking efficiency and  at the same time be open to  new methods of connecting  for business purposes?  Think before  you mingle IS NETWORKING WORTH YOUR TIME? ONLY IF YOU PLAN, STRATEGISE  AND HONE YOUR APPROACH. DARRYL HOWES EXPLAINS  IK O  N  IM  A G  ES    Strategic networking Networks can take many  forms. Heavyweight  computing power, coupled  with the recent availability  of massive social media data  sets, show that we are only  just beginning to understand  how they operate.  Herminia Ibarra, professor  of organisational behaviour  at INSEAD Business School,  categorises networks  under three headings. The  first is operational: those  relationships required to get  our work done. The second is  personal, for example, through  membership of exclusive  groups or affiliations.  However, according to  Ibarra, it is only strategic  networks, the third and by far  the most important type, that  can plug the individual into a  source of collaborative power  that can help drive both  individual and organisational  goals. Ibarra defines strategic  networking as:  the ability  to marshall information,  support and resources from  one sector of a network to  achieve results in another”.  Since the 1970s, it s  been known that exclusive  networks, ie those based on  traditional social groupings  such as school, university   or workplace, do not help  if we are looking for fresh  thinking and inspiration.  Stanford social psychologist  Mark Granovetter established  that  weak tie  alliances were  far better for developing  truly useful collaboration.  In a modern-knowledge  economy, it s easy to see how  the  social superglue  of the  former can be usurped by the  latter, a form of intellectually  lubricating social WD40.  Furthermore, today s time- poor work environment might  require us to adopt a new  approach to our networking   www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer July/August 2016 The Treasurer  43  An altogether different  approach allows us to find  the right kind of contacts  using LinkedIn and, where  appropriate, orchestrate  mutually beneficial  introductions via our first- or  second-degree connections.  This way, building a network  becomes less about chance  meetings and more about  coordinated strategy.  After making a  connection, the   online small talk  aspect can be  very helpful,  through steady  but non-intrusive   communication   of information    that may be useful to  a new contact   whether that  takes the form of sharing  articles, discussion points,  general commentary or  technical matter.  This is most definitely not  spam; the language should  be personal and social in  nature (it is social media after  all) and this practice can be  supplemented by LinkedIn s  diary features, which  highlight work anniversaries,  personal events, LinkedIn  posts and so on, providing  users with a reason and  opportunity to reach out.  The communication  pathway can be extended  further to email or perhaps  other forms of social media,  such as Twitter. From there,  it is a short step to a personal  meeting, which is likely   to be the key secondary  objective. Only here will   the conversation be opened  out to determine what   advice and guidance can  be sought. This might be  in the form of industry  trends, insights or specific  assignments that can provide  a strategic advantage for   the networker.  Darryl Howes is  a learning and  development consultant  at DDNS Consulting Ltd  Opportunities  It s for all of us to decide  on a networking strategy  that works according to the  resources available to us. But  it must be time to consider  using a blended range of  methods in a more focused  and less hit-and-miss fashion.  Social media provides  us with new tools and  opportunities. If we are  to take full advantage of  these, we need to consider  our network structures and  whether we should break out  from the exclusive alliances  that might restrict our  thinking and blind us from   a wider range of possibilities.  The final word should go  to Stromback:  I need to  be selective, yet authentic;  focused, yet open to  possibilities. Opportunities  do not float like clouds in   the sky. They are attached   to people.”  Networking is a social  activity, but that doesn t   mean it can t be strategic.   practices. If we don t, we  can spend valuable time  attending events and building  alliances that fail to deliver on  our needs. In effect, we ll end  up doing the right things, but  in the wrong way.  Our start point should  therefore be to decide  exactly what we want from  our networking. How much  resource, including time  commitment, do we  have available to  devote to it?  What tangible  outcomes are  we seeking to  achieve, and is  our normal default  mode of connecting  with people serving us  in the best way?  Disruptive power  The 24/7 digitally connected  and disrupted world means  we don t have to behave in  the same old ways. On the  other hand, we cannot sell  ourselves (for that is what   we are doing) entirely online.   Traditional face-to-face  networking always involves   a form of honeymoon period.  Both parties engage in   small talk, get to know   each other and build   trust. This is a necessary   precursor before moving  to the separate context of  a more formal exchange of  business needs, for example,  securing that sought-after  introduction to a new client  or finding a mentor for   career development.  But the investment in time  required to seek out, research  and attend events can prove  prohibitive. This is especially  so when event organisers are  understandably guarded over  attendee data and there is no  guarantee of the person you  want to meet actually being   at a given event.  Traditional face-to-face networking always  involves a form of honeymoon period  GRANOVETTER S  WEAK TIES  In a series of experiments designed  to understand how people improve  their employment prospects, Stanford  social psychologist Mark Granovetter  interviewed job-seeking participants.   He established that, while strong  ties breed local social cohesion, they  also lead to wider fragmentation.  Granovetter claims that a more effective  and perhaps more agile networking  strategy is to nurture weak ties across,  within and beyond our normal close  associations. The paradox is that weak  ties actually further the integration  of individuals among disparate social  groups. In short, Granovetter says   that weak ties are  indispensable   to individuals  opportunities”.

Arbitrage adder By contrast, chasing arbitrage profits is usually dangerous folly.  Arbitrage is very important to define carefully and understand.  Temporary and risk-free  Arbitrage means dealing simultaneously in multiple markets, to  exploit a temporary discrepancy in prices, and earn a risk-free profit.  Notice the arbitrage opportunity is both (i) temporary and (ii)   risk-free.  No free lunch When markets are efficient, any short-term discrepancies in prices,  giving rise to temporary arbitrage opportunities, are eliminated by  the market mechanism.  Market mechanism  Parity  Arbitrage  Market mechanism  The resulting market condition of  parity  is known as the    no-arbitrage  pricing relationship. At the parity prices, there are   no longer any arbitrage opportunities. Benefits and costs are equal.   This is the  no free lunch  principle.

We d start the deal by borrowing currency C at 1%, and convert it  to currency D at the spot FX rate.   We d simultaneously deposit currency D, to earn the attractive rate  of 3%.  At maturity, we need to re-exchange the currencies. To avoid FX  risk, we d need to pre-agree a forward FX rate for the re-exchange.  If the market would ever give us a forward contract to re-exchange  at the same FX rate as we enjoyed at the start, we could indeed be  better off by the interest rate difference of 3%   1% = 2%.  Sting in the tail But the market will never do that for us.  Market prices will normally already have adjusted, via the market  mechanism, to eliminate any opportunity for risk-free gains by doing  these types of  round trip  deals.  There ll be an adverse difference between the spot and forward FX  rates, resulting in an FX loss. Under parity, we lose exactly as much  on the FX difference as we gain on the interest rates.

Confirm your understanding by answering this  recent exam question.   New colleague Your new colleague has heard you mention arbitrage and interest  rate parity, but does not understand what these terms mean.   Explain the relationship between arbitrage and interest rate parity. Certificate in Treasury, specimen Q23(a), extracts  Outline answer Arbitrage means dealing simultaneously in related markets whose  prices are misaligned, to take advantage of a temporary discrepancy  in prices.  Parity is the situation where prices are consistent. Under parity,  there are no such risk-free profit (arbitrage) opportunities.  Interest rate parity (IRP) is the expected  no-arbitrage  price  relationship between the interest rates in two currencies, and the  spot and forward FX rates.  Assuming more marks and more time, we would write more. The  following points would deepen and broaden the explanation for our  new colleague.  In practice Most arbitrage opportunities are short lived and small, because the  market mechanism acts very quickly to realign market prices.  If IRP did not hold, a related arbitrage opportunity might be to:  (1)  borrow one currency cheaply;  (2) exchange it immediately for a second currency; (3)  deposit the second currency at a higher interest rate; and  (4)  re-exchange the currencies at a pre-agreed favourable    forward FX rate.  In practice, IRP  holds very strongly for  widely traded currencies,  because of the large volumes  and speed of dealing,  including arbitrage dealing.   Fictional profits Back in the office, hearing or seeing  the word  arbitrage  should alert us to  be cautious and ask questions.  Nick Leeson of the former Barings Bank created unauthorised  speculative positions, and misreported them as  arbitrage  to his  managers. Leeson concealed the losses on his speculations, and  reported fictional profits.   How to save a billion The reported profits were too good to be true. These fictional profits  were large, persistent and reportedly risk-free. But no real arbitrage  opportunity would have lasted that long.  Senior management didn t understand arbitrage well enough.  As a result, they didn t ask the right questions. Leeson s disastrous  speculations lost his employer well over $1bn, and led to Barings   failure in 1995.  My name is caution Leeson recently sounded this warning:   The message that my name brings is caution. You do need to  understand what you re doing, otherwise a lot of people blow up, and  blow up very quickly.”  Nick Leeson, 2016   Lessons to learn The official report into the failure of Barings included the   following lessons: (a) Management has a duty to fully understand the business    it manages. (b) Responsibilities have to be clearly established    and communicated. To fulfil our management responsibilities, we need to understand.  How to save $9bn Were these lessons from the Barings failure learned and applied? Evidently not.  Subsequent rogue trading activity resulted in even larger   losses, including: • Société Générale 2006-08: $7bn • UBS 2011: $2bn A total of $9bn for those two organisations alone.

He   was wandering through  Hampstead Heath, absent- mindedly brooding, deep in  thought, his brow furrowed.   We call communism the   real movement which  abolishes the present state   of things,” he said aloud to   no one in particular.   He seemed completely  oblivious of the moustached  comic striding stooped beside  him, his prominent eyebrows  raised as high as Karl s were  knitted together.  Politics is  the art of looking for trouble,  finding it everywhere,  diagnosing it incorrectly and  applying the wrong remedies,”  said Groucho Marx.   Karl looked to his strange  companion as though he had  never laid eyes on him before.  Which, of course, he hadn t.   A spectre is haunting Europe    the spectre of communism!”  he growled.   Well, whatever it is, I m  against it,” said Groucho.    I refuse to join any club that  would have me as a member.”   Money is the universal,  self-constituted value of all  things. Hence it has robbed  the whole world of its proper  value,” Karl said, his humour  not improving.   While money can t buy  happiness, it certainly lets  you choose your own form  of misery,” retorted Groucho.   Why, look at me. I worked my  way up from nothing to a state  of extreme poverty!”   Have you not read  Das Kapital?” asked Karl,  astonished and angry.  46  The Treasurer July/August 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer   Reason has always existed,  but not always in a reasonable  form,” muttered Karl, under  his breath.    Humour is reason gone  mad,” said Groucho, wagging  his finger and his eyebrows.   If you find it hard to laugh at  yourself, I would be happy to  do it for you.”   The question whether  objective truth can be  attributed to human thinking  is not a question of theory,  but is a practical question,”  exclaimed Karl.   Groucho was bewildered.   There s one way to find out   if a man is honest: ask him.   If he says  yes , you know he   is crooked,” he said.    It is not the consciousness  of men that determines  their being, but, on the  contrary, their social being    IN THIS  ISSUE:  MONTH END   From the moment I picked  your book up until I laid it  down, I was convulsed with  laughter. Someday I intend  reading it,” said Groucho.  This provoked Karl no  end. From his leather satchel  he produced a copy of The  Communist Manifesto.  Read  it!” he roared.   Groucho flicked through the  book, his fingers touching the  pages as though they might be  laced with arsenic.  This is not  a book that should be set aside  lightly,” Groucho concluded  a moment later.  It should be  flung with great force!”  Karl turned in fury. Before  he could speak, Groucho said:   Why, a four-year-old child  could understand this. Run  out and find me a four-year- old child. I can t make head  nor tail out of it.”  Karl Marx, author of The Communist Manifesto and  Das Kapital, died in 1883. Groucho Marx, comedian,   wit and raconteur, was born in 1890.

In some cases this meant sounding a warning note   as with economist John Kay s  argument that the behemoth that is modern-day capital markets regulation creates genuine risk  of another financial crisis.  But mostly, looking forward was a great deal less troubling, as with the panel discussions on  diversity and sustainability, which reminded participants and their audience that the hard work  we put in now on these issues will create stronger companies and institutions, as well as pay  dividends for future generations and for the workplaces of the future.  In the case of futurist Rohit Talwar, looking forward was entertaining. What with 3D printing,  advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, and vastly increased life expectancy,  treasurers and finance professionals have it within their gift to expect and encourage big steps  forward in efficiency gains and cost-effectiveness.   Meanwhile, a delegation of senior finance leaders from some of China s biggest companies  talked about their country s economic fortunes and prospects for deregulation. An overview of  some of the thought-provoking and challenging presentations begins on page 18.  Elsewhere in this issue, journalist Ben Poole talks to Steve Humphreys, head of group treasury  at fashion retailer New Look. Humphreys joined New Look back in 2011 at a time when the  company was poised for expansion. Under his direction, New Look has gone through two  significant rounds of fundraising: capital markets refinancing in 2013 that raised over £800m in  bonds, and another in 2015 that brought in £1.2bn and enabled the company to lower the cost of  debt by some 300 base points. Little wonder then that New Look took mid-sized business treasury  team of the year in The Treasurer s Deals of the Year Awards 2015. Turn to page 22 to find out more.

The findings of a report from  the Financial Conduct Authority  (FCA) suggest that both start-ups  and more mature SMEs are finding  themselves unable to secure services  from banks, as the banks themselves  seek to comply with the anti-money- laundering regime and combat the  finance of terrorism regulations.  The report, Drivers & Impacts  of Derisking, compiled by  consultants John Howell & Co,  found that companies in the  defence and fintech sectors have  been particularly affected amid  heightened concerns over illicit use  of the UK financial system.  The report highlighted the fact  that this problem is much more  prevalent in relation to smaller  companies than corporates, with  unknown or untested business  models   particularly among  fintech operations   tending to  attract a more cautious response  from banks.  The FCA has conducted an  extensive review of de-risking  trends and has acknowledged the   enormous frustration  that exists  within the business community.  However, it concluded that there  is no silver bullet that will mitigate  the problem.   The FCA has made several  recommendations as part of   the review.   The Bank of England and  Financial Services Act 2016  introduced a requirement for   the FCA to issue guidance on   the meaning of politically exposed  persons for the purposes of money- laundering regulations. The FCA  will work with HM Treasury to  deliver this requirement later   this year.  BRIEFING  06  The Treasurer June 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  { CONTEXT OF TREASURY }  TREASURERS REPORT RISE IN FRAUD The proportion of cases of  actual or attempted fraud   affecting corporate treasurers has  increased by 19% since last year,  according to a survey conducted   by financial cloud software  provider Kyriba with the ACT.  In this year s joint survey, 62%   of respondents said they had been  the targets of internal or external  fraud attempts, up substantially  from 43% recorded in last year s  survey. One fraud incident resulted  in a $2.5m loss.  While reports of fraud were  up, the report, Kyriba/ACT  2016 Treasury Survey, found  participants placing a relatively  low priority on fraud. The top   three improvement priorities    for the year ahead were reported   to be cash and liquidity  management, cash forecasting   and treasury automation.  The survey also provides further  evidence of the wider and more  strategic role that treasurers  play within their corporates.  The number of treasurers  taking responsibility for group  liquidity management, including  investment and borrowing, has  increased from 67% last year to  84% this year. More than half say  they are playing a more strategic  role within their organisation, with  30% providing counsel to the main  board and executive team.   However, treasurers also report  that regulatory and market   demands are prompting them   to spend more time on cash-flow  forecasting and compliance than  ever before. The survey reported  extensive use of spreadsheets  within corporates of up to $1bn   in turnover and black spots in   their cash visibility. Fewer than  60% of participants have visibility  over 80% of their global cash,  while more than a quarter, 28%,  have visibility of less than 60%   of forecast cash flow.  In this year s report, treasurers  said their top three activities were:  cash-flow forecasting followed  by risk management and bank  account management.   Download the report in full from  www.treasurers.org/node/303632   The extent  of the decline,  comparable to  what happened  around the time  of the so-called  Lehman shock,   is causing a major  blow to emerging- market economies  that depend  on exports of  commodities and  basic materials   for growth.” Shinzō Abe, Japan s prime  minister (pictured above), paints  a bleak picture of the world  economy, as he sought to delay  a hike in consumption tax in an  effort to minimise shocks to his  country s fragile recovery.  SOURCE: WALL STREET JOURNAL, 27 MAY 2016   In that scenario  we would expect a  material slowing in  growth, a notable  rise in inflation,   a challenging   trade-off. ”  Governor of the Bank of   England Mark Carney nails   his Brexit colours to the   mast in a press conference  following the quarterly inflation  report, arguing that a post- Brexit slowdown could result   in a recession.  SOURCE: THE INDEPENDENT, 13 MAY 2016  WORDS     { CONTEXT OF TREASURY }  Moody s says banks likely to benefit   from emerging fintech players  The role of banks in the financial  system is unlikely to be disturbed    by fintech operators, says ratings   agency Moody s.  With 4,000 fintech businesses  worldwide, according to Moody s  estimates, it is far more likely that  mainstream financial institutions  will learn from newcomers and their  innovations. In turn, those institutions  are likely to evolve into broader, full- service technology firms.  According to Moody s, fintech  operations have proved adept at  attracting skilled millennials, who are  looking for roles within organisations  with a more flexible approach to  financial services than those typically  provided by banks. However, once banks  acquire fintech operations or adopt  similar capabilities, they are likely to  be able to attract the same calibre of  candidates. What s more, they are likely  to have a competitive edge, given their  long track record, substantial customer  base and experience around complex  regulatory regimes.   Moody s senior vice president, Robard  Williams, said:  Millennials lag prior  generations along a number of indicators  important to financial services firms,  including lower household formation  and home-buying rates, higher student- loan burdens, lower earnings and  higher debt-to-income ratios. Banks will  certainly need to transform to appeal  to this generation and counter fintechs   rise, but many incumbents have made  significant steps towards implementing  their own digital strategies and they   have some time before the full  transformation is complete.”  In its analysis of the fintech scene,  Moody s has judged that most firms  are focused on retail-banking services    largely lending and financing   with  others launching innovative products  and services related to payments.  While those firms are credited for  showing growth and   in some cases    filling gaps that banks have vacated  because of post-crisis regulation,  Moody s considers a  major competitive  reversal” a long shot.  { NEWS FROM THE ACT }  New role for ACT s  engagement director From next month, Peter Matza, the  ACT s engagement director, will be focusing on   a reduced role as speakers  chair supporting ACT  events programmes and content development.

UBS was one of the worst  hit, with a one-off fall of  7.5% at the end of April.  Commerzbank saw its  shares fall by more than  9%.

Asian regulators call for  Panama Papers disclosures Hong Kong and Singapore  regulators have asked   banks that do business   in their territories to   reveal whether they have  dealings with organisations  and individuals who   have come to light via   the  Panama Papers    leaks. According to news  agency Reuters, the Hong  Kong Monetary Authority  and the Monetary  Authority of Singapore  wrote to banks in April,   but have not set a deadline  for response.   Leaked documents from  Panama law firm Mossack  Fonseca, containing  information on 214,000  offshore companies, suggest  that Hong Kong is the most  active centre globally for the  creation of shell firms.  Bankers operating in  Hong Kong told Reuters  that the Panama Papers  leak has triggered a huge  compliance exercise in   the locality.  OECD issues low-  growth warning The Organisation for  Economic Co-operation  and Development (OECD)  has warned that the global  economy is set to continue  at its slowest pace since  the financial crisis for the  second year in a row.   The OECD has urged  governments to increase  their spending, as the world  economy is forecast to  grow by only 3% this year.  In its biannual Economic  Outlook, the OECD said  policymakers had to act to  break world economies out  of the low-growth trap.  INTERNATIONAL BRIEFING  { TREASURY OPERATIONS }  SMALL ENTITIES  HITTING FX AND  CASH CHALLENGES  Greater numbers of internationally  focused small corporates, or micro-  multinationals, are facing cross-border  liquidity management issues early in  their business life cycle, according to   an HSBC report.  The report, The Rise of the Micro- Multinationals, says a growing number  of mid-sized companies are proving  increasingly able to take advantage of  growth outside their domestic markets.   In the UK, 40% of these companies  have opened offices in new markets in  the past five years, one of the highest  rates of international expansion in the  world, according to a study by FedEx  Express. This trend is set to continue,  HSBC s report argues, with 83% of small  to mid-sized businesses citing overseas  expansion as their top priority.   Micro-multinationals show a  willingness to innovate and address  export markets. However, they often  lack the scale to be attractive to finance  and technology suppliers.    Really forward-minded businesses  are benefiting from an interconnected  world,” says Amanda Murphy, UK  head of corporate banking at HSBC.   However, they can suffer from the  middle-child syndrome   not as  influential as the big brands, so not  able to break into government export  financing, but not small enough to  receive political attention and the  support that tends to go with this.”  These companies are also challenged  by the potential complexity of their  financial and treasury technology  needs. Managing exposures to multiple  currencies and addressing working  capital issues are significant issues for  the smaller corporate, but implementing  treasury management systems (TMSs)  across markets can be expensive for  smaller operations.

The code, which  encourages the sharing  of clear and accurate  information and the setting  up of robust governance  around FX trading, has   been welcomed by central  bank governors, regional   FX committees and   market participants.  James Kemp, MD of the  Global Financial Markets  Association s global FX  division, said:  This is an  opportunity for global   market participants to  demonstrate that they can  put the right controls and  guidance in place that are  consistent with the principles  of the code. We believe the  introduction of a single  code will create a common  reference point to encourage  good practice and rebuild  public confidence that   the FX industry   which  underpins global trade and  investment   is functioning  fairly and effectively.”  Chairman of the BIS  Foreign Exchange Working  Group, Guy Debelle, assistant  governor of the Reserve  Bank of Australia, said:  In  a globalised world, the FX  market is one of the most  vital parts of the financial  plumbing. One of the guiding  principles underpinning  our work is that the code  should promote a robust,   fair, liquid, open and  transparent market.”  China set to liberalise commodities market Crude oil, iron ore and natural-rubber futures have  been earmarked as starting points for an opening   up of China s commodities market to more extensive  involvement from foreign firms, according to  China Securities Regulatory Commission  (CSRC) chairman Fang Xinghai.   Historically, foreign firms aiming  to hedge on China s commodities  markets have had to go through  an expensive regulatory vetting  process, requiring them to set up  locally registered subsidiaries from  which to conduct their trades.   In the wake of Fang s  announcement, made at the Shanghai  Futures Exchange annual conference,  firms from outside China are likely to find it  much easier to enter China s commodities arena.   The policy change follows a concerted CSRC  effort to crack down on speculative trades in  raw materials future on the part of Chinese  companies. The recent huge spike in activity and  accompanying volatility   mainly as a result of    noncompliant trading”   has, the CSRC said, been  successfully reigned in by a combination of rule  tightening and increased fees, and was prompted   by concerns that the increased trading could  jeopardise efforts to cut back excess   industrial capacity.  In Fang s view, the regulatory   action has created conditions for  greater participation from foreign  firms, as China sets its sights on  becoming a global, price-setting  hub for commodities.  China is the world s biggest  customer for metals and energy, but   its recovery is partly dependant on   a rebalancing away from infrastructure   development to a more consumer-led  economy. In addition, China has pledged to open  up its raw materials trading to overseas investors.   We re facing a chance of a lifetime to become   a global pricing centre for commodities,” Fang told  the conference.  On the way to realise this goal,  we ll see very intense competition.”  China bans firms from   raising non-core tech funds China s listed non-financial firms  have been forbidden from raising  capital for side ventures in four  specific technology fields, on the  grounds that those projects are  not part of the  real economy .  According to the Financial  Times, sources say new  subsidiaries in the internet finance,  video game, film and TV, and  virtual-reality segments have been  earmarked as ineligible for funds  raised through stock sales.  The ban means that China s  biggest corporates will find it  more difficult to diversify into  technologies that are helping   to define the future shape of   other economies.  Final phase of Hong Kong  infrastructure hub Finishing touches are being made  to a special agency aimed at  driving infrastructure development  across Asia-Pacific.   Dedicated to promoting  schemes devised under the   belt and road  scheme   a  transformative effort that aims to  spur sweeping reforms in public  amenities throughout the region    the Infrastructure Financing  Facilitation Office will be housed at  regulator the Hong Kong Monetary  Authority, which will coordinate  its work.  According to Hong Kong  financial secretary John C Tsang,  the office will bring together a  wide range of stakeholders from  the public and private sectors,   so they can share knowledge and  experience, arrange financing   for belt and road projects, and  collaborate effectively.  The office is set to consolidate  Hong Kong s position as a major  resource of capital. Speaking   at a multilateral Belt and Road  Summit Luncheon on 18 May,  Tsang said that his department  was  now in the final stage”  of establishing the facility, and  expected it  to be up and running  in a couple of months  time”.

If you have    views you d like the ACT policy and technical team to take  into account in responding to any of the subjects below,   please email us at technical@treasurers.org  The hearing was called   to discuss the responses   made to the Call for Evidence  on financial services  regulation. The following   are observations about what  was said by speakers and  delegates, who included  MEPs, members of the  financial services Directorate  of the Commission,   European Securities and  Markets Authority, and  representatives of the  financial services industry  and of the real economy.   There is general agreement  that the current regulatory  structure needs more   work, perhaps a revision   of some Level 1 law, that   is EU Parliamentary law,   but there is a lack of  quantitative data to be able to  prioritise action to maximise  the benefit to the real  economy. What regulators   ask is how customers,   exports, employees and  investors would benefit   from further amendments   to the legislation.  In the background, the  EU has failed to achieve  the real financial union so  necessary if it wants to create  a Capital Markets Union.  No pan-European markets  or banks have emerged to  take advantage of the free  movement of capital. Member  states and their agencies  appear reluctant to progress   to banker, which asks too  much: you cannot have  perfect safety and rigid rules  with commercial risk taking.  Someone, in regulation and  banking, has to be able to  make judgements. Bankers  need to believe they can take  commercial risk on the real  economy without undue  personal liability.  On liquidity The implementation of  the leverage ratio (LR) and  liquidity cover ratio (LCR)  are traditionally blamed for  a lack of appetite by banks in  cash, forex and bond trading  markets, but an alternate view  is emerging that historically  low rates make it difficult  to add lending margin. The  LR and LCR lead to selective  market targeting by banks  as they try to achieve the  high rates of return that  bank shareholders continue  to demand from what are  now considered to be safer  business models.   As a result, shadow-banking  markets continue to develop to  disintermediate the regulated  financial institutions, and  market practices continue  to change. For example,  export/import businesses  increasingly move to open  account trading as it becomes  more difficult and expensive  to put traditional trade finance  solutions in place.  Prospectus Directive 3 The ACT has engaged with  the FCA and with formal  responses to consultations  to ensure that the push  for simpler equity and  debt markets for smaller  issuers and retail investors  does not impact on the  existing wholesale markets.  The EU Parliament has  understood the concerns  that wholesale issuers have  expressed that a simpler  model, with constraints  on the presentation of risk  statements, could impact  issuer liability. We continue  to monitor developments of  legislation that could come  into effect by the end of 2016.  As the Deacon at Liverpool  Cathedral asked at the ACT  Annual Conference last  month, would a modern-  day institution appoint a  22-year-old to build a new  cathedral? Our forebears did  and the result is Liverpool s  Anglican cathedral, and it is  still standing and remains in  use as designed. Perception   of risk has altered…   Finally, we have Sven  Giegold MEP to thank for  noting to BNP Paribas that   a bank would not lend to a  real-economy business with   a gearing ratio as bad as that  of a bank.  CALL FOR  EVIDENCE Steve Baseby is ACT associate policy and technical director @BasebyStephen  THIS MONTH  and the EU appears to be in   a state of stalemate, but is not  considering withdrawing to  a less unified system. There  are neither the efficiencies  of a large unified market,  or the financial institutions  willing to take advantage of  economies of scale.  What we have is a financial  system that seeks growth by  pushing the economy with  low rates, while not asking  why there is a lack of will  to invest. We have a lot of  regulation that is good on  paper, but untested by crises.  We have a push to standardise  all financial institution  models, which robs the  economy of diversification     a disaster if the standard  proves invalid under stress.

IFRS: IAS 32 and  notional pooling The IASB has issued a decision  on the use of offset across  entities in a notional cash  pool: s3.amazonaws.com/ ifrswebcontent/2016/IFRIC/ March/IFRIC-Update-March-2016. pdf. This will affect groups that  periodically physically settle  notional cash pools. The IASB s  decision means that groups may  not be able to account for the  offset in period end accounts  unless physical settlement occurs  at or about the period end date.

Members who use interest-rate  swaps to fix floating rates need  to consider that the swap will not  have a floor if transacted under  an ISDA agreement and terms.  This may create a mismatch of  the floating legs if interest rates  fall below zero. For those that  hedge account, the impact on  hedge effectiveness should also  be considered.  { WATCH THIS SPACE }  ISDA protocols and agreements ISDA has issued further  standard letters to add  to its European Market  Infrastructure Regulation  (EMIR) Protocols.  These documents are  designed to ensure  market participants  clearly communicate  their relationships under  EMIR. While earlier  protocols were common  to all entities that are   participants to derivatives  (for example, the Portfolio  Reconciliation, Dispute  Resolution and Disclosure  Protocol), some of the  newer protocols are being  issued at the same time  as clearing rules come  into force, and may not  apply to all counterparties.  Members are advised  to refer to the ISDA site  (www2.isda.org/emir)   to understand which  protocols and other  documents they should  use in the absence of  bespoke amendments to  ISDA bilateral agreements.

Also, at the hearing on  17 May, Kay Swinburne  MEP acknowledged the  derivative asset cross- contamination problem  for NFC+, thereby opening  hope for its resolution.  { INTERNATIONAL }  FURTHER  CHINESE  MARKET  REFORMS    China s efforts to increase  liquidity and deter speculative   trading with regulatory and  market reforms have been widely  reported. I have blogged   on the need to retain some  perspective (blogs.treasurers. org/?p=314159) with China s  problems now increasingly  domestic, but within a country  with impressive FX reserves  available to manage its economy  and currency.   Measures to curb renminbi  speculation may include a   Tobin tax, but that there is   a need identified shows the  increasing liberalisation of   trade in the currency.  Offshore renminbi trading An interesting development  on the international scene   as  commentators try to foresee a  post-Brexit world and wonder  as to what would happen to  euro-based business   is that  London has moved into second  place (from third) behind Hong  Kong as the second-largest  clearing centre for the Chinese  currency as reported in the  Financial Times on 28 April (see   www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9fd82346- 0cf2-11e6-b41f-0beb7e589515. html#axzz48Q5ICpMa)  based on SWIFT data (see  www.swift.com/file/25776/ download?token=OoHlkSSb).   Notwithstanding the recent  diplomatic flutters, the SWIFT  data shows both that London   has a role in the development   of renminbi activity and that the  currency is increasingly being  used to settle trade with China.

I gained my financial experience working in the  accounting function in the recruitment and retail  industry, and had never even heard of treasury.  Then, in my last role, a number of staff left the  business at the same time and my CFO suggested  I help the treasury team. I learnt the cash  management process and haven t looked back. What do you like about treasury? That no two days are the same; I could be helping  to get payments into a sanctioned country,  evaluating long-term hedging programmes,   advising on a company card scheme and  reviewing the group-borrowing facilities with   our relationship banks   all in one day! What s the best thing about being a treasurer? Cash is king and we look after it   this allows me  to get involved in many different projects across  the business. I also love the fast pace   we often  have to drop everything to facilitate the release   of a payment whose failure could result in filming  on a production being halted. What s the best thing about being a member   of the ACT? The networking opportunities and the informative  webinar and conference sessions. I also enjoy  reading The Treasurer for its interesting articles and  up-to-date information on the sector as a whole.  Which ACT qualifications do you hold? I am currently awaiting the results of my final  exam and, if I pass, I will finally have my AMCT  diploma, after years of hard work. How has your qualification benefited you in  your career so far? The AMCT certificates have been invaluable to   me; building on the skills I had, they have given  me the tools and understanding I need to build    on my extensive practical experience and will  allow me to advance within the industry.  What s the most important lesson that you ve  learned during your career?  Don t panic… work through any issues  methodically and calmly to get the best result,  and never be afraid to ask for help.  What would be your best piece of advice to  someone else considering a career in treasury? Always remember we are the only finance  function that can  make  money for the business     but we can also lose it, too, so be meticulous.  What s your ultimate career goal? To be a respected treasurer with a wide range   of experience. If you weren t a corporate treasurer, what  would you be and why?

A combination of greater  longevity, absurdly oppressive  accounting rules and declining   rates of return have hugely  increased these costs, making  them virtually terminal for  some companies.  The problem is particularly  acute in the UK, where the  main source of private pensions  has historically been through  funded  defined benefit   schemes, where the employee  is guaranteed a certain level of  pension, sometimes related to  final salary.   Other countries, whose  private pension provision is  based more on the pay-as-you- go principle, face an equally  daunting, though different  type, of challenge, but it is the  UK model and the problems   it has thrown up that I wish   to focus on here.  There are approximately  6,000 defined benefit schemes  in existence in Britain today,  but the vast bulk of them    nine out of 10   have long  since closed their doors to   new members.  This has largely succeeded in  staunching the accumulation  of new pension liabilities, but  it can t do anything to address  the ballooning liabilities   of the past. At the last count,  these had given rise to a  combined accounting deficit    of roughly a quarter of a trillion  pounds, and much more on a  so-called  buyout  basis, which  calculates the present-day  costs of buying the same level  of benefit from insurers.  Pensions regulators  naturally insist that sponsors  close these deficits as soon as  possible by topping up their  schemes accordingly, but it   is a constant balancing act. If  they ask for too much, it might  put the sponsoring company  out of business.   In such circumstances,  the scheme falls back on the  Pensions Protection Fund  (PPF), which will continue to  service the liabilities, albeit   on a reduced basis. Two recent  high-profile cases   BHS and  Tata Steel UK   have served   to highlight the problem.   Yet since the PPF is paid  for via a levy on other defined   benefit pension schemes, it  scarcely looks an any more  sustainable construct. If the  solvent are forced to pay for  the insolvent, it will eventually  drag everyone down. And  the UK taxpayer would  presumably have to pick   up the tab.  UK government policy must  shoulder a large part of the  blame. Over-regulation and  the gradual removal of tax  breaks has widened the gap  between assets and liabilities,  thereby all but destroying  the incentives for providing  employees with defined  retirement benefits.  Ever tougher rules for  accounting for pensions   liabilities have further piled on  the disincentives. Even though  the liabilities stretch long  into the future, accounting  rules put companies are under  pressure to ensure matching  assets at all times.  The damage started in  the 1980s, when most funds   were still in rude health,  with substantial surpluses.  Concerned that this was  costing the exchequer tax  revenues, the government  forced schemes into taking  prolonged contribution  holidays. At the same time,  employees won substantial  increases in benefits, growing  the size of future liabilities   at a time when funding was  being reduced.  The other part of the  problem is simply that of  unconventional monetary  policy. Very low rates have  substantially increased the  notional costs of funding  future liabilities, such that it is  reckoned that a rise of only one  percentage point in market  interest rates would be enough  to eradicate many deficits.  There are, then, two  possible solutions: either  the pensions regulator could  choose to look through the  current level of deficits and  treat them as a temporary  aberration that will eventually  go away with rising interest  rates, or the Bank of England  could recognise the collateral  damage that low rates are  causing and tighten policy  accordingly. Unfortunately,  it would be most unwise to  count on either possibility.   Observers waiting for UK regulators to show their hand on how   they will address pension deficits are likely to wait a long time  JEREMY WARNER { PENSIONS }  UK benefit schemes have closed  their doors to new members  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer June 2016 The Treasurer  13  COMMENT    rates   proved somewhat useful during  the expansionary phase. But for the two  central banks that are now using it during  their tightening cycle, the US Federal  Reserve and the UK s Bank of England,   it might be a recipe for trouble.   Forward guidance, like many other  ideas in economics, finds its roots   in academia. As such, it has a solid  theoretical basis. The argument goes  that, by offering lots of information about  future policy intentions, central banks  can help to make the transition smoother,  especially in an already volatile world. In  practice, however, forward guidance can  be risky business. What if the guidance   is not properly understood? And what if  the world does not turn out as expected?   There is a good chance that recent  communications from the Fed and Bank  of England have been misunderstood.  Both central banks have frequently   used the words  slow” and  gradual”    Central banks in the developed  world argue that the achievement   of low and stable inflation for nearly   30 years is down to hard-won credibility.  Credibility helps central banks to do their  job; a lack of it has been the perpetrator  of some of the worst episodes of  hyperinflation in history.   What does credibility mean in practice?  Central banks are considered credible  when financial markets, businesses  and households trust the central bank  to achieve its mandate and know why  and how it is likely to react to certain  economic conditions. Over time,  credibility grows if a central bank reacts  consistently to changing economic  conditions in a way that is in accordance  with its target. In the developed world,  where central banks have adopted a  fairly simple policy framework, the most  common target is some annual rate of  inflation, usually 2%.   All else being equal, interest rates can  be expected to increase if inflation rises  above the target and decrease if inflation  falls below the target. This is known as  the reaction function. We have become   so accustomed to this reaction function  and hard-won credibility that low and  stable inflation is almost taken as given.  Even as central banks have undertaken   a once unthinkable amount of monetary  stimulus since 2008, inflation has  remained largely well controlled.     Why is credibility at risk? Amid the  post-Lehman recession and recovery,  central banks have been the only game in  town. Burdened with the unprecedented  task of single-handedly nursing the  global economy back to health, central  banks broadened their arsenal. One tool,  forward guidance   using forecasts to  influence market expectations of interest   to describe the likely paths towards   more normal interest rates. The trouble  is, this guidance has largely been taken   as a promise that interest-rate hikes   will be slow and gradual. But that is  not quite right. A nuance has been  overlooked. In reality, the Fed and the  Bank of England have announced that  they think future economic conditions  will only warrant a slow and gradual  hiking cycle. However, the future often  does not develop in line with economic  forecasts. As a result, these policy  predictions may not become a reality.  Central bankers have little more  information about the economy than  anyone else. That is part of the reason  why monetary policy works the best when  a simple, interpretable reaction function  is applied that central banks can lean on  and market participants can understand.  If central banks  predictions of slow and  gradual rate hikes do not materialise,  because economic conditions turn out to  be much better or worse than expected,  that could create an adjustment problem  if rates do not follow the predicted path.   To avoid a hit to credibility, central  bankers ought to gradually inch away  from complicated policies that rest too  much on the abilities of forecasters. The  chance of this happening is low. Even  with hikes, central banks will remain   the guardians of the recovery. At the very  least then, they ought to be more explicit  about the possibility of big surprises, even  if they don t happen.   Interest-rate predictions    a recipe for trouble? Forward guidance has provided a useful tool for central banks, but   there is a good chance it will be misunderstood, says Kallum Pickering  ECONOMIC TRENDS  Kallum Pickering is  senior UK economist  at Berenberg Bank  Central bankers have little more information   about the economy than anyone else  14  The Treasurer June 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer    This turns out to be one   of those strange occasions  when you think that banks  would be keen to take up  ancillary opportunities, but  there was less enthusiasm  than I expected.    I realised that backing  these lines with cash was,   of course, virtually risk-free   for banks, so I was surprised   at the level of uncertainty   and also at the proposed cost.  It was almost better value to  seek uncollateralised funding  and keep flexibility. That  option seemed to go down  better with the CFO anyway.   There followed even more  interesting discussion with  the insurers, whose views  on bank creditworthiness  differed somewhat from what  we might have expected, and   I was called into a  meeting with our head   of insurance, head of tax   and the CFO the other day.   I thought: this must be serious.  They have had a great idea,  and want to respond to ever- increasing insurance premium  tax rates   10% is now on the  horizon. The CFO is concerned  that the group is paying out too  much in insurance premiums  and mounting tax is adding   to this cost. They asked  whether we can consider  forming a captive insurance  company and manage the   cost and cash more effectively  by self-insuring.  It sounded a good project  and I was enthusiastic about  joining this project team.  Secretly I was hoping that   the new captive would   be formed in a glamorous  location and I may be asked  to be a director, but I wasn t  going to play that card… yet.  The specific question   for me was whether it was  cost-effective for there to   be a full-market risk transfer  via the captive. If not, there  would need to be some  collateral provided. In that  scenario, there was a further  choice. Whether to cash back  or not to cash back?   This came at an interesting  time, as the collateral would  usually be in the form of  letters of credit (LCs) and  might be a chance for banks  to compete for some ancillary  business. They keep saying  we offer too little to them,  after all. Given the number of  times I have had trade finance   teams offer products we don t  need, this seemed like a good  opportunity to see if we get  a positive response when we  make an enquiry.  I asked which banks among  our syndicate offered these  lines and received a bit of a  mixed response. Even more  so when I said that we d  like to know if they could  be extended without cash  backing, which would give rise  to a higher level of fees. Some  went as far as to say they d  need to get specific credit  approval from the next credit  committee meeting in a few  months  time, which surprised  me given recent discussions.  In fact, this appeared from  my networking to be a fairly  standard offering. I gave my  views to the relationship  managers privately!  { TREASURY INSIDER }  To cash back or not cash back?

They  clearly had their own limits  on individual banks. Insurers   credit officers are now another  counterparty we need to meet  with more regularly.  What we ended up with  was an even more complex  matrix of cost, relationships  and practicalities. Negotiating  LC facility and indemnity  agreements was not  straightforward either.  Ultimately, it was good  ancillary business for some  banks and we chose not to  cash back as, had we done so,  we would have tied up almost  as much cash as we would  have had we stayed with  paying premiums, but without  actually benefiting from full- risk transfer.  This arrangement does  place more onus on the  company to meet high-risk  management standards,  which is in keeping with  our public profile, so this all  aligns to our business strategy  and should save cost all-in if  claims are low.

COMMENT  Backing these lines with cash   was virtually risk-free for banks  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer June 2016 The Treasurer  15    Those of us in real- economy companies   in the US and in the   European Economic Area  have, in many ways, been   on the bleeding edge of  financial reform. However,  growing disparities between  regulatory regimes are  causing increasing  competitive disadvantages   to arise as we all operate in   a global financial market.   In the US, we have argued  that financial regulatory  reform measures should  promote economic stability  and transparency without  imposing undue burdens   on derivatives end users.   For multinational companies,  the need for international  harmonisation of derivatives  rules is especially  important. Regulators have  accommodated this view in  certain respects. However,  the European Market  Infrastructure Regulation  regime is generally more  favourable with regard  to capital allocations and  their resulting costs than  the Dodd-Frank Act and its  implementing regulations  have been for US companies.  I had the opportunity to  bring corporate treasurers   concerns before the  Subcommittee on Commodity  Exchanges, Energy and  Credit of the US House of  Representatives  Committee  on Agriculture on 28 April  (see www.agriculture.house. gov/uploadedfiles/deas_ testimony.pdf).  Although end users  successfully got amendments  to the Dodd-Frank Act with  bipartisan support that   exempt non-financial end  users from having to post  cash to margin derivatives,  regulations have been  proposed that will largely  offset the direct benefit.   End users are seeing the  impacts of the elaborate web  of new rules, including those  placed on their financial  counterparties. That is, rules  that require counterparties  to meet tests regarding  capital, liquidity and margin  have significant realised and  potential impacts on end  users. Despite being exempted  from capital and margin  requirements, end users still  face the distinct possibility  that hedging activities will  become too costly because  of new and higher capital,  margin and liquidity  requirements imposed on  their bank counterparties.   US banking regulators  are requiring banks to hold  considerable additional  capital against the uncleared  and unmargined derivatives  trades they conduct with  end users. This will result in  wider spreads they will have  to pass on to their end-user  counterparties. Here are  specific areas of concern:   Net stable funding ratio Under the net stable funding  ratio, long-term funding  costs will discourage dealer  involvement in derivatives,  thereby reducing available  counterparties and liquidity  for end users.  Supplemental   leverage ratio The supplemental leverage  ratio (SLR) does not permit   the clearing member to  receive  credit  for the  segregated initial margin  posted by its end-user  customers. The failure of the  SLR to recognise the   risk-reducing effect of  segregated client collateral  will likely lead to fewer banks  willing to provide clearing  services for customers and  will likely increase costs to  end users generally.   Capital valuation  adjustment Differences in the credit  valuation adjustment  (CVA) risk capital charge  between the US and other  jurisdictions, such as Europe,  also create competitive  disadvantages. Europe  provides an exemption that  avoids the CVA charge being  passed on to end users, but   in the US, no exemption  exists and the charge is  factored into pricing and  passed on to end users,  leading to the potential for  large pricing differences when  trading with US, compared  with EU, banks.  Non-bank swap   dealer models As many end users engage  in derivatives with non-bank  and bank swap dealers alike,  we are concerned about the  impact on liquidity of certain  restrictions on models for  non-bank swap dealers.   This approach requires   non-bank swap dealers to  hold potentially hundreds of  times more regulatory capital  that ultimately will force  them to exit the business,  leaving end users with fewer  choices for access to risk- mitigation tools.  To summarise, US end  users are concerned about the  apparent disparity between  an exemption from clearing  and margin requirements  on the one hand, and the  pass-through costs resulting  from new capital and liquidity  rules imposed on their  counterparties on the other  hand. We also fear that   cross-border regulatory  uncertainty and conflict  could put US companies at   an economic disadvantage.   These rules create real  impacts and costs on end  users  ability to manage  risks and access capital. The  imposition of burdens on end- user businesses restricts job  growth, decreases investment  and ultimately undermines  US competitiveness.

Opening the conference, heavyweight  economist, broadcaster and author John  Kay described the widening gulf between  our modern-day financial and banking  sector, and the corporates and individuals  that need access to it.   Modern economies, Kay argued, need  a financial sector that operates four key  functions. Firstly, it must provide a basic  utility by operating a payments system.  Secondly, it should enable individuals  to manage their wealth over their  lifetime. Thirdly, it should assist with  risk management and, finally, with the  allocation of capital.  Modern corporates, he argued, such  as Apple or Alphabet, have huge market  capitalisations and are no longer reliant  on markets, since they largely generate  enough cash to fund themselves. The  value in these large, knowledge-based  businesses is very closely tied to the  individuals who work for them.  That  requires a very different relationship  with existing shareholders and, in turn,  changes the way we think about  public markets,” he said.  Today s finance and capital   markets, with their complexity  and vastly increased emphasis on  intermediation, have become out   of touch with the general public   18  The Treasurer June 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  ANNUAL CONFERENCE  HIT REFRESH  Top to bottom:  John Kay, Victoria  Bell from Chatham  Financial and Tim  Harford all spoke  at the conference.

Liz Loxton reports  and the real economy in the wake of the  global financial crisis.   We ve pointlessly imposed large fines  on the major banks in recent years, but  the individuals responsible for their bad  behaviour have largely avoided criminal  prosecution,” he said.  There is still   a great deal of unfocused public anger  among people who know that something  went very wrong back in 2008.”   Another financial crisis remains a  genuine risk, Kay said, who would like to  see a financial infrastructure made up of  smaller, more focused institutions, with  a more reasonable system of incentives  and rewards.  If we have more specific  institutions, they will have shorter, simpler  chains of intermediation,” he said.

And yet  diversity is something we struggle  to achieve even in the face of the  evidence. Practical experiences  related by a panel discussion on  diversity on day one suggested  that reasons why individuals and  businesses grapple with diversity  is simply because negotiating our  way through linguistic, cultural  and personal nuances takes time.   We are hardwired to ignore  difference,” said Rachel Short,  psychologist and director of Why  Women Work.  The rewards that come as a  result of working through those  challenges are clear, however. We  work in a global context, Angela  Potter, MD of global transaction  banking at Deutsche Bank, pointed  out. Deutsche Bank operates in  more than 70 countries and 149  nationalities.  You have to reflect the client base on the  ground. At the same time you need innovation. But  diversity takes work and takes leadership,” she said.   The big frustration is why we re not getting there  sooner,” said Russell O Brien, group treasurer at   Shell. Setting up treasury operations in Singapore  took time, he relayed, but working through  operational difficulties in multicultural teams led  to greater clarity in terms of how individuals would  work going forward.  Diversity can t just be a target;  you have to go further than that,” he said.  Looking forward and looking back Futurist Rohit Talwar dazzled the conference in a  keynote presentation on the second day. He set out    a present we are far from getting  to grips with (most of us check  our mobile devices in the morning  before checking on our family,  he asserted) and a future where  health advances and wearable  and embedded technology will  prolong our lives far beyond the  120 years, often mooted to 180,   or even more.  The early effects of genuinely  disruptive technologies  developing at an exponential  pace are all around us, he  said. Artificial intelligence  will have the greatest impact.  Google s DeepMind AlphaGo  programme, for instance, stunned  commentators when it beat  a world-leading player of the  Chinese board game Go earlier  this year   a feat long-considered  out of the reach of artificial  intelligence due to the level of   intuition required. Hyperloop transportation systems  are set to dramatically cut journey times by 2020,  and   with the aid of 3D printing   buildings can be  assembled in hours rather than days or weeks.  These  are serious challenges to the value chains that exist in  big businesses today,” said Talwar.   These developments will need to be matched by  equally radical thinking about how we manage the  world of work. The challenge he offered treasurers  was to start conversations with real ambition.  How  do we halve the cost of a transaction or improve the  flow of money exponentially?” he asked.  In a presentation on interest rates, entitled  Lower  still and lower , RBS chief economist Stephen Boyle  said that while Talwar looked to the future, he liked  to look to the past for explanations of present trends.  When it comes to interest rates, Boyle  demonstrated that the current trends towards  persistently low rates had been in the making for  some time. In fact, interest rates were in decline long  before the 2008/9 global financial crisis prompted  recent drastic cuts, and have their beginnings in the  1980s, he said.  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer June 2016 The Treasurer  19  The Question Time panel (from  left to right): Katinka Barysch,  Peter Montagnon, Claire Emes  and Tom Keatinge, Alan Halsall  and host Mishal Husain  Futurist   Rohit Talwar  CONFERENCE  STATISTICS  1,098  attendees  16  different countries   represented  14  delegates from Chinese    multinationals and regulators  92  speakers  81  exhibitors  2  opera singers       CHINA S HARD HITTERS ON OUR DOORSTEP For the many delegates interested   in China s economy and the operation  of its financial infrastructure, a panel  session on day one of the conference  offered the inside track.   The round table included a  delegation of 14 senior financial  leaders   executives from Shanghai  Electric Group, China Petroleum &  Chemical Corporation and China  National Petroleum Corporation  (CNPC). These were joined by the  executive vice president of the China  National Association of Finance  Companies, Yanling Wang, which  regulates China s finance companies,   the special-purpose vehicles that  include corporates  treasury functions.  Interpreting and facilitating the  discussion, Jinny Yan, chief economist  at London-based ICBC Standard  Bank, pointed out that the corporates  represented in the discussion were  some of the biggest corporations in  the world.  On the agenda for discussion were  some of China s biggest economic  questions and, by implication, some  of the world s most significant  commercial issues. China s debt  levels, the expectation that currency  depreciation will continue and the   shift from an infrastructure-heavy  economy to a more consumer-led   one prompted discussion about   how China will restructure to reflect  that change and deal with a legacy   of overcapacity.   Yi Qin, general manager of Shanghai  Electric Group Finance Company,  said that recovery and restructuring  would take years rather than months.  The biggest challenge, he said, would  be achieving demand efficiency.  Overcapacity and lack of demand  were the significant issues, he said,  which Shanghai Electric s finance  function has addressed by looking  closely at cash flow.  This is something  our group has really concentrated on.   We try to manage the number of days  outstanding and the ways in which we  receive cash, and we obviously try to  manage our assets and debts. It s a   very conservative approach, but very  necessary in the context of China s  recovery,” he said.  Dr Zengye Wang, vice president,  director, Finance and Accounting  Research Institute, China Petroleum  Finance Company, said Chinese  consumers have a considerable  collective spending power still, which  will gradually be unlocked.  In every  aspect of the economy you can see  limitations   on housing and on cars.  There are economic and administrative  limitations on consumption. So there  is a lot of room to rebalance from  oversupply to consumption,” he said.   I see this low period in the  Chinese economy as a trigger to  reform how we operate. In my  view, the economy will rebound  after no more than two years,”  said Dr Wang.  The trend has continued because  underlying growth in major economies  has slowed while indebtedness has risen.   If we believe low interest rates are a long- term phenomenon, we should adjust our  expectations of what projects will produce  decent value,” he said.  Where he did venture his own  forward guidance was on the likelihood  of negative interest rates for the UK.  Boyle said he believes this to be unlikely.   Experience in Denmark and Switzerland,  where the policy rate has gone negative,  that policy hasn t loosened financial  conditions,” he said.  Nearer-term predictions made at the  conference included a well-attended  session on Brexit and the likely results   of the referendum on the UK s continued  place in the EU. In a delegate poll, an  emphatic 85% said they were in favour   of remaining in the EU and in a panel  session on Brexit, Standard & Poor s  global chief rating officer, Moritz  Kraemer, said the UK would lose its AAA  credit rating from S&P if the population  votes to leave on 23 June.  In its own straw poll of infrastructure  investors, S&P had found that around  half of respondents would be less likely  to invest in a UK disengaged from the EU,  Kraemer said.  While the balance of polls in the UK still  the  stay  camp only a slight lead, David  Marsh, MD of the Official Monetary and  Financial Institutions Forum, argued that  the remain camp will win out on 23 June  with a reasonable margin.  The silent  majority in favour of staying may only  become evident on the day,” he said.

You  could have that experience of taking a corporate through a full  refinancing   or refinancings, as it has turned out   and have   a really positive long-term impact on the company.”  Back in 2011, New Look had a capital structure that was light  on bank debt, but heavy on payment in kind (PIK) loans.   The shareholders at the time were looking to restructure that.    I found I could add a lot of value by supporting that process  with the senior executives and the management at the time,”  says Humphreys.  It was quite clear that the company would  have to go through one or more refinancings, and I saw that   as a great opportunity.”  Another attraction of the New Look role was the opportunity  to lead the treasury team.  In my previous role, I had been the  treasurer, but there were also other team members that reported  into a broader structure within a much larger organisation. Here,  I get to lead the team and report directly to the FD and CFO.”  New Look s treasury team won UK Medium/Small Sized  Business Treasury Team of the Year in the ACT s Deals of the  Year Awards 2015 (see The Treasurer, February 2016, page  29), so leading his five-strong team is clearly something  Humphreys excels at. An investor relations manager also reports  to Humphreys, and for the refinancing cited by the Deals of  the Year judges, the team was supported by colleagues from  the wider group finance function. The key responsibilities  for Humphreys at New Look cover the traditional treasury  risk management areas: liquidity risk management, FX  management, interest-rate risk management, funding  requirements and the associated effects on the balance sheet.   Investor facing  The other area that I m also responsible for, since I ve joined,   is the investor relations [IR] function,” explains Humphreys.  The background to this responsibility began in 2013, when New  Look went through a capital markets refinancing and completed  its inaugural bond offering on the capital markets. This saw  the company s balance sheet move from a bank-funded, private  loan-funded capital structure to a capital markets-funded  structure with predominantly bonds on the balance sheet and  some remaining PIK loans.   This change led to an influx of new investors, which was  the point that Humphreys set up a debt-IR function.  As we    Taking time out to travel to the northern hemisphere is  a familiar rite of passage for many young Australians. For Steve Humphreys, this also signalled the start of a different  journey   into the world of treasury.    When I came over to the UK in the late 1990s, to finance   my travels I was able to get a contract accounting role with   a software telecommunications company based in London s  Docklands,” explains Humphreys, now head of group treasury  at fashion retailer New Look.  I d been based there for around  six months when the FD approached me and said they would  be interested in me taking on more of a treasury role. This  was during the time of the dotcom boom and at the time the  company was expanding rapidly globally.    They were looking for someone who could manage the  international treasury exposures, predominantly through  liquidity management. There was a lot going on, with global  cash-flow requirements, FX and managing the ever-changing  liquidity needs of the international subsidiaries. I realised that   I really enjoyed the work.”  During the four years he was at Mobile Software International,  Humphreys began to bring operations into a centralised treasury  function, building a policy and a framework for how treasury  operated.  That s how I got into treasury, and I ve been doing it  ever since,” he says.  Following his return to the UK in 2005, after five years back  in Australia (where he spent his time as a financial accountant  and then assistant treasurer for multinational construction  and development giant Multiplex Group), Humphreys became  involved with the ACT, through the Certificate of International  Cash Management (CertICM).  That was a great certificate to  undertake as it gave me a really good overview of the theoretical  aspects of global cash management,” he recalls.  Through that  initial course, I had a great opportunity to meet and network  with like minds when it came to what they had to do on a day- to-day basis, be able to share experiences and really understand  that you are not alone out there in the world.”  Fashion goals After treasury roles at Peacock Group and BMW (UK) Capital,  and after passing his AMCT, Humphreys moved to New Look  in 2011.  This was a great opportunity because New Look was  at the stage where it had a capital structure that I felt had the   22 The Treasurer September 2015 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Dressed for success  22  The Treasurer June 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer      24  The Treasurer June 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  have a small treasury team, I set this up so that we  could report to them effectively and efficiently   as  the covenant of our bond facilities requires. I also  wished to promote regular ongoing communication  with investors through a variety of other avenues.  This includes our quarterly reporting, investor  conferences, investor meetings (either individually  or group meetings), setting up store visits or taking  them to our distribution centre. In conjunction,   I also set up a debt-investor microsite so that we  could store our financial information in a way that  lets our investors access it to see financial results,   the most recent quarterly reporting, investor reports  and any press releases or relevant news regarding   the company.”   The 2013 refinancing raised just over £800m   in bonds to support the New Look balance sheet.  This was followed in 2015 with another refinancing  that raised £1.2bn, which took place in parallel to  the acquisition of New Look by new shareholders,  allowing the company to completely repay the  existing debt and put in place new debt to fund   the business, so IR are more important than ever.   The IR function works very well for potential  investors, as well as existing ones, to give them   access to information to allow them to make  an informed decision,” says Humphreys.  If the  company says it is going to do something,   we do it and also report against that. The IR   function provides our investors with a very   clear reporting framework.”   Supporting strategic initiatives New Look has a core strategy that centres on brand,  product, international, menswear and multichannel.  Treasury supports all of these areas. One of the  most obvious ways is by looking after the liquidity of  the group, managing cash flows and ensuring there   is enough funding on the balance sheet to support  the strategic growth and plans of the business.    If you look at all of the strategic pillars as a   whole, the capital markets funding of the bonds   is an example of treasury s support to the business,”  says Humphreys.  The 2015 refinancing to fund the  business extended the maturity on our new debt   out to seven to eight years. Under the previous   debt, bonds were due to mature in 2018, but with   the new debt they are due to mature in 2022 and  2023. We also lowered the average cost of our debt   by around 300 base points.”  Expanding into China, the New Look treasury  needed to ensure that it was well funded and had  the liquidity to grow the China business.  We have  provided FX support when we are investing capital  into China, to set up the subsidiary and the support  centre in Shanghai, for example,” says Humphreys.   We also supply funding for the capex that is  required to open new stores. Approximately two  years ago we opened our first stores in Shanghai, and  today we have more than 85 stores in China. Treasury  helped support that strategic initiative, which not  only covers the international pillar, but also the  multichannel, brand and product pillars as well.”      VITAL  STATISTICS  £1,414.5m Total revenue for the   New Look Group   in FY2015  575  Stores in the UK   170+ Stores across Europe   and Asia   13% Amount of revenues   generated by   www.newlook.com   globally  £1.2bn Successful refinancing   in 2015  1969 First New Look   store opened in   Taunton, Somerset    www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer June 2016 The Treasurer  25  On a micro basis, treasury supports the brand pillar by  ensuring available funding for the ongoing refurbishment of all  of the stores to make sure there is a consistent brand identity.   To do that, you need the capex capacity and the cash flows,  helping to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity in place for  this initiative,” says Humphreys.   With the multichannel initiative, New Look s treasury  helps support the set-up of the acquiring relationships and  the banking relationships domestically in each country that it  expands into.  This support allows the New Look project team  to set up the stores, get the bank accounts opened and get the  acquiring relationships in place,” says Humphreys.  It also helps  to get the banks and acquirers talking to our IT teams, to ensure  that the connectivity between our point-of-sale equipment,   our PIN entry devices and our payment service providers are   all interconnected by the time we open the store.”   The multichannel support also sees treasury responsible   for fraud risk management, working with the payment service  providers on e-commerce to manage the fraud risk.  All the  transactions that go through our website also go through our  payment service providers  fraud risk management service,”  explains Humphreys.  On the product front, treasury is responsible for hedging all of  the FX risk related to the ongoing product purchases. New Look  does the majority of its buying in US dollars, so the treasury  function is responsible for buying those dollars and hedging   the forward exposures related to the purchases of the product.   We look forward around two seasons, so we can be buying  spring/summer or autumn/winter,” explains Humphreys.   Clearly, we have an obligation to pay suppliers at a point in   the future for the product that we are ordering today. Some   of the products can have long lead times, while a lot of it   can have short lead times, so we know that we have a certain  level of commitment rolling out over the next two buying  seasons. Treasury supports the business by actively hedging   the purchasing exposure to the US dollar.”  As with the international initiative, the menswear pillar  has seen the opening of new stores, with the first six stand- alone menswear stores recently opened in the UK.  We helped  support that by making sure that the connectivity to the various  acquirers is ready to go live on the day those stores were opened.  Equally, we also regularly communicate to our investors on the  progress we are making,” says Humphreys.

REBECCA BRACE INVESTIGATES  IK O  N  IM  A G  ES /P  AT R  IC K   G EO  R G  E  In the area of cash management, security and controls are fundamentally important. From payment fraud to the risk of error, corporate treasurers need to be aware  of the different threats that can result in financial loss.   It s inevitable when you are moving money around that  people will be thinking of ways they can defraud you,”  observes Chris Parker, independent treasury consultant  and the former group treasurer of private equity and  public companies.  The scale of such loss can be significant. Earlier this  year, hackers stole $80m from the Bangladesh central  bank after fraudsters obtained the bank s credentials.  Further transactions were stopped after suspicions were  raised by a spelling mistake; the total loss could otherwise  have run to as much as $1bn.  For corporate treasurers, it is important to understand  the full range of risks and threats   both old and new    and to make sure that appropriate security measures  and controls are in place to avoid these risks. While  cyberattacks such as the Bangladesh Bank heist attract  significant attention, the risk of fraud has been around a  long time. Security and controls should cover both internal  and external risks, as well as the more mundane issue  of payments made in error, at the wrong time or for the  wrong amount.  Depending on the nature of the business, companies  may also need to address the security of incoming   as well as outgoing payments.  For companies in the   B2C environment, it is also important to consider the   fraud risks associated with collecting money from  customers,” comments David Stebbings, head of   treasury advisory at PwC.  If you want to provide  customers with mobile payment options, for example,   it s important to understand and address the   associated risks.”  A further consideration is the risk that staff could be  forced to transfer funds under duress.  As we move away  from BACS and CHAPS, which can be stopped, to Faster  Payments and 24-hour payments, we become more  susceptible to this sort of fraud,” remarks James Kelly,  group treasurer at AB Ports.  Many banks offer a login   www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer June 2016 The Treasurer  29  password, which indicates a payment under duress   but  this could escalate a dangerous situation if the funds do  not appear to clear for the beneficiary.”  Taking action When it comes to tackling these risks, it s important   to seek out up-to-date information about the nature   of any possible threats. Nicholas Corker, assistant  treasurer at Severn Trent, says he engages in regular  update meetings with relationship banks in order to  understand current threats.  In my recent discussions   with banks, they ve highlighted how fraud is becoming  more sophisticated,” he explains.  When I get the  information through from banks, I ll forward that to   the relevant teams   the risk team, internal audit and  accounts payable.”  With a clear understanding of the possible threats,   it is important to mitigate any risks relevant to the  company. From understanding the risks to managing  tokens and passwords safely, treasurers should focus   on the following areas:  Standardise and automate When it comes to mitigating payment risks, Corker  says the main goal is to standardise processes as far  as possible. From an accounts payable point of view,  this means making sure that everything goes through  recognised procurement processes, such as a three-way  match, whereby supplier invoices are matched with the  relevant purchase orders and receiving reports.   If we have to make manual payments, we try and keep  those to a minimum, with full segregation of duties in  place,” he adds.  Internal audit has a rolling cycle of audits,  which includes reviewing our controls to make sure they  operate effectively. They report up to the audit committee,  which reports into the board.”  Corker says the company currently operates a manual  treasury management system, but that a goal over the  coming 12 months is to automate the system so that  payments go through an automated, rather than a manual,  approvals process.    CEO FRAUD  Also known as business email crime (BEC), CEO fraud   is a significant concern for companies around the world.   CEO fraud involves a fraudster sending an email that  appears to come from the account of the CEO or CFO of  a company. The email asks an employee of the company  to make an urgent payment to an overseas bank account,  usually citing a confidential project, such as an acquisition.  Increasingly, fraudsters are drawing upon personal details   to make these emails sound as authentic as possible, and are  often sent when the CEO is out of the office. The targeted  employee may receive phone calls as well as emails.  The losses resulting from this type of fraud can be  enormous. According to data published by the FBI, companies  have lost more than $2bn in the past two years as a result of  this type of scam. In February, Action Fraud UK revealed that  it had received 994 reports of CEO fraud in the past year    including one company that lost £18.5m.   BEC schemes where CEOs are targeted and mimicked  can be avoided through the execution of consistent payment  policies and additional mechanisms to confirm identify,  including electronic approvals and digital signatures,” says  Kyriba s Bob Stark.  Also, as these types of stories are  publicised, more CFOs and treasurers are able to recognise  suspicious behaviour and implement appropriate safeguards.”  Rick Martin, treasurer of GasLog, says that the company s  IT team weeds out most such attempts before they enter the  system.  On the rare occasions that they do, our staff is well- educated in identifying telltale hallmarks of these attempts,  and also in both the treasury policy, and the process/approval  flow charts that govern all payment processes,” he adds.   These are tested regularly by internal audit, and jointly  approved by the CEO and CFO. Further protection is provided  by strict segregation of duties, and authorisation hierarchies  that are embedded in both our enterprise resource planning,  and our e-banking platforms.”  exceptions to payment policies is one of the best ways to  achieve payment security,” he adds.  However, PwC s Stebbings points out that not all centralised  structures are suitable for managing all types of payment  risk.  Certainly, you want your high-value payments to go  through a centre of excellence so that you can control them  better   but the SSC may not necessarily have the specialist  resources for that,” he observes.  SSCs are often about saving  labour costs, which can work for commercial payments where  controls are likely to be in the enterprise resource planning    but they may not have the skill set needed for appropriate  control over irregular high-value payments.”  Have a consistent policy  All treasuries should have board-approved objectives,  policies and procedures,” says Parker.  Within those policies  and procedures, you should have a control framework that  specifies who can do what, what your authorised payment  instruments are, what the limits are, who can authorise a  certain payment and whether dual authority is required for  payments over a certain amount.”  Where policy is concerned, Stebbings points out that it is  important to have a clear understanding of who is responsible   Review processes Bruce Meuli, global business solutions executive, global  transaction services, at Bank of America Merrill Lynch,  emphasises the importance of regularly reviewing processes  from a control and compliance perspective, focusing on root  cause analysis of any events, the ability to identify, evaluate  and mitigate risks, and the continual education and training   of personnel.   Centralise payments Centralisation strategies can also be a useful tool in  strengthening security.  The best practice is to centralise  payments through a global payment hub. This means   that there is a single centralised system managing all  payments, sometimes run through a shared services centre  [SSC],” says Bob Stark, VP Strategy at Kyriba.  From a  technology perspective, implementing a single conduit   to the organisation s banks reduces risks, as well as   lowering costs and simplifying the management of   payment systems.”  Stark says that having a single payment system makes it  easier for CFOs to ensure that the same types of controls are  consistently applied to all payment workflows.  Minimising   CASH & LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT  SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K  30  The Treasurer June 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer    for payment fraud.  Clearly the treasurer is responsible  for treasury payments   but are they also responsible for  commercial payments? I suspect that if you were hacked there  would be some responsibility there,” he says.  So even though  this may not be the direct responsibility of the treasurer, you  would expect them to be involved with the writing of the  policy and making sure that the software vendors they use   are following the relevant policies.”  It is also important to make sure that any policies in place  provide consistency across the organisation.  Having different  policies for accounts payable payments versus treasury- initiated payments, and different procedures yet again for  special payments, such as M&A, is what creates exceptions  that fraudsters prey upon,” says Stark.  There must be a  payment policy that is implemented by all departments that  initiate, approve and remit payments.”  Nor is it enough simply having a policy in place.  It must also  be understood by the board and operational executives as to  how these policies are executed,” says Meuli.  Ticking the box  with a signed document is not enough. It must be an active  document that is reviewed and managed against performance.”  Manage passwords and tokens Rick Martin, treasurer of GasLog, says that the tokens and  passwords required for authorisation on the company s  e-banking platforms are strictly monitored by the system  administrators.  They are also limited in numbers to provide  sufficient segregation of duties and redundancy, but no  more,” he adds.  New technology may be helpful as companies look to  establish more secure authentication processes. Shirley   Inscoe, senior analyst at Aite Group, says that hardware   tokens, issued to cash management customers for many   years, can be overcome by some forms of malware.  In  addition, hardware tokens may break, be left behind and  not available when needed, or have the battery die at an  inconvenient time.”  However, Inscoe says that newer forms of technology can  be used to enhance security   citing the use of biometric data  to access accounts, including technology that enables users  to register their eye vein patterns, for instance.  This allows  customers to use the camera on mobile devices to easily  authenticate themselves without being bothered with user  names, passwords or tokens.”  Consider all threats While the latest cyberthreats may attract more headlines,   it is important to remember that not all payment-related   risks are highly sophisticated. Damian Glendinning, treasurer   of Lenovo, says that traditional, non-connected payments   and cash management processes are far from being   completely secure.    How hard is it to forge a paper signature?” he asks.  How  hard is it to intercept and modify a written instruction to a  bank, or a paper trade confirmation? How secure are voice  systems for placing orders, especially in the FX market?  Anyone who thinks these are safe has clearly never listened to  the recording of a trade captured on a tape-recording system.”  Conclusion Managing the risk of loss through error or fraud continues   to be a top priority for corporate treasurers. While new  threats may be arising, the tools that treasurers have  long used to manage payment-related risks continue to  be relevant   from the segregation of duties to effective   policies. That said, treasurers do need to understand the  nature of emerging threats, and should explore how   new technology solutions can build upon the safety  measures already in place.    The treasurer is  responsible for  treasury payments   but  are they also responsible  for commercial payments?”  Rebecca Brace is a freelance  journalist specialising in   corporate treasury and banking  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer June 2016 The Treasurer  31    The hard stuff NOTES AND COINS ARE STILL THE PAYMENT MECHANISM OF CHOICE ACROSS MUCH OF EUROPE,  BUT THERE ARE EFFICIENCIES TO BE GAINED IN ITS HANDLING, AS GRAHAM LEVINSOHN ARGUES  CASH & LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT  69% 45%  44%  58% 74%  86%  29%  61%  37%  37%  38%  36%  44%  68%  80%  80%  77%  53% 73%  76%  93%  95%  97%  64%  82% 77%  Country % of transactions made in cash  Luxembourg 29% Finland 36% Denmark 37% Netherlands 37% Sweden 38% Estonia 44% France 44% UK 45% Austria 53% Belgium 54% Portugal 58% EU 60% Germany 61% Slovenia 64% Latvia 68% Ireland 69% Hungary 73% Spain 74% Slovakia 76% Czech Republic 77% Cyprus 77% Poland 80% Lithuania 80% Malta 82% Italy 86% Romania 93% Bulgaria 95% Greece 97%  54%  32  The Treasurer June 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  The cash supply chain is highly fragmented across Europe and prey to chronic inefficiencies. In extreme cases, cash is  counted up to 17 times from till to bank. Even   in less extreme examples, the same cash may  be handled and counted multiple times as   it is transferred between parties in the cash  cycle, creating an unnecessary cost burden   on businesses and banks.  These are the key findings in our European  Cash Report, the first of its kind, in which we  studied cash use across 28 European (EU28)  countries. The inefficiencies we found are  troubling in the context of the varied and  changing European monetary landscape,  because even set against the rise of electronic  payments, cash has an enduring popularity.  Some 60% of all payment transactions  across Europe are conducted in cash, with  Bulgaria, Greece and Romania paying by   cash almost entirely. Cash usage is also high   in Austria and Germany.  Cash is the largest payment instrument  in terms of volume in all countries, except  Denmark, Luxembourg and Sweden, and  regional differences in cash use are arguably  down to the availability of access to cash by  the public through bank branches and ATMs.   We also found that the volume of notes   and coins in circulation has increased 13%   per annum since 2002. This growth is notable  across all denominations, but the €50 and  €100 notes contribute most to that growth.  Cash in circulation not only grows consistently  in the euro area, but also in other major currency  markets both within the EU (such as the UK),  and outside the EU (ie in the US and Japan).  In addition, the value for ATM withdrawals in  Europe, a proxy for cash payments, rose by  14.6% between 2009 and 2014.   Portugal leads in the number of ATM  withdrawals per capita, just before the UK.  Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, Romania and Slovakia  are listed as the countries with the lowest  score on ATM withdrawals per capita. This  is interesting as these countries are cash- intensive countries, and one might have  expected a higher ATM score.   Yet while cash volumes have continued  to grow over the past five years, they have  declined as a proportion of payments. The  proportion of all payments made by cash   has fallen, with 40% of payments across   the EU now made by card, electronic and  digital payments.  In eight European countries, non-cash  payments now make up a greater proportion    of transactions than cash. Countries in which  cash use as a proportion of payments is  currently below 50% include: the UK (45%),  Estonia (44%), France (44%), Sweden (38%),  Denmark (37%), the Netherlands (37%),  Finland (36%) and Luxembourg (29%).   Cards, credit transfers and direct debits  account for 94% of all electronic payments in  the EU28. Card payments now represent the  highest number of non-cash payments, 45%   of all non-cash payments.  Local branches of monetary financial  institutions offering payment services have  been in decline since 2009, by almost 10%.  France aside, access to cash via primary  outlets, such as ATMs and bank branches,   is also being restricted, despite the total SH  U TT  ER ST  O C  K    number of withdrawals at ATMs increasing.  Meanwhile, bank branches also show an overall  downward trend.   One could wonder why any industry would  actively limit access to a product that is  apparently in growing popular demand. The  question is a practical and even social one, and  was posed recently by the Sveriges Riksbank,  the national bank of Sweden.   Sweden is considered by commentators  as the most cash-free country on the planet:  public transport is cashless, five of Sweden s  biggest banks operate cash free where  possible, and even Abba s Björn Ulvaeus, the  man who composed  Money, Money, Money ,  reportedly gets by without notes and coins.1  Yet even in Sweden, the electronic new order  is being questioned, with the Sveriges Riksbank  calling for access to cash to be a legal right.  Riksbank argues that the banks have reduced  their cash-handling services too quickly for  consumers, resulting in notes and coins being  less available to the public, particularly in  remote areas of the country. Sweden became  the first European nation to issue banknotes   in 1661, and it seems even here they still have  a future.2  What we have learned from recent history  in Europe is that cash provides a secure and  trusted backstop, particularly in times of  crisis. In Cyprus and Greece, when capital  controls were introduced as a response to the  economic crisis, it was critical that ATMs were  replenished, and cash made available.   If cash is to continue to bridge the digital  gap, then cash handling must reform, and  processes across Europe must harmonise.   Europeans mostly rely on cash for their   day-to-day payments. We also found that  payment services, cash and cash logistics   share similar efficiency and reliability  objectives across the EU.   The big questions remain: how will cash  develop in the future? Which trends and  developments will have the most impact on  the future of cash? There is a fundamental  transition in the use of cash across Europe.  European consumers and businesses will  continue to use cash as part of a multi- payment economy. But we need to modernise  how they use it.  Across Europe the cash-transaction industry  must work with the banking sector, central  banks and policymakers to create this modern  lean cash cycle. Challenges include: • Shortening the cash cycle: reducing   participants, processes, resources and  funding from till to bank.  • Realising earlier value: ensuring cash value  is credited earlier.  • Reducing the cost of cash: minimising  handling and processing costs for cash.  • Combining the best of the old and the      www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer June 2016 The Treasurer  33  new with 21st-century cash: better interface  with electronic and digital payment methods.  We must take steps to ensure that cash  becomes a true 21st-century payment  mechanism, which integrates more fully with  digital payment systems. In practical terms   that means: • More units, more places: We can more   efficiently manage the cash cycle by  extending the existing cash infrastructure  across Europe.   • Removing the middle man: By minimising  the number of actors, we remove inefficiency  in the processing and counting of cash.   • More efficiency: Through a secure,  integrated cash cycle, the cash-to-bank  journey could be shortened.  • A shorter, more efficient cash cycle  generates immediate value for   deposited cash.   Root and branch reform will only be achieved  by streamlining and simplifying the cash   cycles across Europe, creating fewer transfers  between actors and consequently less  duplication of effort. Significant cost efficiencies  can be driven through the cash cycle so  that cash remains a cost-effective payment  mechanism into the future.

But we need to modernise how they use it          New-age  receivables WHAT INSTRUMENTS CAN A CORPORATE USE TO STREAMLINE ITS COLLECTIONS?   AJAY ADITYA PROVIDES A PRIMER ON OPTIONS USED ACROSS EMERGING MARKETS  CASH & LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT  34  The Treasurer June 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  The order-to-cash side of the working capital cycle caters to the revenue side of the business and begins when a buyer initiates  a purchase transaction leading to the creation  of a receivable. In an ideal world, corporates  would receive cash as early as possible to  reduce costs in the working capital cycle.  The choice of a receivables management  solution will depend upon factors such as  industry sector, size of the business, proportion  of local versus international business, the  competitive position of the company, market  conventions and buyer profiles. But when   it comes to what corporates want from their  receivables management approach, there   are fewer variables. Most corporates want   a collection infrastructure with these features: • Cost-efficient; • Straight-through processing; • Safe and secure; • Eliminates float; • Enhances fund availability; • Wide adoption and coverage; • Flexibility; • Possibility of reporting and tracking; • Reduces manual processing; and • Mature clearing infrastructure.  The solutions offered by banks can be  characterised as physical (cash) and electronic  (non-cash) forms. Here are some examples:  Physical instruments Cash collection is perhaps the most inefficient  and expensive option. However, benefits include  immediate availability, which makes it the preferred  instrument during illiquid market conditions. Cheque collection is still widely used in markets  such as India (and also in the US) due to the  prevalence of cheques as a means of funds   transfer. However, implementation of mobile- initiated cheque submission and truncation  options have reduced disadvantages, such  as float and overhead costs associated with  cheque clearance. Lockbox: Post-office boxes and drop boxes are  typically outsourced to service providers, such  as banks or other third parties. Cheques are  dropped with or without advice and are then  scanned and sent for clearing. Cheque details  are uploaded to client enterprise resource  planning (ERP) applications so that credit  can be immediately applied upon clearing,  and credit lines can be released for the buyer.  Benefits include reduced float and processing  costs due to centralisation and scale. Cheque management and discounting: In some  developing markets where cheque collection  is still underdeveloped, corporates use cheque  management and discounting solutions from  the banks. Examples of cheque management  users include housing or real-estate developers  warehousing post-dated cheques and  presenting them for clearing on the due date.  To obtain immediate credit, corporates can get  cheques discounted by banks to avoid paying  overdraft charges on a current account.  Electronic instruments Direct debit is the cheapest option available  to corporates. The buyer s commitment is  prearranged and no formal communication is  required before initiating the transaction, leading  to more certain cash forecasting. Further benefits  include a reduction in payer identification efforts  as corporates initiate the transaction and receive  information from banks on any individual failure  of direct debit instructions. Electronic payments: International collections  via SWIFT or charge cards are increasingly   viable. Using SWIFT, corporates can send MT101  or pain.001 messages to initiate transfer of  funds requests, whereby receipt would transfer  funds to the sender. A bilateral agreement is  required between both the bank and its clients,  so repeat payments are a condition for this  method. Charge card-based payments can  also be initiated by the payee. However, issues  such as charging in the receiver s currency  rather than the buyer s may make this option  expensive for larger amounts. There are now  various lockbox companies providing services  to corporates along these lines. Electronic lockbox is generally implemented  when collection services are outsourced or  shared by a corporate and its subsidiaries,  as scale is needed to make this option  competitive in some markets. Electronic funds  are received in a central account number on  behalf of corporates by the outsourcing entity  and then transferred to corporate ERPs at  periodic intervals along with reference/buyer  information to aid payee identification. Virtual account is where various buyers of  a corporate are assigned a unique identifier  by the bank, and buyers are asked to pay the  corporate using a combination of corporate  identifier and buyer identifier. Once the  payment has been received, internal processing  at the bank will make sure that funds are  applied to the right account of the corporate.   The benefits of this approach include  immediate identification of the payer and  application of funds, leading to faster release   of credit lines. This helps to substantially reduce  payer identification investigation and manual  processing at the corporate end. Main users  include telecom and utility companies, and  tax authorities   all of which expect regular  payment of smaller denominations.

This service has  been popular in nations where  financial inclusion is limited   due to the low profitability  associated with smaller deposit  base accounts. This service is  popular in markets like China,  India and Kenya. Benefits such   as 24-hour availability, immediate  transfer, low cost and the  extendable nature of this   service suggest huge potential  and growth.

The SMS model is the oldest,  where a customer is charged for  the goods or services by sending  an SMS to a particular phone  number and charges are applied  to the phone bill or mobile wallet  of the request originator.  Mobile operator billing   is used by e-commerce sites  for the payments of services  offered by them using two-factor  authentication. The benefit of  this model is that credit card  operators and banks can be  completely bypassed.  Contactless NFC payments   are made using smartphones   that are NFC enabled. The user  charges a prepaid account using  PIN authentication to approve   a transaction. Both the buyer   and seller should have an account  with the same bank providing   the facility.  Mobile web payment models  are based upon wireless  application protocol, in which   an application needs to be  installed or user connected by  a browser to initiate payment  transactions. Online wallets  services providers like M-PESA  (Kenya) or India s Immediate  Payment Service (IMPS) are good  examples of where users can  transfer funds to the beneficiary  using their network.  In the Indian market, the  national payment corporation   is at the forefront of rendering  this mobile wallet service  standardised and efficient.  To initiate a funds transfer  using IMPS, both remitter and  beneficiary need to register for a  mobile banking service with their  bank and receive a Mobile Money  Identifier (MMID). The payee  initiates the transfer using their  bank s app and by providing the  beneficiary phone number and  MMID along with the usual details.  Money is debited by the payee  bank from its account and a  payment instruction is sent to the  National Payments Corporation  of India for clearing. After  clearing, the funds are sent to the  beneficiary bank to be credited  to the beneficiary account, which  may be individual or corporate.

ANTHONY J CARFANG ARGUES THE CASE FOR PRIME INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS  CASH & LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT  36  The Treasurer June 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Consider what a great time it is to be a corporate treasurer on this side of the Atlantic. Low interest rates provide you  with a great opportunity to build a solid balance  sheet; the European Central Bank is rolling out  the red carpet for your bonds, even at zero  interest rates; inflation is quiet; there is ample  liquidity in the markets; banks are interested   in lending; the US dollar is relatively strong and  stable; the economy is moving along, albeit  in low gear; and technology is enabling and  empowering you to expand your remit and  create even more value for your company.  Now consider what a challenging time it is  to be a corporate treasurer in the US. Money  market fund (MMF) regulations are narrowing  your investment and borrowing options; the  Federal Reserve s $4 trillion balance sheet  overwhelms the markets and threatens to blow  up even the best strategies on the slightest whim  of the governor; regulators, seeing the end of  the current US administration, are running their  printing presses at full speed, an action certain  to create unintended consequences, while   Basel III rules are still winding though the  banking system with an uncertain, but  presumably negative, impact for corporations;  the interest-rate picture is not known; and  pooling structures are either going away or   are priced out of reach.  In this environment, we see our clients,  treasurers of large companies, focused on   three key areas: • Accumulating cash; • Preparing for the MMF regulations; and • Optimising their use of technology.  Accumulating cash Cash on the US balance sheets of companies  doing business there continues to rise. At    $1.94 trillion, corporate  cash has doubled since  the year 2000. At  Treasury Strategies,   we disagree  with pundits and  commentators who  cite lack of capital  spending and a slow  economy as the culprit.  Rather, we believe  that this is a long-term  trend in response to  uncertainty, concerns  about long-term access  to credit and a tougher  regulatory environment. Treasurers worldwide  are simply holding more precautionary cash on  their balance sheets.   Fifteen years ago in the US, corporate cash  was 9% of GDP. Today, it stands at 11%. In fact,  over that period, for every $1 trillion increase   in US GDP, corporate cash increased by $124bn  with an astonishing statistical significance   of 0.94.  As we work with corporates, we hear the  precautionary theme again and again. Will  banks restrict credit once the Fed tightens?  Will regulation increase the rate at which  public-sector credit crowds out the private  sector? Will Basel III and the Volcker Rule  make underwriting more difficult and costly?  Together, these concerns are driving corporate  cash accumulation and we don t see our clients  changing that outlook anytime soon.  Preparing for the MMF regulations On 14 October 2016, after a long battle, MMF  regulations will go into full effect. Prime  institutional funds will be required to float the   net asset value (NAV) and their boards will  be empowered to institute liquidity fees and  redemption gates.   These regulations have led to steady   outflows since the first proposals in 2010.   Assets have fallen from $1.7 trillion to   $1.2 trillion, mostly flowing into government  MMFs. There is speculation that the decline will  continue as the effective date approaches. In  preparation, many fund managers are shortening  their maturities. Some managers are investing  very little with maturities beyond October 2016.  Several problems flow from this:  • Prime institutional funds are the market s   largest purchaser of commercial paper. With  assets shrinking, there are fewer buyers of  corporate commercial paper.   • As fund managers shorten their maturities,  treasurers are left with issuing shorter-term  securities, creating transaction cost and  rollover risk.   • As investors, treasurers find themselves  relegated to lower-yielding government funds. Some treasurers feel that the combination    U S  co  rp o ra te   c as  h  le ve  ls  ( $t  rn ) 2.2  2.0  1.8  1.6  1.4  1.2  1.0  0.8 8.0  C o rp  o ra te   c as  h  ($  tr n)  US GDP ($trn)  2.4  2.2  2.0  1.8  1.6  1.4  1.2  R2 = 0.94  Slope = $15.8bn/quarter  R2 = 0.94  Slope = $124/$trn  1.0  0.8  10.0 12.0 14.0 16.0 18.0 20.0  De c 0  0  De c 0  1  De c 0  2  De c 0  3  De c 0  4  De c 0  5  De c 0  6  De c 0  7  De c 0  8  De c 0  9  De c 1  0  De c 1  1  De c 1  2  De c 1  3  De c 1  4  De c 1  5  $1.94trn  US CORPORATE CASH  SO U  R C  E:  F  ED ER  A L   R ES  ER V  E,  T  R EA  SU RY   S TR  AT EG  IE S    US CORPORATE CASH LEVEL RELATIVE   TO US NOMINAL GDP  of a floating NAV, liquidity fees and redemption  gates render prime MMFs a less effective  instrument and possibly at odds with the  company s investment policies. We have the  contrary view that the regulations simply  remove some of the clear advantages of prime  MMFs and place them on par with other MMF  instruments and bank deposits. Consider the  three key planks:  Floating NAV   Prime funds had enjoyed   a constant NAV of $1 per share and treasurers  loved that. Now they must float. In reality,  though, every other instrument in the market  that is not held to maturity with absolute  certainty also floats continuously. A treasury bill  that is sold prior to maturity will have fluctuated  in value and created either a gain or a loss for the  investor. Ditto commercial paper. MMFs are now  simply on par with all other instruments.  Liquidity fees   Again, MMFs enjoyed daily  liquidity, even when market stress imposed    fees  on all other market instruments. Clearly,  when an investor sells any other instrument   into a stressed market, that investor will incur   a haircut, tantamount to a liquidity fee. Similarly,  a depositor redeeming a certificate of deposit  prior to maturity will forfeit interest or incur  other fees, also tantamount to a liquidity   fee. MMFs are now simply on par with all   other instruments.  Redemption gates   This is probably the  most misunderstood market phenomenon.  Money markets are generally robust and there  are always buyers available to match sellers.  Well, not quite. Markets can and do experience  liquidity gaps, sometimes severe, in which  no transactions take place. The market  participants themselves impose the  gate. The most significant recent  example was the freezing   of the auction rate  securities market  in 2008. Some  investors are still  unable to sell those  securities, effectively  experiencing  an eight-year  gate! Most bank  depositors are  unaware that, in  the event of a bank  failure, the Federal  Deposit Insurance  Corporation is  not obligated  to immediately repay depositors. Uninsured  depositors (most corporations) could  conceivably wait for years in the case of   a complex resolution.  Treasurers are gradually becoming aware   that, from the standpoint of investor utility,   prime institutional funds are still the most  attractive instrument. We believe that, although  assets will continue to decline as we approach  the October go-live date, they will rebound  quickly and remain the instrument of choice   for US treasurers.  Optimising their use of technology Over the past several years, companies have  been very busy upgrading their treasury  technology. For most, this meant replacing   older treasury workstations or upgrading   to newer versions. As these systems grew    in power and functionality, many  companies underestimated the  complexity of the implementations.  They became the platform for   efficient liquidity management.    www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer June 2016 The Treasurer  37  The upshot was that many companies  implemented the basics while the more  advanced features were postponed until  Phase II. Although the core cash management  processes were automated and the new  technology added value, there remained  numerous Excel or other external workarounds.  Many corporate treasuries are embarking on  Phase II this year. Companies are implementing  modules that had been purchased, but unused.  Investment tracking, FX, debt management,  cash forecasting and risk management generally  top the list. They are improving connectivity  with all of their banks, not just a few. They are  implementing comprehensive bank account  management tools as well. This is a tall order  and will keep companies busy well beyond 2016.  Challenges for US corporate treasurers  abound. The market has given a temporary  reprieve in the form of low rates and a relatively  strong dollar. Wise treasurers are taking  advantage of this environment to upgrade  their treasury systems, improve their business  processes and strengthen their balance sheets.

Regulatory authorities have  relatively little exposure to   issuers, so work carried out by the   International Capital Market Association  (ICMA) to encourage interaction and  collect views from market participants   is welcomed. Work on key areas of  regulation that have an impact on  corporate treasurers is outlined below.  Standardisation One of the remits of ICMA is to explore  market-led solutions to ensure the  efficient functioning of the markets.  This currently includes addressing the  secondary market liquidity challenge,  an area on which there has been much  debate around the standardisation of  corporate bond issuance.  The standardisation debate may   be viewed as one of a whole series   of incremental measures that the   market can take to improve secondary  market conditions; another related  measure is the development of   electronic trading. However,   electronic trading platforms don t   lend themselves to trading corporate  bonds, which are heterogenous, diverse  and very different to equities. For  electronic trading to work, it would   Examining  the small print THE PACE OF REFORM OF CAPITAL MARKET ACTIVITY IN   EUROPE RARELY SLACKENS. IN PART TWO OF A REGULATORY  OVERVIEW, KATIE KELLY SETS OUT ICMA S POSITION ON   KEY AREAS UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT  require a more homogenous product,   ie standardised bonds.  The discussion is likely to continue.  The European Commission s approach,  which is reflected in its Capital Markets  Union (CMU) Action Plan, is that this  issue is very much for the market to sort  out. To this end, no relevant regulation  is proposed. Concerns have been  highlighted by ICMA to the European  Commission on its Green Paper on CMU,  as well as to the Fair and Effective Markets  Review as to, among other things, loss  of flexibility of funding for the issuer  (and appropriate issuer compensation),  fragmentation of the market, refinancing  risk, inadvertent volatility and market  infrastructure capacity.  Prospectus Directive III One of the conclusions of the European  Commission s CMU Action Plan  announced in September last year was  a review of the Prospectus Directive,  resulting in Prospectus Directive III.  Proposals include:  • removing the flexibility that issuers of   certain non-equity securities currently  enjoy to choose their home member  state, which would mean that they  would no longer be able to choose   which competent authority approves  their prospectuses;   • removing the €100,000 denomination  distinction for disclosure purposes and  applying one disclosure regime to all  securities and requiring a summary   for all issues of securities;   • obliging issuers to categorise risk  factors according to their materiality  (high, medium and low risk), and  limiting the number of risk factors  that can be included in a summary   to the five most material risks; and  • requiring a summary for   all prospectuses.   Concerns around these areas have  been brought to the attention of the  European Commission, as well as to  national regulators, by ICMA.  Pan-European Private Placements The Pan-European Private Placement  (PEPP) market aims to benefit medium- sized and unrated companies by  providing long-term debt funding that  may not otherwise be available to them  from the loan or bond markets. It may  serve in this way as an intermediary and  preparatory stage for these companies  before they gain access to the public  debt markets. The investment market is  institutional, with a buy-to-hold strategy.  The PEPP Joint Committee,  coordinated by ICMA, has published  a market guide, which sets out best  practice and recommendations,  defines the roles of parties and explains  expectations in terms of disclosure and  covenants. The joint committee also  promotes standardisation of transaction  documentation and identifies barriers   to entry for new issuers and investors  into this market. In its CMU Action Plan,  the European Commission indicated  that it is fully supportive of this work.   Context of treasury The business context  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer June 2016 The Treasurer  39  SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K  Katie Kelly is a director in the  market practice and regulatory  policy team at ICMA    40  The Treasurer June 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Context of treasury  Accounting, tax and regulation   IFRS 9   a conversation killer if ever there was one. But while the  international financial  accounting standard has   gone through a long period   of stop, start, review and  consultation, it is finally   time to take a closer look   at its impact.   The standard is effective  for annual periods beginning  on or after 1 January 2018 and  the new hedge accounting  requirements are more  principles based, less  complex and provide better  links to your company s risk  management activities than  IAS 39. IFRS 9 also allows  companies to apply hedge  accounting more broadly  to manage profit or loss  mismatches and improve  what might be regarded   as ineffective hedging   under IAS 39.   SH U  TT ER  ST O  C KKey changes introduced   by IFRS 9 • The removal of the 80-125%   highly effective threshold.  Moreover, when there is  a change in the economic  relationship between   the hedged item and   the hedging instrument,  an adjustment to the  economic hedge ratio,  known as rebalancing, can  be introduced (see below).  • Generally, more items  qualify for hedge  accounting, for example,  pricing components within  a non-financial item and  net FX cash positions.  • Companies can now hedge  account exposures that give  rise to two risk positions  (for example, interest- rate risk and FX risk, or  commodity risk and FX  risk) that were previously  managed by separate   derivatives over different  time periods.  • We can expect less profit- and-loss volatility using  options, FX forwards  and FX foreign currency  swaps. For example, a time  value/interest differential  component can now be  deferred under other  comprehensive income  (OCI) and can either be  amortised to profit or loss, or  capitalised into the hedged  item, depending on the  nature of the hedged item.   • New alternatives are  available for economic  hedges of  own use   contracts that have the  potential to reduce profit- and-loss volatility.  • Fair-value hedging at  group consolidated level  with offsetting hedge item  positions is possible, for  example, asset-side bonds   at fixed-rate offset with  liability-side fixed-rate bonds  using an interest-rate swap.   • Cash-flow hedging at group- consolidated level with  offsetting or net positions  (for example, acquisition of  a non-financial asset offset  with non-financial liabilities)  is permitted, providing  critical terms are met.   • Equity investments  at fair value through  other comprehensive  income (FVTOCI), where  ineffectiveness can be  recorded in OCI.  • Cash instruments  measured at fair value  through profit and loss  (FVTPL) are eligible as  hedging instruments, too.  Who benefits? Organisations engaging in  economic hedging activities  (irrespective of applying   THE EFFECTIVE DATE FOR IFRS 9 MAY BE SOME WAY OFF, BUT WITH WIDE-RANGING IMPACT,  TREASURERS WOULD DO WELL TO LOOK CLOSELY AT ITS IMPLICATIONS, DEE KOTHARI ARGUES  Rule changes, anyone?     www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer June 2016 The Treasurer  41  structure with a second GBP  interest-rate swap paying  floating one-month Libor   and receives a fixed rate for   18 months. IFRS 9 would  allow the second interest-rate  swap as a hedging instrument  for the first 18 months of the  bond against the first cross- currency interest-rate swap,  using partial-term hedging. Commodity hedging: For  hedges of non-financial  items, for example,  forecasted commodity  sales or purchases, the  hedged risk can only be the  FX-rate risk or the entire  cash-flow variability (which  typically can include freight  and insurance), and that  increases the risk of hedge   ineffectiveness under IAS 39.  IFRS 9, on the other hand,  states that we can select an  observable and measurable  risk component for the  financial and non-financial  hedged item, thus limiting  variability, which would not  impact hedge ineffectiveness.  For example, we sold grade  A zinc physical based, on  the future average base zinc  LME price plus freight for  delivery in one month s time.  The reference derivative  here would be the zinc LME  average price for the month. Hedging a layer  component: Cash-flow  hedges under IAS 39 can  be based on a proportion  (percentage) or a portion  (layer) of a specific item or  group of items. However, a  fair-value hedge is restricted  to proportions of specific  items, so that there is  traceability to the hedged  item. Under IFRS 9, however,  a fair-value hedge can now  be assigned as a percentage  or proportion of the hedged   and credit risk must not  dominate value changes from  that economic relationship.  For instance, physical  purchase of jet fuel that   will be priced off Platts  price  benchmark with the reference  derivative to a London Metal  Exchange (LME) precious  metal price (gold) would  be disallowed, even though  correlation is highly effective. Rebalancing is prohibited  under IAS 39, whereas IFRS 9  prospectively permits altering  the hedge ratio without  discontinuing or terminating  an existing hedge-  accounting relationship   to improve effectiveness. Hedge effectiveness:   IAS 39 requires prospective   effectiveness testing using  a qualitative approach,  such as  critical terms   if met or a  quantitative  test  if critical terms are  not met. Retrospective  effectiveness testing requires  a quantitative approach.  On the other hand, IFRS 9  prospective effectiveness  testing can be qualitative,  using critical terms, which is  acceptable still. Retrospective  effectiveness testing is now  no longer required. Derivatives as hedged  items: Derivatives are   not allowed to be part of   a hedged item under IAS 39.  However, they are allowed  to be part of a hedged item  under IFRS 9. For example,  imagine a GBP functional  company issuing a 15-year,  JPY-denominated fixed-  rate bond. It synthetically  converts it into a 15-year,  fixed-rate GBP bond where  critical terms are met using  a cross-currency interest- rate swap. The company  then decides to overlay the   hedge accounting under  IAS 39) have the greatest  likelihood of benefiting from  the changes. Corporates in  mining and natural resources,  airlines, agriculture and  other industry sectors that  use commodities are among  those likely to benefit. The  same goes for entities with  significant foreign currency  transactions or foreign  funding sources that use  derivatives to manage risk   in their treasury and/or  business activities.   How to use IFRS 9   hedge accounting There are a few scenarios   that highlight the main  differences between IAS 39  and IFRS 9 in terms of its  practical application: Non-compliance with  the company s risk  management strategy:  Under IAS 39, as long as   the hedge is documented   and effectiveness testing   is met, hedge accounting is  permitted. However, IFRS 9  states there is a requirement  to comply with the risk  management policy of the  company to achieve hedge  accounting. For example,  rolling FX swaps or FX  options to hedge three years  out would not be permitted  if the risk policy states up  to two years only. Another  example could be where the  risk policy states that interest- rate risk can only be hedged  when borrowings or funding  is drawn or received. This  policy would prevent treasury  entering into a forward-rate  agreement or forward-start  interest-rate swap.  Conditions to achieve  successful hedge  accounting remain largely  unchanged from the former  standard, but IFRS 9   stipulates additional  qualifying conditions on top  of IAS 39. Importantly, an  economic relationship must  exist between the hedged  item and hedging instrument;   item, for example, part of a  monetary transaction volume,  physical volume or nominal  amount. For instance, hedge  the first five million cubic  metres of natural gas; the first  500 barrels of oil purchased;  the first 500MWh of  electricity sales; the last $20m  of a $100m firm commitment;  or $50m of a total $150m of  floating-rate debt. Net profit margin hedging  for FX risk is not permitted  under IAS 39. Surprisingly, and  to the benefit of highly astute  CFOs and treasurers, IFRS 9   allows the fair value of the  derivative to be shown below  the sales and cost of goods  sold (COGS) line, as a  hedging  result  under a cash-flow    hedge, as the accounting  result of the derivative cannot  be grossed up to affect both  the sales and COGS line.  What now? While there is some time  to go before mandatory  adoption is upon us, there  are some benefits to adopting  IFRS 9 early. As a first  step, setting up an IFRS 9  project team with treasury  and finance colleagues in  the driving seat and IT as  business partners to set out  your road map for IFRS 9  adoption is a task that   should be undertaken sooner  rather than later. As with   all new international  accounting standards, the  impact will affect systems,  people and processes time  and time again.

Crucially, they  often fail, for example,  to make even the most  rudimentary test calls to  their own hotline. From  personal experience, seven  test report calls made to an  organisation s internally  provided hotline exposed   an informal triaging  process, which resulted  in only two of those  reports making it all the  way through the process.  Moreover, the handling of  one call, made in a major  European language, was  so dire and slow that only  the most determined caller  would have persisted.  Organisations often  underestimate the importance  of their hotline infrastructure.  So, for example, free-to-call  is pivotal when it comes  to encouraging reporters  to make their call. But  achieving that objective in  all countries of operation  can often appear to be an  impossible challenge. The  resulting mixed approaches  will lead to companies issuing  instruction handbooks that  run to 30 pages of numbers  and complex instructions.  The procedures tend to be  especially complicated for  callers who want to remain  anonymous. Clearly, again,  this inevitably serves to  directly deter callers.  Companies often fail to  consider the situation in  countries where they have  a low employee population,  but a high risk-operating  environment, with the result  that whistle-blowing report  volumes often tend to be   low, because employees   IK O  Na whistle-blowing facility,  provided either internally  or externally, or through  a combination of both.  Organisations will often  first establish an internal  whistle-blower facility and  subsequently migrate to an  external hotline provider,  which brings with it a  potentially wider range of  intake channels   including  telephone, email, letter, fax,  web forms and manager  conversation capture    together with multi-language  capability and managed  anonymous reporting.  However, organisations  often set up their whistle- blower hotline and, with    MOST ORGANISATIONS WILL SAY THEY DON T RETALIATE AGAINST   WHISTLE-BLOWERS. THE REALITY IS A LOT HARSHER, SAYS KEITH READ  Whistle-blowing, and  whistle-blowers, are  rarely out of the news;    a whole industry has sprung  up around whistle-blowing  and it takes just moments   to find a myriad of articles  and learned papers about   the subject. However,   there are some practical  whistle-blowing realities   that organisations need   to be aware of   and,   crucially, they need to ask  themselves whether that   anti-retaliation  policy,  however well-structured   and carefully written, really  prevents retaliation.  Most companies and  organisations now have    BACKLASH     www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer June 2016 The Treasurer  43  individuals  subsequent  annual performance review  markings, pay rises, bonuses,  disciplinary actions and an  evaluation of their career  progression compared to  their peers. Not a full or  exhaustive set of data, but  a subset that I could work  with to get an indication of  whether my concerns were  real or imagined.  It became obvious within  minutes that retaliation was  clearly taking place; not  everywhere, and not affecting  every whistle-blower, but it  was there. Moreover, some  divisions, departments and  locations had a noticeably  greater propensity for  retaliation than others and,   I suspected, some of that was  linked to certain managers  and senior managers.  Confirming that issue was  largely beyond manual  analysis, given frequent  organisational changes and  movement of individuals  within the organisation.  Some individuals had  clearly been high performers  prior to blowing the whistle;  after that event   at least  if the performance review  markings were to be believed    their performance had  declined sharply and, in some  cases, had never recovered;   a loss to them, and a loss to  the organisation.  The reality  Armed with this analysis,   I was at least in a position  to raise the issue   the  reality of retaliation   and  to get the message out there  that retaliation was being  monitored, however simply  and crudely. I would like to  think   and there was some  evidence to this effect   that   poor   often because of a  misplaced perception that   retaliation wouldn t really  happen here”.  Moreover, despite all these  no-retaliation policies, it  takes just moments to find  appalling cases of retaliation    involving some very high- profile and household name  organisations   that have  taken place on both sides of  the Atlantic, and elsewhere.  Organisations invariably  find it a challenge to  implement effective key  performance indicators for  their compliance programme,  and the question of how to  measure outcomes becomes  even more challenging when  it is related to retaliation.  Professionally, I have seen  many instances of retaliation  in action. The problem is that  it can take many forms; it can  take place at organisational,  manager and colleague  level, and involve both   hard  and  soft  retaliation    ranging from hard cases:  discipline, dismissal and  harassment, right through  to soft cases: loss of a  whistle-blower s career,  including advancement,  loss of overtime and other  opportunities. Whatever  form the retaliation takes,  it certainly affects the  individual and means   that other people will  inevitably think twice   about whistle-blowing.  Retaliation data In one case, where   I suspected that, in spite  of the existence of an anti- retaliation policy, retaliation  was alive and well within   one particular organisation.  I decided to try to look at the  whistle-blower data   who  the whistle-blowers were  and where that information  was available   and then link  those individuals to data that  could indicate retaliation.  This data included the   wanting to make a report are  fearful of identification by a  simple process of elimination.  Put simply, if there are 10  employees and their manager  in a country office, then it is  not going to be that difficult  to identify who might have  made a report. There are  techniques that can be used  to deal with types of exposure  issue, but organisations often  fail to consider them and, as   a result, forego what can often  be vital information.  Anti-retaliation policies The vast majority of  organisations have an anti- retaliation or no-retaliation  policy for whistle-blowers  and, without question, it is  clearly the right thing to do.  However, most policies are  just that   they sit on the   shelf and often have little  impact on what happens   in reality day to day. Indeed,  particularly in the case  of anti-retaliation, policy  communication is relatively   Keith Read is  an independent  compliance consultant  The vast majority of organisations   have an anti-retaliation or no-  retaliation policy for whistle-blowers  retaliation lessened to a degree  once that signal had been sent  around the organisation. But,  clearly, it can take years for  patterns to emerge.  Five years on from that  particular example, at almost  every compliance event, the  question of whistle-blowing  comes up and the discussion  usually turns quickly to the issue  of retaliation and anti-retaliation  policies. I invariably ask how  compliance officers know that  their policy is working. Without  exception, people reply that they  don t, but that they do have a  policy. Talking about how even  rudimentary analysis could be  put in place often turns out to  be a  light-bulb moment . People  start to discuss what simple  analysis they could undertake  within their own organisations.  Anti-retaliation systems  Going forward, organisations  will be able to bring their  compliance-related systems    covering whistle-blower  hotlines, case management,  policy communications and  training   together with their  core HR data, such as annual  performance review markings,  pay rises, bonuses, disciplinary  actions, career progression,  overtime awards and suchlike.  This will transform this simple  approach into an effective   real-time compliance tool     one that enables organisations   to be confident that they  genuinely have no retaliation    and that they are in a position   to prove it.     Financial risk management Manage risks  IK O  N  IM  A G  ES /G  A RY   W AT  ER S  IN THE FACE OF HISTORICALLY LOW INTEREST RATES,  TREASURERS FACE NEW RISK CONUNDRUMS.   PAOLO ESPOSITO REVIEWS THE OPTIONS  44  The Treasurer June 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Declining interest  Global interest-rate markets are experiencing unprecedented   conditions. In addition to  issues such as the potential  impact of Brexit, currency  wars, de-pegging and  devaluation over the past   year, we have also seen a   great deal of debate around  quantitative easing, timing   of interest-rate hikes or cuts,  and monetary policies.   In April 2016, there  were roughly $7 trillion of  government bonds (about  one third of the Bloomberg  Global Developed Sovereign  Bond Index), offering negative  yields, which is just one  example of the peculiarities  of today s situation. This is  the case for the euro, Swedish  krona, Swiss franc, Danish  krone and Japanese yen.  And it seems likely there  is yet more uncertainty to  come. It is expected that the  volatility around interest-rate  and monetary policies that  characterised 2015 and this  year to date will continue.  The following are some of  the new challenges corporate  treasurers face when it comes  to managing interest-rate  risks for their companies. This  is particularly relevant today,  as many corporates have a  variety of currency exposures  to manage and diversified  funding sources.  Negative rates From a cost of borrowing  perspective, negative rates  should be good news,  reducing the overall funding   cost companies pay. Most  commercial loan agreements,  however, now include the  so-called  zero-rate  provisions  as standard, ie clauses that,  when rates go negative, set the  rate to zero. These provisions  are clearly a cost for the  corporate borrowers, as they  prevent them from receiving  the benefits of negative rates.  From a financial standpoint,  these provisions constitute  floors that the borrower has   sold  to the lender (notably,   without receiving the  corresponding market value).  Under the current market  conditions, these floors can  cost the affected corporates  several millions: on a €100m,  three-year facility on the Euro  Interbank Offered Rate three- month index, the missed  benefit in funding savings  is today in the region of  €700,000. Corporates need   to correctly assess their future  cost of funding, especially  those that are highly leveraged   or cyclical businesses that  require the full cost benefit of  falling rates to compensate for  lower economic performance  during downturns.   The cash cost of the 0%  floor in presence of negative  rate (some of which are  shown on the opposite graph),  however, is not the only issue:  the floors create an extra set  of complications from a risk  management standpoint.  Hedging challenges   from negative rates About two-thirds of UK  listed companies actively  manage the interest-rate risk  associated with their debt,  and the most common way to  achieve this, historically, has  been by entering into a swap.  Normally, this provides very  suitable hedging results as  the floating flows on the swap  perfectly match and offset   the floating flows on the   debt, leaving the company  with a synthetic fixed debt  and removing undesired  earnings volatility.   In an environment of  negative rates, however, the  company would not end up  with a fixed rate. If a company  elected to enter into a swap  when the loan includes a   zero-rate  provision, then the  negative floating flows on the  swap would not be matched  by offsetting negative flows   on the loan, since the 0% floor  removed this benefit.   The end result is not only  that swaps no longer provide  certainty of interest expense  when rates are negative,      www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer June 2016 The Treasurer  45  The only additional  consideration is that,  when looking at hedging  derivatives, swaps or options  on shorter maturity indices  (such as one month if  compared with six months)  could be a bit more  complicated to structure, as  they are less liquid. Pricing  of derivatives based on one- month Libor indices should  therefore be discussed  in greater detail with the  hedging bank(s), or with the  support of a hedging adviser,   to ensure that corporates  receive the full benefit of   the current basis differential.  Interest-rate volatility The volatility of rates has  been historically high across  currencies, geographies and  maturities. While market  turbulence puts hedging  policies to the test and makes  it more difficult for a company  to make risk management  choices, it also makes some  hedging products more  expensive than others. This is  the case for derivatives, which  include optionality (such as  caps, floors and swaptions), as  opposed to swaps. Volatility is  in fact one of the inputs of the   this strategy requires some  expert support in derivative  negotiation and structuring.  Basis differential Another issue that is  compounded by the current  situation is the difference in  rates between the various  maturities, ie one month  versus six months, on the  same index as, say, GBP Libor:  the so-called  basis . After the  crisis of 2008, this difference  has increased and reached  historically high levels. The   basis differential effectively  reflects the preference, from  a bank s point of view, to lend  money for shorter maturities  and their willingness to  charge less in comparison  with longer maturities.   In practical terms, it means  that companies that have a  choice (usually determined in  standard facility agreements)  could take advantage of the  basis by switching their loans  from semi-annual to monthly  periods. This simple election  reduces immediately the  rate companies pay on their  borrowings by up to 23 basis  points, which on a £100m, five- year loan equates to savings on  interest of more than £1.1m.   but also that the company  would then pay the fixed  rate on the swap plus a  floating rate (corresponding  to the negative level). The  presence of floors on loans  and the current interest-rate  environment have therefore  introduced inconsistency  and asymmetry between  the debt s and the hedge s  flows, resulting in hedge  ineffectiveness and in  additional costs.  So, what are the solutions  for companies that are  sensitive to earnings  volatility and do not want  or can t ignore this issue?  Companies can buy a 0%  floor (effectively  buy it back ,  since they initially  sold it  to  their lender) and embed it  into the swap. These  swaps  plus floors  are, however,  not considered as a standard  product and the assumptions  used to calculate their price  differ significantly from bank  to bank; they also come at a  significant cost, even if they  are not in the money, or if  they have no intrinsic value.  Consequently, the pricing of   swaps plus floors  should be  carefully monitored, as they  can be very expensive if priced  inefficiently. This is especially  the case when longer  maturities are required.  Alternatively, for companies  that are reluctant to (over)   pay to buy back the floor,  some good results can be  achieved by structuring the  hedge with a 0% cap. The idea  is that the 0% cap, together  with the 0% floor on the loan,  creates a synthetic swap (at  a rate given by the cost of the  cap deferred over time). This  solution solves the issue of  the embedded floors from  a risk management point of  view (ie obtaining an effective  hedge, which fixes the interest  expense of the debt), and is  also very efficient in terms   of pricing (usually cheaper  than a swap plus floor for  indices with a liquid option  market). However, given the  peculiarity of its structure,   Treasurers need not despair:   there are still ways to optimise   the risk management strategies  pricing models for options,  and it directly affects the  derivative s price.   In recent months, we   have seen a switch away from  options, as they ve become  relatively more expensive to  account for the high volatility  of the market. There are,  however, companies that  have a preference, or a need,  to hedge with options, for  example, companies that   can t take the settlement   risk for a swap terminated  early on refinancing, or   highly cyclical companies   that need to reduce their  interest costs when the  economy slows down (hence  usually opting for caps).   In these cases, treasurers   need not despair: there are  still ways to optimise the   risk management strategies   in view of a company s   specific requirements, by  selecting the hedging strategy  (such as product, index  or maturity) that is most  appropriate for the current  market conditions.

BUT ARE TREASURY ROLES AT RISK? LESLEY MEALL INVESTIGATES  48  The Treasurer June 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer   It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Over the past decade,  crises in banking, credit,   the euro and sovereign debt  have formed some very dark  clouds, but their silver linings  have highlighted the tactical  and strategic importance of  efficient cash and liquidity  management, the mitigation  of risk and the need to  optimise resources, save time  and improve transparency    accelerating trends towards  greater use of specialist  software and systems in many  areas of corporate treasury.    Increased automation  in treasury has become a  strategic objective for Cairn  Energy,” says Robert Scriven,  the energy company s group  treasurer and planning  manager; and Cairn is   not alone.    We want to ensure that  our treasury processes are as  efficient and as automated   as possible,” says Guy Morgan,  treasurer for Australia s  Export Finance and Insurance  Corporation, which recently  opted for a cloud-based  treasury management system  (from Reval).  Our goal is to  have end-to-end workflow on  a single platform to eliminate  manual intervention,” says  Morgan, enabling straight- through processing (STP)   of payments.   Meanwhile, Cairn Energy  has improved STP on the  back of its installation,  identifying a need for  trade through trading,  confirmation, payment and   so on, says Scriven. But there  are challenges.  Suppliers are  not well integrated and this   is particularly difficult outside   FX, where auto quoting and  trading are less developed,”   he explains.  Intelligent software At MAHLE Industries,  the entire multifaceted  processing of remittance  advices   many of which  arrive by email   has been  automated. The global  automotive supplier has  implemented a solution  that uses specialist software  (eFLOW from Top Image  Systems) to automatically  identify, extract, classify  and verify the relevant   information from these  payment advice emails  and then deliver this  electronically, directly into  the FinanceSuite AutoBank  Automatic Cash Application  (an SAP add-on from Hanse  Orga), which has built-in  intelligent reconciliation  logic for bank statements,  remittance advices and   lockbox information.   We are happy to have  been able to automate these  processes,” says John Nielsen,  MAHLE Industries  treasurer.  The project has enabled the  company and its finance   function to save time and  improve efficiency, he says.   The previous remittance  advice processing was  dominated by tedious manual  tasks,” he recalls.  The time  savings we have experienced  due to the project have been  so significant that our finance  staff now has time to focus  on more value-adding tasks,”  he adds.  As software and systems  become smarter and able  to exchange information  more easily, the potential  for replacing manual and  semi-manual processes that  once required people, with  entirely automated processes,  is increasing. We are already  seeing use of software-based  robot process automation  (see box, opposite) in some  treasury activities and more  may follow suit. But does  this mean that treasurers are  heading down the slippery  slope towards extinction?  Can all treasury activities and  complex processes potentially  be automated? Might smart  software one day replace the  entire treasury function?  As with many such big  questions, perspectives and  answers tend to vary based   on who you ask.   Robot replacement Daniel Wong, formerly  global treasury manager at  British American Tobacco  (BAT) and now BAT business  development manager  (M&A), says:  I think there is  definitely potential to replace  some activities in the near  future, but not all.”   Recent research from  Oxford University and  Deloitte, From Brawn to      www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer June 2016 The Treasurer  49  Machine learning uses  computer algorithms that can  learn and make predications  of data.  It s not a new  concept. We ve already seen  many applications around  automated stock markets   and in the medical industry,  to name but a few,” says   Sallinen. Potential  applications for corporate  treasury vary from self- learning cash forecasting    to detection of payment fraud  anomalies. The latter is a  good example: treasury has   a key role in mitigating   cash-flow-related crime  attempts, but to mitigate  the risks, you need high- quality payment processes  and the capacity to monitor  flows, then make necessary  adjustments to the strictness  of your payment processes.  This undertaking is a   Dawn of the machine  We are seeing the dawning  of machine learning in  corporate treasury,” says  Jukka Sallinen, a cash  management domain expert  at OpusCapita, a financial  process automation specialist.   Software robots are good in  automating simple repeatable  processes where you deal with  masses of transactions,” says  Sallinen.  Many treasury tasks   are more complex by nature,”  he adds.   The combination of  robot process automation  and machine learning now  emerging will create many  new possibilities, because  machine learning can   help with the automation   of complex decisions   that cannot be done   solely using rule-based  process automation.  Brains, predicts a bleak future  for finance and accounting  professionals in many  areas, and treasury seems  unlikely to be immune. But  can all treasury processes  follow accounts payable and  receivable down the road  towards robot automation?    Some activities are already  being performed by robots  today,” Wong says.  It s  easy to see this in the cash  management and payment  space where you can have  robots recognising patterns  that do cash allocation and  general ledger clearings  and postings. In the risk  management space, it s also  easy to see that robots or  programs can consolidate   and analyse data very quickly.”  In the near future, there  may be little need for big  teams of people to manually  manipulate data.  In the  dealing space, there can be  algorithms that can be run  to manage small positions as  and when they arise,” he adds.   So perhaps the direction of  travel is clear; perhaps not.   I think there is a lot of  complexity in treasury that  makes it hard to completely  remove a human s touch,”  says Wong. For example,  managing sanctions,   responding to changing  regulations and making  strategic decisions on  funding and risk appetite.   All these things will require  judgement, although these  decisions can be aided by  robots,” he says. Time will tell:  it may be the next generation  of automation that radically  reshapes treasury, rather than  current incarnations of robot  process automation.   Lesley Meall is a freelance  journalist specialising in  technology and finance  Does this mean that treasurers are heading down the  slippery slope towards extinction? Can all treasury activities  and complex processes potentially be automated?   mountain for a person, but  it s a molehill for a robot.    Machine-learning  algorithms can be introduced  to alert and stop exceptional  flows,” says Sallinen. In  fraud detection, no matter  how knowledgeable or  experienced a person is, they  are pitting their wits against  an algorithm that is built  on a model containing huge  numbers of past transactions  and variables, along with  their potentially myriad  correlations.  This means the  model is much more powerful  and able to catch suspicious  flows at an earlier stage than  a human,” he adds. So the  model has a much greater  potential than a person or   a team to help with the  mitigation of risks in  corporate payment processes.  Where does this leave  treasurers?  Technology is  advancing at a rapid pace and  it s important to keep on top  of the trends,” says Robert  Waddington, a director in  PwC s corporate treasury and  commodities group. When  it recently identified eight  technology trends that could  impact future treasury teams1,  the list was topped by robotic  processing and data analytics,  vital components in the next  generation of smart systems.   Services around machine  learning and artificial  intelligence in treasury and  cash management remain  largely at pilot stage. Treasury  professionals with an eye on  the future will want to watch  this space.   What are software robots? Hollywood has helped  shape our perceptions  of the future and robots.  However, as Raheem  Hasan, president of the  Institute for Robotic  Process Automation,  explains, the reality   of software robots is  rather different.   A software robot  or robotic process  automation is the  application of technology  or computer software  that can be configured  to capture, interpret  and interact with  existing applications for  processing transactions,  manipulating data,   triggering responses  and communicating with  other digital systems,” he  explains. Their potential  scope is vast.  Large-scale users  of knowledge workers  can leverage software  robots or robotic  full- time equivalents  to  perform high-volume  transactional processes,  at a fraction of the cost of  people.  Just as industrial  robots are remaking the  manufacturing industry,  software robots are  revolutionising the way  that knowledge work gets  done,” he adds. This is just  the beginning.  1 www.pwc.blogs.com/finance_and_ treasury/2016/01/trends-in-technology.html    BUILD TALENT TO DELIVER  YOUR BUSINESS GOALS  Pick and choose from any of our learning   products, solutions and commercially relevant   programmes.

Similarly,   it has been expected that the  management of staff expertise  would include investment in  further training and hiring of  new staff with particular skills.  This is, of course, a huge  cost to business, but one  seen as essential. What has  previously been overlooked  has been any consideration  of how to better manage the  staff s existing mental capital.  If your company has a number  of talented individuals hired  for their particular expertise,  who are not working to their  capacity, this is a huge waste  of human talent and a missed  opportunity to accelerate their  potential   and therefore the  growth of the company.   The view has been that the  soft stuff   how people are  managed within the workplace    was somehow less relevant  or important to business  than technical knowledge.  This view might have been  applicable in the industrial  era, but it has no place in the  modern workplace.  The human species has  been so remarkably successful  because of both our ability  to adapt to change in our  environment and our ability   to connect with each other.   We are social beings,  hardwired to flourish through  working and living with  others. It is our relationships  that matter above everything  else   the relationships we  have with our family and  friends, our acquaintances   and work colleagues.   In business, relationships  with customers are only  one facet of the social web  of connection we enjoy.  Our future success and  happiness as individuals and  organisations depends on our  ability to form, nurture and  maintain our relationships.

Today, the pace of change  and the introduction of new  ideas and technology is so fast,  it can be difficult to find the  time to absorb and assimilate  what could be most useful  to us before the next round  of advances and upgrades  arrive on our doorstep. Which  is why it can sometimes be  tempting to keep the door  closed, hunker down and hope  everyone will leave you alone  until you are ready to come   up and draw breath.  Choosing to invest in the  mental capital and wellbeing  of every staff member is the  obvious path to responsible  organisational health. The  Foresight Mental Capital and  Wellbeing project, produced  by the Government Office for  Science in London, concludes:  If we are to prosper and  thrive in our changing  society and in an increasingly  interconnected and competitive  world, both our mental and  material resources will be vital.  Encouraging and enabling  everyone to realise their  potential throughout their lives  will be crucial for our future  prosperity and wellbeing… An  individual s mental capital  and mental wellbeing crucially  affect their path through life.  Moreover, they are vitally  important for the healthy  functioning of families,  communities and society.  Together, they fundamentally  affect behaviour, social  cohesion, social inclusion and  our prosperity.  What is implied is that, as  individuals, we can expect to  take greater responsibility for  our own health and wellbeing,  as well as ensuring that our   • Lack of trust; • Lack of relatedness; • Lack of collaboration; • Lack of innovation; and • Lack of effective leadership.  There is a lot of  sickness    in many of today s workplaces,  which ultimately leads  to a loss of integrity and  organisational health.   Lencioni is right. Restoring  organisational health has to  start with going back to the  basics of creating a healthy  brain capable of consistently  thinking well, with less effort,  even when under pressure.  People today live and work  under an incredible amount  of pressure. Having to juggle  multiple, often complex, tasks  with the perception of time  poverty stresses us out. This   in turn can compromise  mental performance.  Organisational health   is about making sure that:  • You feel you have the   capability to do your work  and do it well;  • You can enjoy what you  spend so much of your time  doing; and  • You feel you have enough  time and energy at the end  of the day to devote to those  things that give you pleasure  and mean most to you.  Media business  commentators, such as Alan  Kohler in Australia, love  to discuss the reasons why  various businesses are or   are not performing well.   A commentator will note   the links between profit  margins, profit forecasts   and ASX performance, but  until fairly recently, there   has been little research into  which specific elements of  human behaviour contribute  to high performance.   A study published by  the Society for Knowledge  Economics in 2011 revealed  some fascinating insights   into what makes the    This is an edited extract from Future Brain:   The 12 Keys to Create Your High Performance  Brain, by Dr Jenny Brockis (Wiley, 2016)  biggest difference to how   well a business performs.  Cutting through all the  business-speak, Steven   Vamos, president of the  Society for Knowledge  Economics, summarised   its findings nicely:   The study shows that  leaders in higher-performing  organisations prioritise   people management as   a key priority, involve their  people in decision-making  processes; are more responsive  to customer and stakeholder  needs; encourage a high degree  of responsiveness to change  and learning orientation,  and enable their staff to fully  use their skills and abilities  at work. High-performing  organisations are not just  much more profitable and  productive, they also perform  better in many important   intangible attributes ,   such as encouraging  innovation, leadership of their  people, and creating a fair  workplace environment.  From the survey of more  than 5,600 employees from 78  Australian organisations who  participated in this study, it  was revealed that the highest- performing workplaces  enjoyed a 12% higher level of  productivity, which translated  into a profit margin roughly  three times higher than found  in low-performing workplaces.  The key differences were  all derived from human  interaction and behaviour.  How we think and how we  work as a consequence are  hugely influenced by our  mood, health and interactions  with others.  Humans think and feel. It s  time to put the humanity back  into how we choose to live our  lives and do our work.   needs and agendas are being  appropriately taken care of in  our lives and at work. From an  organisation s viewpoint, this  is about developing greater  inclusivity, responsiveness  and openness to conversations  around performance   and development.   So what is  mental capital ?  The Foresight Group defines  it as the combination of  cognitive ability (mental  flexibility and efficiency)  and emotional intelligence  (dealing effectively with stress,  resilience and social skills).   It defines  mental wellbeing    as a dynamic state in which   an individual can develop  their potential, build strong  and positive relationships, and  contribute to the community.   Mental capital implies a  value base, which ties in nicely  with the idea that brains  matter and that growing  brains to work at their best  makes perfect economic sense.  Growing healthy  workplaces leads   to high performance  Organisational health,”   writes Patrick Lencioni in   his book The Advantage,    will one day surpass all other  disciplines in business as  the greatest opportunity for  improvement and competitive  advantage.” He defines  organisational health as the  integration of management,  operations, strategy and  culture. Sure, business needs  strategy, marketing, finance  and technology, but it also  needs to deal with those  people issues poisoning   so many workplaces: • Bullying; • Micromanagement; • Poor communication    or, worse still, lack   of communication;  • Confusion around  expectation;  • Silo mentality; • Change resistance;  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer June 2016 The Treasurer  53       54  The Treasurer June 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  The cause of public- speaking anxiety is  uncertainty. In fact,    the cause of all anxiety can   be traced back to feelings   of uncertainty.  This simple principle helps  us master public speaking  because it breaks us out of  vague thoughts about  feeling  uncomfortable  and helps  us focus on specific actions:   What am I uncertain about,  and what can I do about it?”  It s perfectly natural to  be nervous in the face of a  public-speaking assignment.  Knowing how to process our  nervous symptoms is the  key to thinking clearly under  pressure of the spotlight.  So what should we focus   on first to reduce uncertainty?  The curator of TED Talks,  Chris Anderson, recently  spoke about what he s learned  from watching thousands  of great TED Talks. He said  there is no single formula,   but there is a common cause     a desire to  transfer into  your listeners  minds a gift,   a strange and beautiful object,  that we call an idea”.   That s the basic focus I ve  been teaching would-be  public speakers for more    Behavioural skills Self management accountability  Myth 1: Your body language  is more important than  your words This is the biggest myth and  it underpins the acting and  performance approach to  public speaking. But it s not  true. The only time your body  language is more important  than your words is when it  contradicts your words.   When you are clear on your  message and comfortable  in your own style, there s  little chance you ll have  contradictory body language.  It will flow naturally as you  speak. Sure, public-speaking  anxiety can make it more  difficult to focus than normal,  but when you know how to  redirect your attention, even  this will dissolve.  Myth 2: You must eliminate  nerves to be a great speaker No, you don t. Many people  have a niggling thought:    than 15 years. The route to  success in public speaking is  message transfer. Distil your  idea into a key message and  embed it into the mind of  your audience.  There are many ways to  achieve this and it can be  done using an unlimited  number of unique styles.  Regrettably, most public- speaking training has been  complicated, with a focus on  a narrow set of performance  skills   acting, body language,  gestures, eye-contact  techniques, PowerPoint   slides and so on.   This kind of public- speaking training advocates  that you prioritise  performance skills over  bringing ideas to life, so  natural style gets crushed.  People bounce out of   public-speaking courses   with a robotic, mechanical  delivery that hinders their  ability to relax and connect  with the audience. And when  our mind is cluttered with  rules, tips and techniques,   we find it harder to think  clearly and explain our   ideas effectively.  So, let s dissolve the myths  that arise…  First, bring your  ideas to life NERVES ARE NORMAL WHEN WE ARE PUT  IN THE SPOTLIGHT OF PUBLIC SPEAKING.  FOCUSING ON YOUR IDEAS AND MESSAGES  IS THE KEY TO OVERCOMING THEM.  CAM BARBER EXPLAINS   If I was a good speaker,   I wouldn t get nervous. But  I do get nervous, so I m not  good enough.”  The reality is, it s normal  to feel speaking anxiety, no  matter how experienced   you are.  Entrepreneur Richard  Branson admits he gets  nervous in public-speaking  situations and has done since  he was a teenager. Watch  him speak. He looks a little  awkward, but so what? The  nerves haven t held him back;  he s one of the most sought- after speakers on the planet.  People want to hear his ideas.  Myth 3: Bad first  impressions can t   be overcome Of course they can! Have  you heard that audiences  form their lasting impression  in the first 30 seconds? Or  even that they do so the first   SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K    eight seconds? This is very  misleading. It implies that  the lasting impression of your  presentation won t be your  wisdom, the clarity of your  message or the relevance of  your information, but that it  all rests on your performance  in the first few seconds.   What pressure! The fact  is that public speaking is  not as hard as all that, or as  mysterious. No matter what  happened in the first 30  seconds, engage your audience  with subsequent impressions  and they will be left with a  positive overall impression.  Here are some key  principles to master public  speaking and dissolve  speaking anxiety.  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer June 2016 The Treasurer  55  • Write down what you  want them to think or do  as a result of your talk (for  example,  This project  will succeed , or  Use this  procedure every time you  do X ).  • Write down why your  audience would do or think  what you have suggested  (for example,  …because of  X, Y and Z , or  because it  will improve productivity  and reduce mistakes ).  Now combine steps two  and three, and you have a  draft of your vivid message.  For instance:  This project will  succeed because of X, Y and Z.    Use this procedure every  time you do X, because it will  improve productivity and  reduce mistakes.   Of course, you still have  to explain the details of your  idea; but the only way your  listeners will remember   the details a day later is  through the doorway of   your vivid message.  2. Structure your ideas The best way to structure   your ideas is to break them  down into two, three or   four chunks. The human  mind can t remember more  than five things without   a memory device.   Structuring your ideas  is the way to keep people  engaged and progressively  bring your idea to life.  The most-watched speech  in history is Steve Jobs    Stanford Commencement  speech . It s divided into three  stories and a wrap-up. You  can look at the breakdown   of his structure at   www.vividmethod.com/  speech-outline-for-  steve-jobs-stanford- commencement-address  Cam Barber is a  speaker, speaking  coach and speechwriter  Structure your knowledge  into a series of presentations.  Create presentations that  simplify your knowledge  and deliver them in the  workplace. For example,   what are the three steps to  getting something done or  the four stages to achieving  a goal? Packaging your  knowledge helps other people  recognise it, and use it. The  better you are at doing this,  the more value you offer the  world and the more success  you will have.  3. Redirect your attention  when under pressure The stress response is  designed to help us   to prime  our body to deal with an  important event. However,  the adrenaline that is released  to give you energy to deal  with your speaking event can  create physical symptoms,  such as shaking, blushing,  sweating and so on.   But these symptoms aren t  the problem. The way we  react to them is the key to  dissolving them. Redirect  your attention to something  that helps you focus, such as  breathing comfortably.  And when you understand  that message transfer is the  key measure of your success  when speaking in public,   you see that people will  accept you with your  imperfections. Direct your  attention to bringing your  message to life and speak in  a style that is comfortable    your natural style.  So, keep your eye on the  public-speaking prize   focus  on compelling messages and  natural style   and you ll have  twice the impact with half   the effort.   1. Craft a vivid message Great leaders talk in  messages. Steve Jobs, the  late Apple CEO, was a great  speaker and a master at  messaging. For example,   the message for the iPod   was  A thousand songs in   your pocket . It s simple   and memorable.   When people listened   to a Steve Jobs presentation,  they all came away with the  same key message. This is no  accident. He always started  with the message   and built  his presentation from there.  So, here are three steps to  crafting a vivid message: • Clear your mind of the   details and look into the  mind of your audience.  When you understand that message transfer is   the key measure of your success, you see that  people will accept you with your imperfections         Business skills Qualifications  Money for money Currency dealing means exchanging money for money. Does simple  multiplication work for currency deals? Sometimes, but not all the  time. It depends which way round the rate is quoted.  For FX, we need to ask two separate questions: (1) Which is the base currency in the given quote? (2) Are we converting from the base, or to the base?  Which is the base currency? The base currency won t always be the same. For example, the rate  between dollars and euros can be quoted as either:   (i) A variable number of dollars per €1; or  (ii) A variable number of euros per $1.  €/$1.25 The first-mentioned currency is  conventionally the base. That s euros in this  case. The euro is the currency that there s one  fixed unit of.  This is quoted in the market as EUR/USD 1.25,   meaning the base currency euro would be  exchanged for dollars at a rate of €1 to $1.25.  Best of order Note the ordering of the currencies in the exchange-rate quote.   We saw that the first-mentioned currency is the base.   This is a different convention from commodity prices, such as   dollars per barrel = 50. For a commodity, it s the second-mentioned  item that is the base. In our example, this is the barrel of oil.  Currencies are conventionally quoted the other way round. This  can make FX tricky.  $/€0.80 Taking another example: which is the base currency in the quote  USD/EUR 0.80?  56  The Treasurer June 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer   FX is such an important part of a treasurer s responsibilities that it appears in most assessments for the ACT s qualifications. Multiplying troubles A recent Examiner s Report shows many candidates need to brush  up their FX conversion skills.  The commonest error was to multiply by the exchange rate where  division was required.  Examiner s Report, International Cash Management, October 2015  Back to basics Exchanging one currency for another needs us to apply a quoted  market price, known as the exchange rate. Sometimes we need to  multiply by the rate. Sometimes we need to divide by it.  It all depends on how the rate has been quoted. And this won t  always be the same.  Money for stuff Pricing is easier when we re buying or selling physical stuff for money.  We simply multiply the quantity by the money price per unit.  Let s say the oil price is $50 per barrel, and we want to sell a million  barrels. The money value for the exchange is simply:  $50 per barrel x 1 million barrels = $50m  Why we multiplied We multiply by commodity prices because  of the way they re quoted. The commodity  quote is a variable amount of money per fixed  conventional unit of the commodity.   Oil prices are quoted in dollars per barrel. So,  multiplying a number of barrels by dollars per  barrel gives the dollar value for the exchange.  The oil is the basis, or the  base  of the  conventional oil-price quote.  BASE  JUMPER EXCHANGING FOREIGN CURRENCY IS AN ESSENTIAL PRACTICAL TASK, WHICH  ALL TREASURERS NEED TO TACKLE WITH CONFIDENCE. DOUG WILLIAMSON  SHARES A WINNING TECHNIQUE TO ENSURE YOU GET IT RIGHT EVERY TIME  Oil deal base = oil  Exchange deal base = ?    Again, the base currency is the first mentioned. In this case it s the  dollar. So the quote USD/EUR 0.80 means $1 would be exchanged  for €0.80.  Interestingly, $/€0.80 is just an alternative way of expressing our  earlier quote €/$1.25. The base has jumped from euro to dollar, but it  won t make any difference to the results. So long as we apply either of  the quotes correctly, they will each produce exactly the same results,  subject to any minor rounding differences. Base jumping is also an  exciting extreme sport. But let s stay with FX just now.  Getting it right Having identified the base currency in our exchange rate, we need   to apply it the right way round. One reliable method is to follow   the rule in the following:  Base conversion rule  When converting: • From the base, multiply. • To the base, divide.  From the base To convert from the base currency, we multiply by the exchange rate.  Just like multiplying to apply a commodity price. Indeed, our base  currency can be viewed as the commodity in the quote.  Say we need to convert €8m into dollars, by applying the exchange  rate EUR/USD 1.25.  The euro is the base currency. We re converting from the base.   So multiply:  €8m x $1.25 per euro = $10m  To the base The recent exam question needed a conversion to the base currency.  This caused difficulty for many candidates.  Simplifying the numbers in the exam, candidates needed to  convert €8m into dollars, using an exchange rate of USD/EUR 0.80.  Try this example now, before reading the rest of the article.  Work it on out The base currency in the quote USD/EUR 0.80 is the dollar. The  quote means $1 = €0.80.  We re converting from €8m to dollars. So we re converting to the  base currency dollars this time. So, we ll divide by the exchange rate  of 0.80:  €8m/€0.80 per dollar = $10m  Congratulations if you got it right! If you didn t, don t be discouraged.  Perfect proportions If we tabulate our results, we see that each currency stays beautifully  in proportion with the other.     $ €  FX rate 1 0.80  Amounts 10m 8m  There are more dollars than euros in the rate $1/€0.80. There are  also more dollars than euros in the final money amounts, $10m  exchanged for €8m.  Why did candidates go wrong?  Possible reasons include: • Not being familiar with the currency pair; • Being more used to seeing it quoted the other way round, with    euros as the base; • Exchange rates of less than 1 are trickier; and • Not practising enough.  Don t be disheartened Listen to this excellent advice from a successful student,   George Worden: 1. Don t be disheartened if you get the wrong answers to start with. 2. First focus on getting right answers. 3. Once you re getting things right, only then work on speeding up. 4. Practice makes perfect.  Reap the rewards If you follow Worden s advice you ll master FX and treasury, which  are just as rewarding as base jumping. And less dangerous.

Thank you for taking a day  out of your busy schedule for  this one-on-one workshop   on stress in the workplace.”  Taking a day out of his busy  schedule for a one-on-one  workshop on stress in the  workplace was exactly the   sort of thing that would give   Mr Treasurer workplace  stress. But   needs must,  diktat from above. Curses.  It was Strickard-Folley s  fault, of course   poor chap    though he had rather brought  it upon himself. One Tuesday  afternoon, the boys and girls  in the post room came back  from lunch almost 11 minutes  late   and two or maybe three  of the team appeared to have  the smell of alcohol on their  breath. Young Scuggins, the  apprentice postage-stamp  clerk, had been sharing a  little of his joy at having put  a tenner on Leicester City  Football Club last autumn   at 2,500/1. Young Scuggins  wasn t feeling stressed at   all   and after spending   11 minutes too many at The  Shiny Sixpence public house,  neither were the rest of the  post-room team.   When Strickard-Folley,  the facilities manager, ticked  them off, Scuggins got it into  his lager-and-cash-fuelled  head that it would be a fine  idea to stuff Strickard-Folley  into a cardboard box, tape   it shut and have him  couriered to a suburb of  Samarkand, in eastern   58  The Treasurer June 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  After several long minutes   thought, he replied,  Cash- pooling arrangements in  Turkey.” His one-on-one  stress counsellor had no   idea what that meant, but   it sounded awfully technical.  She was thrilled to bits.   Ah!” she almost shrieked.   Difficult concepts,  complicated financial tricks,  challenging to master all the  details, no support from your  line manager, stressed  ” (she  stressed the word  stressed )     about losing millions of the  company s money and that  a culture of blame will come  raining down on you?”   Er, no,” said Mr Treasurer.   Sorry, no. Not at all.”    IN THIS  ISSUE:  MONTH END  Uzbekistan. Scuggins   employment was swiftly  curtailed. Strickard-Folley  was recovered from the box  long before the courier firm  arrived to take it away, but his  nerves had been put through  the post-room shredder.   Faced with the choice  of issuing a company-wide  missive on stuffing other  people into boxes and trying  to courier them to Asia on  the one hand, or organising a  series of one-on-one stress in  the workplace workshops on  the other, the decision seemed  obvious to the HR director.   So, what causes you to  experience stress in the  workplace, Mr Treasurer?”  Workplace stress?

He is a former editor  of Financial Director  and has worked on  Accountancy Age,  Business Age and  Commercial Lawyer.  He tweets as   @Mr_Numbers  Sportingly, he felt as though  he was rather letting the side  down by not being stressed  about such things.  We  don t have any cash-pooling  arrangements in Turkey.”  To say she looked stressed  would be a slur on her  reputation as a professional  stress counsellor, but she was  definitely unrelaxed.   It s just that my phone  rings goodness knows how  many times a week with  advisers and consultants of  all sorts trying to persuade  me to buy into suchlike  arrangements,” he explained.   The point is, we don t have  any businesses in Turkey.”  He leaned forward slightly.   But my busy schedule is  constantly interrupted by   professionals  trying to get  me to do things I don t need  to do.”  There was silence. Quite a  lot of silence, actually. She got  the hint.  Well, thank you,  Mr Treasurer. I think that was  a very successful workshop.  Let s just tick this one off   the list, shall we? No need   to reconvene after lunch.”  Mr Treasurer cleared his  throat.

Whether you re a delegate coming to take the opportunity to discuss the latest trends in  treasury, to catch up with former colleagues or enjoy the thought-provoking speaker programme     and hopefully for all of those reasons   the conference offers a welcoming environment in which  to refresh your knowledge and contacts.   Last year s conference in Manchester, for instance, attracted 1,100 delegates from more than  400 companies and 35 different countries   a truly international crowd. This year s event speakers  include respected treasurers from multinationals, along with Lady Barbara Judge, chair of the  Institute of Directors, economist John Kay and broadcaster Mishal Husain.  This year, we are equipping you in advance of the conference with the ACT s latest research  into treasurers  attitudes towards their role and the impact of the treasury discipline on corporate  financial strategy and business growth. The Contemporary Treasurer, which is the only completely  independent and global study of treasurers  perspectives on their role, begins on page 29 of this  issue. It demonstrates, among many other notable points, that treasurers are spending increasing  amounts of time on higher-level strategic issues and that they are becoming more and more  recognised as valued advisers to their boards.  Elsewhere in the issue, business journalist James Ashton talks to Andrew Koss, chief executive  at UK power station Drax. Koss, who has held various positions, including treasurer, head of  corporate finance and investor relations, took the helm of the power station s treasury function  during a hard-fought restructuring exercise. Today, Drax is forging a path towards renewable  energy with biomass-fuelled generators, an evolution that has meant an entirely new supply chain  and vast capital investment, requiring the support of both lenders and backers. Koss talks about  his experiences, and the strong foundation that his treasury qualifications gave him, on page 20.  Staying within the industrial landscape, business journalist Paul Golden takes a look at project  finance on page 24 and finds keen capital market appetite for infrastructure exposure. We also  take a look at a community housing not-for-profit s transformational treasury management  system installation on page 40.

According to S&P s second  annual league table for private  placement deals, 2015 saw a total  of €12.8bn in transactions and 146  deals for mid-market companies.  Findings also show issuance  of private funding for companies  in the pan-European private  placement market and German  Schuldschein growing 78% to  €32.8bn in 2015, up from €18.4bn  the previous year.  Alternative European financing  markets are, according to the report,   growing at the expense of the US  private placement market, which  lost ground last year. Additionally,  overall bank lending volumes  also fell. As market participants  across Europe work to harmonise  private placement documentation,  so investors are becoming more  familiar with this asset class, the  study s authors argue.  In terms of deal volume, Morgan  Stanley dominates with €2.2bn  placed last year. Crédit Agricole is  second with €1.6bn and Rabobank  is third with €1.3bn.  Crédit Agricole made 20 deals  over the course of 2015, followed by  Natixis with 18 deals, and Société  Générale, which made 16 deals.  The French euro private  placement market remains the  largest, with €4.9bn in deal volumes  and 38% of total European private  placement volume. Belgium  has 14% of the European private  placement market, while Italy has  a 13% share. The UK s share by  volume is 7%.  The number of deals above  €150m rose from eight in 2014 to 21  last year, representing 46% of total  deal volumes for 2015, compared  with 28% for 2014.  The volume of deals with longer  maturities also grew. Deals with  tenors of 11-15 years grew to €0.8bn  last year, up from €0.1bn the  previous year.

According to a study from FX  platform World First, a combined  £35.6bn of FX exposures is  potentially at risk from currency  movements for the first three  months of this year.   Meanwhile, nearly one quarter of  UK SMEs (24%) felt negative effects  from exchange-rate fluctuations  during the period, and 15% said  currency volatility had affected the  investment decisions that would  support growth.  While UK SMEs have  traditionally protected themselves   with long-term forward contracts to  hedge against currency movements,  data from the World First SME  Global Trade Barometer shows   a majority bucking this trend due  to fears over a UK exit from the  EU. In spite of a 75% increase in  sterling volatility, many SMEs have  only extended the length of their  protection by 35% across the same  period, leaving many companies  unhedged over what is expected to  be a time of considerable volatility  following the vote on 23 June.  Concerns around currency  volatility look set to continue, with  55% expecting continued sterling  volatility over Q2 2016.  Jeremy Cook, chief economist  at World First, said:  The fear is   that, by failing to hedge themselves  much beyond 23 June, many   UK SMEs are putting themselves   at the mercy of large currency  swings, which could be   detrimental to their business   and the wider economy.”  While sterling volatility is a  continuing challenge, UK-based  SMEs expect revenues from exports  to continue growing, according to a  report from Lloyds Bank. Some 43%  of those surveyed grew their exports  over the second half of last year,  with only 17% seeing a decrease in  exports. Lloyds  Business in Britain  report surveys 1,500 UK companies.  Among its findings, 37% of  respondents predicted an uplift   in sales to Europe.  SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K  WORDS     { CONTEXT OF TREASURY }  Corporate corruption and  terrorist finance targeted   in wide-ranging Home  Office action plan  In wide-ranging changes to the UK s anti-money- laundering regime, regulators and enforcers look set   to acquire new powers to tackle the flow of illegal funds. Described as the most far-reaching changes in a   decade, the proposals   set out in a UK government  Action Plan for anti-money laundering and counter- terrorist finance   include a range of measures to  improve the effectiveness of official responses to  suspicious activity.  These measures have implications for corporations   in both the non-financial and financial sectors.  Watchdogs would be granted new powers to  designate a corporate entity  of money-laundering  concern”, and require that entity s business partners   to take  special measures” when dealing with it.  The plan also calls for a reform of the UK s suspicious- activities reporting regime, which currently requires  regulated corporate players to flag up any unusual  patterns to the National Crime Agency (NCA).  Under the regime, resources for addressing suspect  transactions would be improved to include greater  information sharing between companies and officials.  Meanwhile, the NCA will receive new powers, such   as the ability to issue Unexplained Wealth Orders to  those suspected of money laundering.  { FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT }  Card data primary target   for cybercriminals   A forensic study into  2015 online security   breaches has found card  payment information   to be the number one  objective for hackers.  In 60% of cases,  attackers were after  payment card data,  according to a survey  of hundreds of breach  investigations carried   out by cybersecurity  company Trustwave. Out  of those cyberattacks,  criminals were found to be  targeting both magnetic  card track data, coming  mainly from point-of-sale  environments (POS),   and card-not-present   data, mainly from  e-commerce transactions.  Retailers were the most  compromised sector,  making up 23% of the  investigations, followed  by hospitality businesses  at 14%, and the food and  beverage industry at 10%.  The study also found a  shift in the environments  and networks under  attack. Compromises  affecting corporate  and internal networks  increased to 40% in 2015,  up from 18% in 2014. Some  38% of investigations  were into e-commerce  breaches, compared with  42% in 2014, while 22%   were POS breaches. POS  compromises decreased  18 percentage points from  2014 to 2015, making  up 40% of Trustwave  investigations in 2014.  The report reveals shifts  in spam subjects. In 2014,  pharmaceutical product  spam made up almost  three quarters of spam  messages. However, that  dropped to 39% in 2015.  The survey covered  security breaches from  17 countries. Some  35% occurred in North  America; 21% in Asia  Pacific; 12% in Europe, the  Middle East and Africa;  and 10% in Latin America.  NUMBERS   Growth has been too slow for too long.

Bank of England   Brexit warning Key markets that support  corporate investment could  be destabilised in the wake  of a Vote Leave success in  the EU referendum, the  Bank of England s Financial  Policy Committee (FPC)  has warned.  In a statement from  its most recent policy  meeting, the FPC said that   heightened uncertainty”   around the UK s territorial  status, which has already  begun to emerge, will  become particularly testing  around the time of the poll.  In the event of a pro-Brexit  result, the Committee  cautioned that uncertainty  could place a strain on   core funding avenues that  have already shown signs   of fragility.  IMF issues gloomy  outlook report The International Monetary  Fund s (IMF s) twice-yearly  assessment of the global  economy did little to cheer  markets and commentators.  The World Economic  Outlook put its global  growth forecast for 2016   at 3.2%, down 0.2% from  its January forecast, but is  significant because it puts  world economic prospects  only slightly above the   3% that the IMF has  previously referred to   as a technical recession.   Most major economies  saw their forecasts  downgraded by the IMF,  reflecting a widespread  slowdown across all types  of economies. Brazil and  Russia are now expected  to see weaker performance  than suggested by previous  predictions. However, the  forecast for India remains  unchanged at 7.5% and   the IMF expects China s  growth rate to increase   by 0.2% to 6.5%.  INTERNATIONAL BRIEFING  { CONTEXT OF TREASURY }  FINANCE  PROFESSIONALS  BULLISH ON  SPENDING   AND GROWTH  Findings from the ninth annual  American Express Global Business   and Spending Monitor saw UK  executives reporting that they have  plans to increase spending and  investment levels by 13% this year     a small proportion, but higher than   the 7% in France and Germany, and   the 6% in Russia, who say spending   and investment will increase.  UK finance professionals are more  optimistic than their continental  European counterparts about the  economic climate and expect greater  employment opportunities, according  to the survey. It found that 64% of UK  finance executives reported increased  revenues for the past 12 months, and  75% expect to see economic expansion  this year   higher than the global average  of 65% reported in the survey and  beating the European average of 62%.  However, sentiment among UK   and continental European finance  executives on plans for spending  and investment for the year is muted  compared with the global outlook,  with UK and European respondents  expecting to see significantly less  spending and investment than their  counterparts worldwide.  Meanwhile, some 87% of executives  surveyed worldwide say their companies  have plans to increase total spending  and investment in 2016. Nearly half  (49%) say they are planning increases  of 10% or more. However, companies  are still taking a cautious approach,  with market uncertainty weighing on  those plans: 61% worldwide reported  that political and economic uncertainty  in their own markets will make them  cautious about spending.  Investment in employment is also  expected to increase. Globally, executives  anticipated a 9% increase in headcount  over 2016. UK respondents also think  they will see a 9% increase, while the  average for Europe was 6%. Hiring  suitable employees is not straightforward,  however. In the UK and Germany  companies say their performance goals  have been hampered by difficulties in  hiring skilled or specialised employees,  62% and 43% respectively.  68% of finance  executives say  they will focus on  optimising cash   in the business  41% say  strengthening sales  in domestic markets  will be a priority  32% will invest  in new product or  service development  9% is the  percentage  headcount that is  expected to increase  31% will target  production  efficiency  THE STATS  { KEY FINDINGS FROM THE NINTH ANNUAL AMERICAN  EXPRESS SURVEY OF GLOBAL FINANCE LEADERS }  Saint Petersburg, Russia  SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K      www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer May 2016 The Treasurer  09  { CONTEXT OF TREASURY }  HSBC REMAINS  EUROPE S BIGGEST  BANK EVEN AFTER  MAJOR DISPOSAL  HSBC Holdings plc has held its  place as Europe s largest bank    by assets for the fourth year in   a row in rating agency Standard   & Poor s (S&P s) top 50, in spite   of the pending sale of its Brazilian  interests to Banco Bradesco SA.  London-headquartered HSBC  held €2.178 trillion in pro forma  assets as of April 2015, making   it the only European bank with  more than €2 trillion in assets.  According to S&P Global Market  Intelligence, HSBC s assets were  adjusted downward by €40.67bn   to account for the pending   disposal of HSBC Bank Brasil   Banco Múltiplo.  S&P s league table of top  European banks showed little  change at the top. BNP Paribas  remains Europe s second-largest  bank, with €1.994 trillion in assets,  down from €2.392 trillion in the  2014 league table, a decline of  17%. Crédit Agricole rose to third  position, while Barclays fell to   fifth place.  Deutsche Bank was at fourth  place for the second year with  €1.629 trillion in assets. Royal Bank  of Scotland fell from sixth place to  ninth, and ING fell from 11th place  to 13th.  Italy s Banco Popolare Società  Cooperativa was a new entry to  the top 50 list, thanks to a pending  merger with Banca Popolare di  Milano Scarl, which will add  €50.2bn in assets.  German banks feature most  heavily in the list. Germany has  seven banks in S&P s top 50, while  France, Spain and the UK all have  six banks listed.  In S&P s league table, metrics  were adjusted to take account  of all mergers, acquisitions and  divestitures, as well as any deals  that closed after the reporting  period ending April 2015. Assets  reported by non-euro filers were  converted to euros using period- end exchange rates. The majority   of banks were ranked by total   assets as of 31 December 2015.  EMEA bond and loan activity  down steeply on last year  Analysis from rating agency Moody s put  combined bond and loan issuance volumes   for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA)  down 68% for the first quarter of this year  compared with the same period in 2015.  Combined leveraged bond and loan  issuance volumes for the region totalled  $16bn for Q1 this year, compared with $50.7bn  last year, although large deals, such as with  Virgin Media, Numericable-SFR and Altice  Luxembourg, look set to more than redress   the balance.  According to Moody s, March saw strong  activity in the EMEA high-yield market,   with $6.2bn in issuance, making it the most  significant month for issuance in the year  to date. However, volumes for the month  remained 40% below March last year.  Associate MD for European leveraged  finance Peter Firth noted that Brexit is  increasingly a factor for investors in relation to  the high-yield market. UK corporates represent  a large proportion of the European high- yield market: 16.7% of European high-yield  and leveraged loan issuances since 2010 were  generated by UK companies. Moody s believes  uncertainty could constrain future issuances in  sterling or by UK companies in the near term.  G20 leaders hunt issue   interest-rate warning Global financial leaders from  G20 nations warned against   a reliance on low interest rates  as a means of returning a fragile  world economy to growth. As a  growing number of central banks  shift into negative interest-rate  territory, the G20 said monetary  policy was not a guaranteed  measure, according to a report   in the Financial Times.  At the spring meeting of the  International Monetary Fund,  finance ministers and central  bankers applauded encouraging  indicators from China, but said  weak productivity and a lack of  monetary policy firepower could  derail recovery. They also cited  potential obstacles, such as the  possible difficulty for China as it  rebalances its economy, oil prices,   disorderly capital flows, the UK s  potential exit from the EU and  continued difficulties for Greece.  ECB reports easing   lending conditions Meanwhile, the European  Central Bank (ECB) has said  that companies are seeing  improvements in lending  conditions in the euro area.  In its quarterly Bank Lending  Survey, the eurozone s central  bank reported that conditions  for corporate loans have been  relaxed and demand has risen.   Competitive pressures and  reduced risk perceptions were  the main factors contributing  to the net easing of credit  standards,” the bank said.   Saudi turns to global   bonds in $10bn deal In the face of decreasing oil  revenue and prices, Saudi  Arabia is to raise $10bn from a  consortium of global banks. The  five-year deal underlines a new  dependence on foreign capital  and opens the way for Saudi to   launch its first international bond  issue and marks a significant  change in the kingdom s status  as it moves from being a creditor  nation to a debtor nation.  Global banks, particularly  Asian banks, have shown strong  interest in the deal, in spite of  rating agency downgrades of  Saudi Arabia s creditworthiness  since successive falls in oil prices.  Argentina sets record   on debt sale In a landmark moment,  Argentina has returned to global  bond markets with the largest  emerging-market debt sale on  record. The $16.5bn global debt  offering attracted high levels  of investor interest, enabling  Argentina to both increase   the initial size of the deal while  lowering yields. Underwriters  received more than four times  the value of the debt, according  to a report in The Wall Street  Journal. It also marks a change   in sentiment towards the  riskiness of emerging-market  bonds as they seek out yields.  MAKING  THE   NEWS  { CONTEXT OF TREASURY }  Central Bank of Argentina  headquarters, Buenos Aires    TECHNICAL BRIEFING  10  The Treasurer May 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Brexit continues to be debated and we have issued a Briefing Note  (www.treasurers.org/brexit-briefing). Commentators are divided   between warning about the uncertainty of an exit, and the risk that  apathy makes the outcome a random event. Otherwise, China holds   our interest, the US wobbles towards its election, while EU regulation  pauses with several of the old topics in limbo. If you have views you d   like us to take into account, email us at technical@treasurers.org  We have been receiving  requests from members   and the financial press to  opine changes afoot, but   the mix and scope of major  changes developing across  the world economies makes  it difficult to forecast  exchange rates and interest  rates. Treasurers need to  consider the potential for   less technical- and more  political-driven change   to impact on their businesses  as 2016 unfolds.  China Chinese growth, the slowing  or the calming down of  (remains officially forecast  at an enviable 6.5-7% for  2016), is still a hot topic.  Meanwhile, the Chinese  authorities manage concerns  over domestic bad debt,  develop their financial  markets and are using their  impressive accumulated FX  reserves to invest externally.  On the regulatory side,  Chinese money market funds  regulation has been brought  closer into line with that   of the West, although  Chinese funds are permitted  leverage. A 5% liquidity  buffer has been brought  into effect, funds are now  permitted to invest in  tradeable securities of  deposit, which could aid  liquidity, and the weighted   the Chinese can weather   a lot more change than the  UK before their problems  become international.  US The US election risk for  non-US businesses could  be increased protectionism  regardless as to which party  wins as the blue-collar  vote becomes the decider.  Treasurers may wish to  consider what strategic risks   of reduced access to US  markets may have in a world  where commodity and major  capital goods prices remain  dollar denominated.  UK The outcome of the UK  Brexit referendum remains  uncertain. Voter apathy could  be as much the decider,  with expert commentators  now stimulated to take  note of the UK s underlying  structural problems (see  Kristin Forbes  insightful  speech on managing  the UK external deficit  at www.bankofengland. co.uk/publications/Pages/ speeches/2016/890.aspx  made in March). Meantime,  the financial press has  started to look through an  exit vote to ponder on the  effect of the UK losing its  status as an access point to  EU markets.  Although stable at the   time of writing, sterling   has dropped 3.4% against   the US dollar and 6.5%  against the euro since   31 December 2015, which  recommends a cautious  approach to hedging.  So many variables, so  little time before they start  to crystalise. Perhaps time  to fix those rates where the  consequences of adverse  change is not affordable.  FORECASTING  AND REGULATION Steve Baseby is ACT associate policy and technical director @BasebyStephen  THIS MONTH  average maturity has been  shortened by 60 days to 120.  On the domestic economy,  the Chinese slowdown has  seen some commercial  businesses close, although  there is an element of  rebalancing as the domestic  demand develops.   We should not lose sight  of China s prodigious FX  reserves and low external  debt relative to major  Western economies, which  enables China to manage   its domestic economy, but   at risk to other economies   as reserves are converted   into cash. It is true that  China s FX reserves are  falling, dropping from  $3.4 trillion to $3.2 trillion  over January and February,  according to Bloomberg.  The causes extend beyond  supporting the domestic  economy and are made up   of infrastructure investment,  including overseas, and   the commencement   of loans through the   Asian Infrastructure  Investment Bank.  Now, consider that the  UK s FX reserves at the end  January were $159bn and,  while China s external debt  was $1.5 trillion at end of Q3,  the UK s external debt was  $8.4 trillion.

The  main impact for UK corporates   is affirmation of the intent to cap  interest deductions at 30% of  tax EBITDA with exceptions to  be discussed and agreed, which  are expected to be for private  finance initiative and public private  partnerships projects. This brings  the UK into line with Organisation  for Economic Co-operation and  Development (OECD) standards  intended to promote the base   erosion and profit shifting initiative,  and brings the UK into line with  other OECD members, including  Germany in the EU. Treasurers  will need to work with their tax  colleagues to understand the  impact on cash tax flows going  forward and consider if structural  changes to financing the balance  sheet are required.  A secondary impact will be  on labour costs. The already  announced National Living Wage  came into effect from 1 April   2016. Simply put, this could  increase annual costs by £900  per 25+-year-old employee  currently on the Basic Wage. Those  businesses that rely on private  contractors will need to watch  development on what appears   to be a review of IR35 practices   to take effect in the 2017/18   tax year, aimed primarily   at government   employers, but   worded as a   broader review.  { INTERNATIONAL }  EU regulation   some changes The European Banking  Authority progresses to issue   its guidelines, which will require  banks to impose the capital  valuation adjustment on  corporate derivatives. This   is where the margin is not  collateralised in contravention of  the EU Parliament s expectation  that it had removed this cost  from non-financial corporates  under European Market  Infrastructure Regulation. This  conflict will require resolution  within the Parliament.   MiFID II implementation has  been deferred until 3 January  2018, but we continue to work  with HM Treasury and through  the European Association of  Corporate Treasurers to try  and restore the Own Account  exemption, which enables  corporates to use trading   platforms such as 360T without  being deemed traders by the  Financial Conduct Authority  and its national equivalents  throughout the EU.   We have asked the Treasurers  Forum, but we would appreciate  any corporate letting us know   the impact of the loss of this  exemption.

Our financial controller  had me set up a comprehensive group cash-flow  forecast model. It went well and I was offered a  role in the newly set-up treasury function.  What do you like about treasury and your role?  Each day comes with new challenges and  experiences. My current role encompasses a wide  range of treasury responsibilities. The all-round  technical knowledge in various areas of treasury  helps me participate in the financial decision- making process with real confidence.  What s the best thing about being a member   of the ACT? I have access to a wide and diverse network  of treasury professionals. It is easy to receive  technical guidance through the query service  and various ACT publications; ACT events and  webinars are also an excellent source. What ACT qualifications do you hold? The AMCT qualification. How has your qualification benefited you in  your career so far? The AMCT qualification helped me climb the  treasury career ladder more rapidly. I qualified   as a management accountant and a chartered  certified accountant several years ago. I then  felt the need to equip myself with a treasury  qualification. The AMCT imparted an excellent  technical grounding and provided a toolkit that  helps me stay on top of my responsibilities.  What s the most important lesson that you ve  learned during your career? There is no substitute for hard work. What s your ultimate career goal? I m really looking for a role that maximises my   skill sets within both treasury and accounting. Who is your greatest inspiration and why?  Steve Jobs   his passion for creativity.

What  he meant was that funding   the UK s burgeoning current  account deficit relies crucially  on continued inflows of  foreign capital.  If there was a sudden loss  of foreign confidence in  the integrity of the British  economy, caused perhaps  by a vote to leave in the  coming referendum, then  these inflows might slow,  causing a fully blown balance  of payments crisis, a sharp  devaluation in the pound and  a destructive rise in interest  rates. As if to highlight his  concerns, Britain s current  account deficit swelled to  a jaw-dropping 7% of GDP  in the final quarter of last  year, by far the highest in the  developed world and a post- war record for Britain. If this  was just a one-off, it wouldn t  matter very much, but the UK  has been in deficit for much   of the past 30 years, and far  from improving, the position  now seems to be deteriorating  even further.   The current account is the  sum of the balance of trade  (goods and services exports  less imports), net income  from abroad and net current   transfers. When it is in deficit,  it is indicative of a country that  is essentially living beyond its  means, consuming more than  it earns. For a country in its  development phase, sucking in  imports to build infrastructure  and industrial capacity, it  would be a relatively benign  phenomenon. Eventually, the  growth thereby generated  would eradicate the deficit.  But for a mature, post- industrial economy such  as the UK, where business  and government investment  is subdued, it is indicative  of worrying structural  imbalances. A deficit as large  as the one run by the UK  would normally be a sign  of extreme overheating,  with domestic demand far  outstripping domestic output.   This is what we saw in some  of the peripheral economies   of the eurozone in the run-  up to the crisis. Yet with UK  inflation at virtually zero, there  is no sign of such a boom. That  hasn t stopped UK citizens  continuing to consume a lot  more than they produce. The  consequent shortfall is paid   for by sales of UK assets    government bonds, property  and corporations   to foreign  investors. This is only  sustainable as long as foreign  investors are happy to keep  sticking their money in the  UK. So far, they have been,  though recently there have   been signs of nervousness in  currency markets. Some recent  gilt auctions have also been  barely fully subscribed.   Some observers draw  comfort from the fact  that much of the recent  deterioration in the UK  current account is not really  about trade. Rather, it is to  do with falling income on  the country s huge stock of  overseas assets, particularly  multinational earnings, which  have suffered badly from the  commodities slump. At the  same time, foreign earnings  from the UK have increased.   Using market values, the  UK s overseas assets still far  outweigh its liabilities, in  marked contrast to some of the  eurozone countries hit by very  large current account deficits.  All the same, if overseas  income doesn t revive soon,  and with a struggling world  economy there is little reason   to believe it will, Britain could  be in some trouble. There  is no way of knowing what  the economic consequences  of Brexit might be; much  depends on the terms. But at  the very least, a vote to leave  will lead to a prolonged period  of uncertainty, and there is  nothing international capital  hates more than uncertainty.  Get ready for a roller-coaster  ride. Confidence is a delicate  commodity. There one  moment, gone the next,   it doesn t take much to  dislodge it.   The UK s current account deficit is the largest in the   developed world   and arguably at crisis levels  JEREMY WARNER { BRITISH ECONOMY }  A deficit as large as the one run  by the UK would normally be   a sign of extreme overheating  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer May 2016 The Treasurer  13  COMMENT    Learn more at dh.com  dh.com  Lending  Payments  Core  Channels     ©2016 D+H USA Corporation.

If individual European countries made  a policy shift towards isolationism and  protectionism, that would lead to slower  and lower quality growth for both them  and their trading partners.   The key risk from all of this is the threat  to European cohesion. If the UK votes out  in June, that could encourage copycats  to push for referendums in their own  countries. Since the UK has remained  outside the core club, an exit would be  problematic, but ultimately manageable.  There is another risk. Radical parties  that gain enough support to cause  disruption, but not to gain power, can  sap the capacity of mainstream parties  to make changes. They distract from the  core debate, sometimes require damage  control if they win a couple of regional  elections, as UKIP did in the UK, and they  raise the probability of hung governments  as Podemos did in Spain.   How should mainstream parties  respond? Better efforts to educate and  reduce the anxiety of voters about   Across Europe, support for populist  parties is increasing. Economic  difficulties in peripheral Europe    since 2008 have led to a rise in support   for left-wing radicals. Victory for Syriza   in the 2015 Greek elections is the obvious  example, but the far left has also gathered  momentum in Spain. Core Europe has   its populists, too. The migrant crisis and  terror attacks have boosted support for   the far right. Support for France s National  Front jumped following the November  attacks in Paris. In Germany, some recent  successes for the Eurosceptic AfD in state  elections reflect domestic resentment  towards Merkel s decision to allow so  many refugees into the country. And,   of course, voters in the UK go to the polls  on EU membership on 23 June.  It is not uncommon for populist parties  to gain support during times of economic  difficulty. The European recovery from  the great recession has not been smooth.  A policy failure by the European Central  Bank in 2011 that allowed contagion to  spread from Greece to the rest of the  eurozone set the recovery back several  years. Some of the steps taken to prevent  a repeat of the financial crisis have also  taken some of the fizz out of the recovery.  Increased financial regulation and public  spending cuts have led to more sluggish  growth than might normally be expected.  Several significant geopolitical crises east  of the continent have added to that.   Challenging economic and political  conditions are fertile ground for populist  parties to gather steam. Tapping into the  frustrations and fears of common voters  and placing the blame on the mainstream  parties and multinational institutions  like the EU can be an effective tactic to  build support. The problem is that, at  first sight, populists may appear more in  tune to the needs of the common voter.  But, ultimately, arguments that foreign   the beneficial societal, economic and  cultural impacts of integration and  immigration might work. But populists  would treat such efforts with suspicion,  as propaganda, while the political elites  continue to progress their own political  vision for Europe. This could backfire.   Another option would be to further  integrate populist parties into the  mainstream. Removing them from the  edge of the debate could encourage them  to shift towards the centre in order to gain  supporters. But it risks crystallising their  positions. The most effective solution  would be for incumbent mainstream  parties to go to greater effort with pro- growth reform. Populists rely on frustrated  voters. Realistically, only changes that  improve the status quo will treat the root  cause of the problem.

It s also a chance for the  committee to see some   of the next generation of   finance leaders.  Fortunately, the non- executives were sanguine   about the position and saw  hedging and treasury policies  as a long-term arrangement,  whereby you are not looking  to be a profit centre. Being  able to fix some parts of   your cost structure and risks  for certainty in uncertain  times is something not all  parts of companies are in    It s that most wonderful  time of the year   finals  and full-year reporting!  As well as year-end work,  we have also had to face the  annual trial by committee    well, risk committee   and  have our policies, controls   and positions reviewed by   this board subgroup.  I should not complain too  much. The risk committee  has most of the non-executive  directors who have generally  been supportive over the years.  And, as many are former FDs,  they know their stuff   or at  least think they do! They were  mainly executives around 10  years ago, but have remained  in touch and bring experience.  This will be helpful this   year, as markets have been  volatile and some of our  hedges are not looking so  clever at current mark-to- market valuations.  We prepared fully (with  appendices, summaries and a  concise paper on the positions  and proposals) and got ready  to demonstrate that, despite  having had a number of  our team moved to a shared  service centre previously, we  have maintained controls and  not had any adverse internal  audit reports.   We did agree with the  CFO how best to present the  hedging position. We had  met the policy of achieving  sufficient hedges or positions,  but the mark-to-market issue  in isolation was distinctly less  positive. Maybe the banks   will not be so unhappy   about the level of ancillary   business   unless they ve  closed their positions already?  We decided that we must,  at all times, be transparent.  Hedges are for the medium  term, not just for one season,  and there have been years  when it has been the other  way around and in the money.  We were not seen as heroes  then, so why should we be  villains now? The business  is not so happy at present    feeling that costs were higher  than if we had done nothing.  We gently reminded them   of the protection they  received the year before last  when hedges reduced the   all-in cost as compared with  spot pricing.

It felt good    to have supportive, or at   least understanding,    friends in high places    in these circumstances.  At present, the overriding  need is to be transparent and  able to clearly communicate  your position and strategy  both inside and outside an  organisation   particularly  given the variety of  stakeholders the treasury  teams need to manage.  Internally, especially, it  is vital to demonstrate that  you have operated a clear  and rational plan, and that it  offers the benefit of certainty.  Of course, in an ideal world  you would play things very  differently in some individual  trades or actions, but having  a balanced and sensible  approach clearly validates   a rounded risk management  framework, and that we are  the rightful guardians of  much of it.

I would be delighted to  discuss these views with as  many of you as I can, so I  look forward to meeting you  at one of the ACT events we  have in our spring calendar,  particularly the Middle East  Annual Dinner and Treasury  Awards in Dubai on 11 May  (see www.treasurers.org/ middleeastannualdinner) or  the ACT Annual Conference  in Liverpool, 18-20 May  (see www.treasurers.org/ annualconference).    www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer May 2016 The Treasurer  19  Treasurers in Asia are just as  concerned with regulation   as their global counterparts  I have recently come   back from a trip to  Singapore and Hong   Kong to talk to potential  sponsors, supporters and  institutions about our   events in Asia during   2016, specifically the Asia  Treasury Leaders  Forum on   21 September in Hong Kong.   A number of different issues  crossed my path, which   I think will resonate.  Firstly, it s worth pointing  out that treasurers in Asia  are just as concerned with  regulation as their global  counterparts. Bearing in  mind that Asia encompasses  economies in varying states   of economic development,   a wide variety of FX and  capital regimes, a huge   mix of legacy and modern  technology banking systems  (especially in consumer  and retail sectors) and an  800-pound gorilla economy  in China, one can easily  understand their concerns.  More specifically, compared  with treasurers in the EU (yes,  still including the UK at time  of writing) and the US, Asian  financial regulators haven t  yet set about derivatives  markets in ways that directly  affect their local treasurers.  Of course, Basel III, the G20  initiatives and IASB rules are  dragging on the real economy,  but in many respects, Asian  economies and financial  markets have yet to feel the   full impact of the regulatory  wave. There is some sense   that there s a little time  left, but, fortunately, there  doesn t seem to be a corporate  derivatives party, which   will leave a bad hangover!  Secondly, Asian treasurers  have a much wider banking  community to draw on  domestically, but also cross- regionally. Does that make  life easier? In these days of  KYC/KYB and Basel III, it  would seem not. Treasurers  are challenged to understand  which banks are well  structured and capitalised,  which have the right product  ranges, which have the right  international networks and  who they can deal with safely  and securely.   My third issue is that capital  markets in Asia for corporates  are not (yet) developed, liquid  or even functioning in many  regional economies. This is  clearly a worry when bank  capital will certainly dry up in  the next few years and access  to international markets will  require regional corporates  to become more transparent,  as well as ratings agency- and  investor-friendly. There are  some suggestions of positive  developments (see www. treasurers.org/node/318485),  and many regional corporates  have been to the US private  markets successfully in recent  years, but there is much work  to be done.  All in all, these are exciting  times to be a corporate  treasurer in Asia and the ACT  is stepping up its efforts to  assist in the development  of the profession. To mix  metaphors,  from tiny acorns  grow huge bamboo !   { ENGAGEMENT }  COMMENT  PETER MATZA Banks, regulation, access   the concerns of treasurers   in Asia look very much like those in other markets  IM A  G ES  O U  R C  E  Don t hesitate to drop me a   line at pmatza@treasurers.org  Hong Kong s Soho  district in Central          When Andrew Koss arrived at Drax in 2005, the coal-fired  power station close to the town of Selby in North Yorkshire  had already been a landmark for motorists on the M62    for 30 years. What passing traffic did not realise is that however  solid and immovable this facility appeared   with 12 giant  cooling towers spewing water vapour onto the skyline   it   faced an uncertain future.  Koss had been appointed company treasurer to lead a  refinancing as part of plans for Drax s initial public offering  in December that year. Despite its strategic importance in  producing 8% of the UK s electricity, the asset had fallen into  the hands of its lenders when its largest customer, TXU Europe,  went under following the collapse of Enron.  For Koss, the attraction was working on a bumper balance  sheet restructuring, but also setting up, a treasury department  from scratch. He ignored warnings from former colleagues at  doorstep lender Provident Financial that Drax would be sold,  not floated   and his new job would not exist anymore. It was   a baptism of fire every bit as hot as one of Drax s six furnaces.  Says Koss:  As soon as I arrived, my new boss said:  You re on  your own, I m going on an investor roadshow. We haven t got a  CEO so I m off to the States. Give me a call if there are any issues,  but over to you.  In one respect it was quite scary, in another, it  was a huge amount of responsibility and a real opportunity to  take it on   but I was completely new to the sector.”  The doubters were nearly right: Drax might not have made   it onto the stock exchange. Between announcing its intention   to float in the summer and selling shares in the December,   it received three separate takeover offers that threatened to  derail the management s plan. The company did get away     a remarkable reversal of fortune after losses that hit £700m in  2002   only two weeks before Koss  wife was due to give birth   to their first child.   I can still picture it: we were in the final throes of the  negotiation and I was painting our kitchen at 1am. On the   other end of the phone were the banks all round a table. It   was quite a surreal time.” Koss has since moved up through the  ranks, becoming chief executive of Drax Power, the company s  generating arm, one of its three divisions, in a reorganisation   a year ago.  Koss retrained in treasury after moving to Yorkshire from  London 16 years ago and passed his AMCT in 2002.  I did find  the AMCT very helpful to me when I was getting to know the  ropes in treasury,” he says. His last job in the City had been   20  The Treasurer May 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  BAPTISM OF FIRE A refinancing, a change of ownership  and a radical move away from coal  towards renewables   Andrew Koss s  time at Drax Power has been marked  by evolution  Words: James Ashton / Photography: Rob Whitrow    www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer May 2016 The Treasurer  21  working on Eastern European derivatives for an investment  bank. It just happened that Provident Financial, based in  Bradford, was looking for someone in that area as it expanded  in the region. Koss found himself learning on the job, but also  committed to doing the exams.   On the banking side, you are dealing with customers; here  was an opportunity to work on the corporate side and see how  they approach things with the banks. I was gobsmacked at how  different it was working in a corporate environment to working  in a banking environment. The discipline and the rigour of  working in a corporate was much stronger, I found.”  A question of understanding Drax has a long history. It was built by the Central Electricity  Generating Board and transferred to National Power at  privatisation in 1990. Then, it was sold on to American energy  provider AES for £1.9bn in 1998. When AES quit the UK in 2003,  the facility was passed into the hands of its lending banks.  Koss joined at the same time as the financial controller and  had to put in place a treasury team which hadn t existed before  because Drax had never been a freestanding company.   It really was a question of understanding what was going  on and putting the basic controls in place around cash  management and payments,” he says.  All of our coal had been  bought in the UK and we were only just starting to buying  internationally. Realising that we had currency exposures  because the coal was denominated in dollars took a little while.”  Because it was a small team, Koss found himself writing  policy and procedures one minute and, the next down with  the banks, putting in place a £800m bank facility with trading  lines. Negotiating that relationship with the banks was made  more difficult because some of the lenders bidding to handle its  refinancing were also among the exiting shareholders in Drax.  One bank, which was managing the group of lenders in the  workout, failed to get the underwriting mandate because  they  came in with very high pricing and a very conservative set of  terms. They were miles away from where others were. But we  had to keep them sweet because they were key to unlocking the  deal when we moved from the old structure to the new. It was   a very delicate balance.”  By 2008, Drax was long past the survival stage and Koss  role  expanded. An opportunity to take on the recently vacated role  of head of investor relations came up, and Koss put himself  forward when he bumped into the chief executive, Dorothy  Thompson, on the stairs.   I think there was a lot of commonality. In treasury, you are  that external face for debt relations with your banks   making  the complex things simple, which I think is a real skill. I felt,  well how different could equity investors be to debt investors?”  Coincidentally, Thompson, who arrived just after Koss, came  from the same treasury background. She worked as assistant  group treasurer for Powergen and then ran the European  business of InterGen, which was a subsidiary of Shell and  Bechtel that also generated power.  PROFILE   In treasury, you are that  external face for debt relations  with your banks   making the  complex things simple”    22  The Treasurer May 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  It was her vision that took the company  heavily into sustainable biomass. The attraction  of biomass, or more specifically compressed  wood pellets, made from low-grade material that  solid-wood industries, such as construction and  furniture making can t use, is that it has a carbon  footprint 80% of that of coal and 60% of natural  gas. Crucially, unlike any other renewable, it can  generate energy exactly when it is needed.  Drax had been experimenting with the  technology behind this greener model by burning compressed  wood pellets instead of coal since 2003. The company originally  planned to move into biomass via a £2bn partnership with  German engineer Siemens to produce 900MW of power from  three new biomass-fired plants. But, the business realised  that an upgrade of the existing power station would be faster  and more affordable than building something new. The UK  government said it would offer Drax support if it converted  three of its six generating units away from coal to biomass  technology at its existing site.   More than just a cash cow The changes would require an entirely new supply chain and an  investment of approximately £700m, which would necessitate  the support of both investors and lenders as it means a change  to Drax s capital structure.   Up to 2008, we were a cash cow. The launch of the  partnership with Siemens was the first time we were saying,    no, we want the cash to invest .    We developed some cutting-edge technology, which we   were then able to apply to the plant at Drax, which we realised  could make a huge contribution to the UK s carbon reduction  targets and means there is a life beyond Drax as just a coal  plant,” says Koss.  So far, two of its six generation units have been converted  and a third awaits a decision by the European Commission on  whether it will allow state aid support. Koss envisages all six    We developed cutting- edge technology, which  we realised could make   a huge contribution to the  UK s carbon reduction”  VITAL  STATISTICS  12  Drax has 12    cooling towers, each  114m high and large  enough to house a  building the size of   St Paul s Cathedral  80,000  Around 80,000 tonnes  of biomass are stored   in each of its four large  domes   each 30%   bigger than the Royal  Albert Hall  259  At 259m, the   main chimney is  approximately double   the height of the  London Eye  660  Each of Drax s six  generation units is   capable of producing  660MW of electricity,   enough to power  everything with a city  the size of Manchester    www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer May 2016 The Treasurer  23  being upgraded in time, especially as the government plans to  shut all coal-fired stations by 2025 to lower carbon emissions.  Some facilities are mothballing sooner. Engie, the French  utility that owns the Rugeley coal plant in Staffordshire, said   in February it would close this summer because of power prices  being close to 15-year lows and high carbon costs. Koss admits:   The economics of coal are very tough at the moment. I would  say, without the moves we have made to convert half the plant,  we would be in a very difficult situation.”  He adds:  We have a historic hedge in place. Where we had  sold forward we are protected, certainly last year and this year,  because of the fact we hedged at higher prices than are available  today. And today we are not necessarily selling forward very  much at these levels. What we are doing, certainly on coal units,  is all about flexibility: being there when the market needs us,  when the wind is not blowing, providing back up, which tends  to be when prices are a little higher.”  But the UK chancellor also made electricity sales from  biomass tougher last summer when he removed the climate  change levy from renewable electricity schemes, a move that  Drax forecast would cost it £90m between this year and last.  It was ever thus. Koss characterises the power industry as  placing long-term bets   on strategy, financing and investment    and hoping that short-term shocks from the commodity  markets or regulators do not derail the company. It explains why  the business is run on conservative lines. In 2009, for example,  when commodity markets turned, the company raised £100m of  equity in an emergency fund raising to pay off all of the group s  debt so it could keep its investment grade rating. Koss believes  his early skills learned in treasury have stood him in good stead.   We are not spread over 50 countries, we don t need to do big,  consolidated sets of accounts. We are driven by understanding  commodities risk, treasury risk and capital structure, so I think  the treasury qualification has really helped me there.”   James Ashton is a freelance business journalist  ANDREW S CV 2015-present   Chief executive, Drax Power Ltd 2013-2015   Director of strategy, Drax 2010-2013   Head of corporate finance and risk, Drax 2008-2010   Head of corporate finance and investor relations, Drax 2005-2008   Treasurer, Drax 2001-2005   Deputy group treasurer, Provident Financial 2000-2001   Financial services manager, KPMG 2000   Business analyst, Dresdner Kleinwort Benson 1996-1998   Head of global bond options and exotic derivatives   middle office, UBS  1995-1996  Equity trade analyst, Lehman Brothers  1992-1995  Corporate tax accountant, Coopers & Lybrand  QUALIFICATIONS: Mathematics, operational research, statistics    and economics (MORSE) BSc (Hons) first class,   Warwick University (1992), AMCT 2002, MCT (2003)  ANDREW S TOP TIPS   FOR SUCCESS  1  Communication is absolutely the key.

PROFILE    INSIGHT  24  The Treasurer May 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  If you build it…  Boosted by transport and renewable energy investment,  institutional investors continue to increase their  commitment to project finance. Paul Golden reports  Banks (commercial, multilateral and  export finance) account for 80% of  total project finance, he adds.  Banks  like transportation projects backed by  large multinational developers acting  as sponsors.”  Competition and diversity Doug Segars, associate MD of Moody s  EMEA project and infrastructure  finance team, suggests that funding  sources are becoming more diverse.   Bank lending is highly competitive  and public bond issues are making   a comeback,” he says,  particularly  where large amounts of long-dated  finance is needed, but the real story   is private debt, both for new projects  and as a source of refinancing for  existing bank loans.”   According to Segars, demand-risk  projects are once again financeable,  as long as sponsors are realistic about  leverage and demand forecasts.  We   see evidence of this in the number   of European toll roads that have been  financed or refinanced over the past  several months.”  Investors will need to be very  comfortable about the sponsor s  revenue projections, observes TC  Treasury Services consultant Tony  Chitty, director of international   trade finance at engineering firm  Mabey Bridge.   Sponsors would be well advised  to have a plan B in the event that the  projected revenue was not forthcoming  for whatever reason,” he explains.  In  most cases, lenders would be looking   Good news for investors who favour  infrastructure projects: data from  online intelligence service IJGlobal   indicates that the global project finance  sector closed significantly more  transactions last year than during the  previous 12 months. The number of deals  rose by more than 10% to 859, although  total transaction volume was up only  marginally ($309.1bn compared with  $308.4bn in 2014).  Data provider Dealogic recorded a  similar increase in the number of projects  closed, but recorded higher figures for  global project finance volumes in 2015  ($422bn). Europe, the Middle East and  Africa (EMEA) accounted for 37% of the  total market, up from 33% in 2014, with  299 deals completed.  Energy received the largest amount  of investment worldwide, although in  Europe transport was the largest sector   by volume.  These figures underline the view of  Michael Wilkins, MD, infrastructure  finance ratings at Standard & Poor s,  that there is very strong appetite in the  capital markets for infrastructure project  exposure, both equity and debt.   Commercial banks have been  interested in debt exposure since the  early days of project finance in the 1990s,  and this level of interest has risen in  recent years, particularly among northern  European and Japanese institutions,”  he says.  The other source of finance is  institutional, including pension funds,  insurers, sovereign wealth funds and asset  managers, who are looking for long-dated  exposure with stable cash flows.”    www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer May 2016 The Treasurer  25    26  The Treasurer May 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  for some measure of government support  for public infrastructure projects, and  if the project was of clear public benefit  (for example, a bridge that significantly  reduced journey times on a busy route,  or a river crossing that negated a 20-mile  diversion), the state may agree to provide  such support, albeit only as a backstop.”  Nedim Music, assistant director  of corporate finance debt advisory  at Deloitte UK, agrees that there is  greater interest in infrastructure assets    Bank lending is highly competitive and public bond  issues are making a comeback, particularly where  large amounts of long-dated finance is needed”  where there is an annual government  contribution.  For example, investing in  a toll road where future income depends  on the number of vehicles that use the  road is clearly less predictable.”  Yield pick-up relative to comparable  asset classes is one of the factors  investors will take into account when  considering whether to back a project,  explains Wilkins. The average yield on  a sovereign bond is around 1%, whereas  infrastructure projects generate between  2.5% and 4%.  International Project Finance  Association council member Darryl  Murphy says a number of banks   remain uncertain about their long-  term financing appetite.  While there   is interest in short-term acquisitions   of infrastructure assets, many banks   are trying to figure out what they can    do in terms of long-term lending.   In the meantime, private-placement  investors, such as insurers and debt  funds, are putting more capital into  project finance.”  Investment climate Deal flow in Europe has been adversely  affected by the economic climate,  which has limited investment in new  infrastructure projects. As a result, the  ability of project sponsors to dictate  terms has been strengthened.   In terms of sectors, we have seen   a move towards renewables as   public-private partnerships have  declined,” explains Murphy.  However,  there is still a strong focus on risk  management and stability of revenue.  Regulatory risk is also a concern for  investors in light of retrospective   PROJECT FINANCE   A DEFINITION The International Project Finance  Association defines project finance as  the financing of long-term infrastructure,  industrial projects and public services  based on a non-recourse or limited  recourse financial structure where  project debt and equity used to finance  the project are paid back from the cash  flow generated by the project.  BIG IN INFRASTRUCTURE    MAIN PLAYERS  The European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development is owned by 65 stakeholder  governments, as well as the EU and the  European Investment Bank (EIB). Uniquely   for a development bank, it has a political  mandate   it will only assist projects in  democratic countries. Projects of note include  the construction of an arch to enclose reactor  4 at Chernobyl and seal its radioactive  content from the surroundings.  The EIB is owned by EU member states  and was formed to represent EU policy  interests. It finances environmental and  climate change initiatives, as well as providing  infrastructure finance and funds projects  mainly through loans. Its lending reached  €77.5bn last year. In March this year, the EIB  signed its biggest loan to date for India. This  will go towards the construction of a new  metro in Lucknow, and comprises financing   of €450m. In 2014, the EIB extended a  €900m loan to help finance expansion at the  port of Rotterdam that will increase the port s  capacity by 20%.  The Organisation for Economic Co-operation  and Development export credit agencies,  including UK Export Finance, ekn in Sweden  and Exim in the US, also play a role in project  finance, providing guarantees to banks. They  have had significant involvement in power- generation projects, for instance.

Insurance companies and pension  funds are hungry for yields and looking  to deploy capital, so there is a lot of  appetite for infrastructure assets.”  Most of the assets in the infrastructure  space have behaved in a very predictable  way, generating steady returns over a  long-time horizon, says Giles Frost, chief  executive of international infrastructure  sponsor and manager Amber  Infrastructure. One of the benefits of  project finance is that the returns are  largely (or in some cases completely)  uncorrelated to wider economic factors.  Playing the long game? Manish Gupta, head of infrastructure  corporate finance at EY, also suggests  that anyone looking to invest for a period  shorter than seven to eight years should  be looking for alternatives.   There are many infrastructure  debt instruments that are liquid, such  as government-guaranteed bonds  previously issued by Network Rail  or high-credit-quality bonds issued  by infrastructure companies, such  as Heathrow Airport and regulated  utilities,” he says.  I am aware of many  institutional investors who have invested  in high-credit-rated bonds, in some  cases as a replacement for gilts.”  Matthew Cutts, financial institutions  global sector head at built assets design  and consultancy firm Arcadis, describes  the availability of finance for private- sector projects in the UK as positive.   The UK is becoming a mature  market for insurers and pension funds  to provide long-term debt and, despite  the EU referendum, it is viewed as a  long-term stable income market,” he  explains.  Transportation projects are  probably still most favoured, although  they are few and far between. Energy is  probably more of a risk due to political  uncertainty regarding tariffs and end- customer pressures.”  A spokesperson for construction  services company Carillion says project  finance is generally available from  financial institutions, such as Aviva   and Legal & General.  When considering whether to back  a project, investors take into account  political certainty, availability of local  partners (particularly operators) and  certainty of long-term yield/revenues,  adds Cutts.  Companies need to be able   to deliver cost, operational and asset life  cycle certainty.”  Another important caveat, adds  Segars, is that not all lenders have the  same investment objectives. Sponsors  may need to structure their projects  to meet the needs of the particular  investors from which they are seeking  to raise debt. A recent example of this  phenomenon is the financing of German  wind-farm developer WindMW, which  closed in December 2015 with eight  tranches of debt offering different  maturities and currencies.  It should also be noted that project  finance remains subject to market   cycles. In a report on project finance  investment published last year by Clear  Path Analysis, Viktor Kats, co-head of  International Finance Corporation s  global infrastructure fund, observed  that, over time, the perceived risk  profile of infrastructure projects will  be adjusted, brownfield assets will  no longer be viewed as risk-free and  managed greenfield risk will be viewed  as something that can be handled.   Paul Golden is a freelance business and  finance journalist  INFRASTRUCTURE DEALS In December 2014, life insurance company MetLife  announced that a consortium of its affiliates and third- party investor clients had provided $200m in financing to  railway leasing firm Angel Trains Group, bringing its total  investment in UK rail infrastructure to more than $1bn.  Most of the lending MetLife does is on existing  operating assets   the majority of its infrastructure  portfolio comprises of first lien debt, explains John  Tanyeri, MD and head of infrastructure investments   in Europe.   As with most insurance companies, we are an asset- liability management firm, and when we look at the  assets that match up with those liabilities, infrastructure  generally has stable cash flows over long periods and  some form of direct or indirect government support,”   he says.  The challenge for major institutional investors  is maintaining deal flow as competition for large  infrastructure projects intensifies, adds Tanyeri.  We   have seen a number of new debt funds emerge and  insurance companies and pension funds becoming more  interested in the debt aspect of the capital structure for  a number of infrastructure companies. This had led to  increased liquidity, which results in tighter spreads and  looser covenants.”  Valuations for existing infrastructure assets are high,  which has led to concerns that the market might be  overheating. Companies such as MetLife are hoping that  economic growth in Europe will create new investment  opportunities in this asset class.  Another factor influencing deal flow is pension funds  with very long liabilities buying infrastructure assets  and holding them for much longer than conventional  investors, who might recirculate the asset after seven   to 10 years.   We are always looking at how the asset performs  over multiple economic cycles,” concludes Tanyeri.   When you look across our $10.5bn portfolio, it is pretty  much comprised of airports, rail, transmission and  telecommunications   essential assets.”    Since 1979 moneycorp have  been open for your business Call one of our dedicated industry experts today for your business   foreign exchange requirements on +44 (0)207 823 7800   Moneycorp Financial Risk Management Ltd is authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority for the conduct of designated investment  business.

The survey  represents a random sample of 191 treasurers, which  is the largest group we (or any professional treasury  body) have worked with to date on a global basis.  These individuals are mainly, but not exclusively,  ACT members and students working in non-financial  organisations across the world, from west to east and  north to south. This is the real voice of treasurers from  the only Chartered body for the profession.  Corporate treasury is a profession built on the  foundation of a number of financial, business and  personal disciplines. The ACT defines these in its  Competency Framework and considers them to be the  skills and capabilities needed by treasury professionals  to operate successfully in today s challenging business   Introduction As a professional body, the ACT has two primary concerns: to advance the  interests of its members and students, and to enhance the understanding  and appreciation of corporate treasury as a discipline in financial and  business management  environment. From tactical to strategic issues,   treasury is about advising on appropriate choices,   the trade-offs and compromises involved, and  executing corporate business policy.  The analysis and results of this continuing project  helps the ACT and, by extension, other treasury  associations we work with globally, to provide  evidence-based support for our interactions with  policymakers, legislators and regulators.   Additionally, this report helps inform our own work  when providing professional training and delivering  professional qualifications to individuals in both non- financial and financial organisations. And equally as  important, it allows the treasury profession to speak  with authority and integrity on the role that treasurers  play in making their organisations successful.   The ACT s Competency Framework can be found at  www.treasurers.org/competencyframework    TRENDS IN TREASURY 31  What are treasurers   really telling us? Strategic focus: the amount of time treasury is spending   on strategic issues is rising and this is the area most  expected to see increased activity over the coming   12 months.  Pessimism wins: the cost of credit has started to increase  over the past 12 months and further rises are expected.  Trusted adviser: more boards are asking for further advice  from their treasuries   and then acting upon what they hear.  Regulatory drag: there is a continuing negative, albeit  resigned, response from treasurers to the increase in  financial regulation.  Technology drivers: while it is probable that treasury  technology investment will remain stable or perhaps  increase, treasurers are unlikely to be early adopters   of wider fintech innovations.    TRENDS IN TREASURY32  Who is the   contemporary  treasurer?  E ach to their own, but the question highlights where individuals  think their activity is most focused.  The growth and development of the treasury profession has  generally been concentrated in larger corporates, and just over   70% of our respondents work in companies with sales in excess of  £1bn. The bigger the business, the weightier the issues; which is why  we see a greater emphasis on strategy in businesses with more than  £10bn of sales. Within these larger businesses, treasurers report that  they spend 32% of their time on strategic issues.  But we are also seeing the rise of professional treasury roles in  companies with sales as low as £200m, which suggests that treasury  is being recognised as a strategic partner for business across all sizes  of companies.  In general, our treasurers expect to spend more time on business  strategy, risk and corporate funding, with operations and controls  declining in focus. Clearly, this will vary by business, geography and  need, but it says to us that the role of treasury is widening, with  treasurers becoming involved in these issues to a greater extent, even if  not at the leading edge within their organisations. (See figures 1 and 21)  Experience matters, of course   not to mention being professionally  qualified, but our age and gender profiles are moving down the curve,  which reflects the growth of the profession and the numbers of newer  entrants. More than 85% of those surveyed had more than five years   treasury experience, which is why their opinions count. (See figure 3)  For the first time in our series, we have asked respondents  themselves to distinguish whether activities they carry  out as part of their role are strategic or operational  WHAT RESPONDENTS MEAN BY STRATEGIC VERSUS FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITIES  Strategic  Medium- to long-term issues  Risk management  Capital structure  Direction of travel  Exploring opportunities  High level  Financial basis for growth  Response to environment  Adding realism  Functional  Short- to medium-term   cash management  Risk assessment  Information  reporting and advice  Daily cash positions  Day-to-day support  Operations  Improving margins  Funding  Liquidity  management  FX  FIGURE 3.

W e have seen increases once again this year for most  groups, but it is noticeable that EU treasurers and those  in government organisations in particular are reporting  higher levels of exposure than their counterparts   elsewhere. (See figure 4) The subjects that respondents report on to their boards tend to   reflect the main areas of treasury activity, so capital and liquidity  management and risk management remain the topics most  commonly reported on to boards. Corporate finance is the third   most reported topic, although it is more commonly addressed   by continental Europe-based treasurers than by those in the UK.   That s the case for business strategy reports and pensions  management, too.   We also looked this year at reporting by business type and found  that different industries place different emphasis on particular  aspects of their reporting. So, for instance, wholesale and retail  companies place a greater premium on risk management and  treasury operations and controls. Treasurers working in utilities  are more likely to report on pensions management (45% of them)  than overall (26%). Both manufacturing and wholesale and retail  companies show higher than average levels of reporting on improving  working capital (77% against an average of 61%) and supply chain  finance (50% compared with an average of 31%).   So, if treasurers are talking to boards about funding options, what  does that say about the funding they have? Unsurprisingly, debt  capital markets are represented slightly higher up the chain for UK  companies than for treasurers based in continental Europe or the  Middle East. For smaller and non-public companies, bank finance still  rules the roost, although asset-based finance appears important for  smaller companies (below £250m sales). (See figure 5)  One area where treasurers are clearly living up to their cautious  reputation has been their inability to predict the relative cost of  credit. For three years, respondents have predicted that credit would  become more expensive over the ensuing 12 months   and for three  years, they have been wrong. Well, in the past year that caution has  proved well founded   the cost of credit has moved upwards in the  past 12 months. There is also broad agreement that the increased cost  anticipated for next 12 months will be bad for business. Perhaps some  treasurers haven t heard the ACT s message in the past few years to   fund early, fund often and fund long!” (See figure 6)  The visibility of treasurers to their boards seems to be  improving over time, judging by answers from the four  years we have conducted this survey   FIGURE 4.

For example, 19% of  treasurers in businesses with more than   £10bn of sales say they are not consulted at    all, whereas, in companies with sales below £250m,   more than half of treasurers say they are closely  involved. A case of larger businesses having too   many riches, or smaller ones recognising their talented  staff, perhaps?   Treasury technology is playing a stable role. Almost  all respondents plan to increase treasury technology  investment or keep it at current levels. In fintech we  have an almost perfect statistical model between  innovators and laggards. In fact, treasury is slightly  behind standard societal expectations when it   comes to adopting new technology   a reflection   of treasurers  famed sense of caution. (See figure 7)  In last year s report, we commented on the involvement   of treasurers in new business and market development  FIGURE 8.

This suggests not only that we re getting used to  pointless bureaucracy, but that younger treasury staff see regulation  as part of the job.  The good news is that treasurers remain positive and generally  satisfied about their role and the level of stimulation it brings to  working life. With limited outliers, there is higher indication of  increased interest over the previous five years now than was reported  in 2014 s survey. Additionally, treasurers in strategic roles on balance  find higher levels of satisfaction and lower levels of frustration than  those in more functional roles. That s the nature of career progression.  (See figure 9)  Last year s survey also talked about the skills young treasurers lack  and the message is repeated, if nuanced, this year. (See figure 10)  We asked additionally this year: who is responsible for addressing  skills gaps in younger treasurers? And the results show no great  confidence in corporate remedies. (See figure 11)  Although the ACT has revamped its qualifications over the past  couple of years and online learning is now increasingly preferred,  the survey suggests that, in some parts of the world (the US in  particular), ACT qualifications lack presence in the local market.   We are working very hard to change that perception.

These  organisations import   and export goods and  services, and are staffed   by UK, other EU and   non-EU employees.  Next month, the UK  voting population will decide  whether the UK is to leave or  remain in the EU; debate and  public opinion are deeply split  as to the implications.  A key point to bear in   mind is that if the UK   votes in favour of leaving   the EU, the UK will need   to maintain equivalence   if the financial services   sector is to continue to   be able to operate within   the remaining EU. The  financial services regulatory  structure is most likely to  remain in place, and this  is reinforced by the UK s  membership of G20, the  source of most of the   post-2008 regulation.  SH U  TT ER  ST O  C KStaying in does not    mean  no change  The UK prime minister s  decision to call the  referendum was made after  agreeing with the other  EU heads of state certain  changes governing the UK s  relationship with the EU.   In the UK, the press has  tended to concentrate on  changes to social welfare  rights obtained by David  Cameron, but the changes  that affect financial markets  are critical for treasurers and,  in essence, recognise the ring- fencing of non-EU states from  EU states going forward and  the creation of a two-tier EU.  For example, banking union  and resolution of banking  issues only applies to eurozone  states, thereby recognising that  the European Central Bank s  remit is limited to eurozone  members. Similarly, further  economic and monetary  union can progress within the  eurozone, but must respect  the rights of non-eurozone  member states to opt out.  Essentially, irrespective  of the outcome of the  UK referendum, the EU  will become fragmented,  comprising a eurozone  bloc and some other non- eurozone countries.  But leaving does not  mean regulatory freedom  Leave  campaigners  frequently make reference  to the wish to be free  from Brussels-originated  regulation. However, it  should be noted that with  regard to financial regulation: •  The basic terms of the   Capital Requirements  Directive, Bank Recovery  and Resolution Directive,  European Market  Infrastructure Regulation,  and MiFID arise from the  Pittsburgh commitments by  the G20, which, as a matter  of legal process, have been  implemented through the  EU. As the UK is a member  of G20 and is not voting  on 23 June on whether to  remain in the G20, these   regulations will still apply   in the UK.  •  Equivalence is a crucial  word. The UK financial  community is able to operate  across the world s financial  centres, including those of  the rest of the EU, because  the UK s financial regulation  is similar in substance and  enforcement to that of other  global financial centres.  Changing substantially from  the current form would lose  the UK s equivalence status  and those markets would  be closed to the UK. Losing  equivalence would lose a  substantial export market  (and potentially the very  people who populate much  of the City of London as they  decamp to other financial  centres, with a knock-on  effect on back-office jobs,  the service sector in London  and housing prices).  The vote itself   creates volatility The immediate concern   for corporate treasurers    AS THE UK S VOTE ON EU MEMBERSHIP  DRAWS CLOSER, SO THE NEED TO LOOK  AT IMPLICATIONS GROWS MORE PRESSING.  STEVE BASEBY LOOKS AT FUTURE TRADING  MODELS FOR THE UK  In search  of a new  accord     www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer May 2016 The Treasurer  39  were made following an   EU exit.  •  It would mean that the UK  would not have to accept  free movement or contribute  to the EU budget, but   goods exported to EU  countries would have to  meet EU standards.  •  WTO trade agreements  mean that the UK would  have to apply to have a single  universal set of tariff rates,  covering imports from the  EU and the rest of the world  alike. Under WTO rules, the  UK would not be allowed to  treat any of the WTO s 161  other members differently,  unless there was a trade  agreement in place.  An exit will lead to   a debate about trade The UK business world  has long been the home of  multinational organisations.  The London Stock Exchange s  liquidity, and the UK s open  and stable regulation, have  made the UK a natural home  for big business. Ease of  access to the broader EU  real economy and financial  markets has made the UK   a point of entry to the EU.  The longer-term  uncertainty of leaving is  that the continuing trade  relationships with the  remainder of the EU would  have to be renegotiated. The  freedom with which UK- based businesses import  from, and sell to, other EU  member states and that their  staff have to move across EU  borders, cannot be assumed  to continue. For example,  businesses based in the UK  need to begin to consider how  to operate in a world where  similar customs duties and  business visas are required  to trade with and work in  Germany as are required in  the US.  In the event of a UK   vote to leave the EU, each  member state would wish   to maximise its position. For  example, Emmanuel Macron,   single market and follows  EU legislation in areas such  as the free movement of  goods, services, people   and money.  •  It is not bound by EU  laws governing things like  agriculture and fisheries  or monetary union, but  it does have to make a  financial contribution to  the EU budget. It is also  liable to tariffs on exports  of a number of agricultural  products to the EU.  •  An independent study  commissioned by the  Norwegian government  has calculated that Norway  has had to incorporate  approximately 75% of  EU laws into domestic  legislation in return for  access to the EU market, but  with no vote or veto on the  creation of those rules.  The Switzerland model:   European Free Trade  Association membership •  Access to the single market   is governed by a series of  bilateral agreements, which  cover some, but not all,  areas of trade. For example,  Switzerland has agreements  in place for goods, but   not services.  •  It makes a financial  contribution to the EU,  although it has no vote or  veto over the creation of   EU rules.  •  This model is coming under  pressure as Switzerland  voted to limit immigration  from the EU and does not  automatically update its   own rules to match those   of the EU.  The World Trade  Organization model:   free trade agreement •  The World Trade   Organization (WTO) sets  out rules for international  trade that apply to all  members, so this is what   the UK would adopt, after   a period of transition, if   no bilateral agreements    has been the volatility in  financial markets caused   by the decision to call   a referendum.   This volatility makes  it more important for  businesses to manage   their financial exposures   to hedge transactions that  span the referendum.  What does   leaving mean? A useful approach when  considering what form the  UK relationship with the  remainder of the EU might  take in the event of a  leave   decision is to consider the  span of arrangements already  in place. The UK could  negotiate its own agreement  and not follow any of   these models.  The Norway model:   European Free Trade  Association with European  Economic Area membership •  As a member of the   European Economic Area,  Norway has access to the   France s economy minister,  has already proposed that  financial services could move  from London to Paris.  How long will a  renegotiation take? The short answer is: nobody  knows. The Treaty of the  European Union, Article 50,  is the much quoted source  of the answer: two years  to renegotiate, but: a) that  period can be extended by  mutual agreement; and   b) any renegotiation requires   a qualified majority of  member states.   A TRADING SUMMARY  •  The EU remains by far the UK s biggest  trading partner, accounting for 45% of  UK goods exported and 53% of imports.  •  In 2014, the UK imported 27% of its food  from the EU; while it exported £18.8bn  of foodstuffs.  •  The UK energy Net Import Dependency  in 2014 was 46.2%   that is, we imported  46.2% of our energy when converted to   thousands of tons of oil equivalent .  •  We imported 85% of coal used in the   UK in 2014, according to the Disasters  Emergency Committee, which was  sufficient to meet all coal used in  electricity generation; but little of this  energy originates in the EU.  •  The UK runs net internal and external  deficits. Its government debt at the   end of January 2016 was £1,581.6bn,  equivalent to 82.8% of GDP; an increase  of £52.7bn compared with January 2015.  Approximately one quarter of this is  funded by foreign lenders.

Previously Homeless   International, in 2014 the  charity rebranded and  relaunched, shifting its  business model from a  development charity funded  by grants to a social  enterprise. Using a business- focused model to provide  philanthropic support to   its partner network, Reall  expanded its operating  budget tenfold and increased  its expansion efforts  twentyfold over its 2010  numbers. Meanwhile, future  growth projections have  highlighted the need to  standardise and modernise  the methodology used for  tracking investments in  partner companies.   At first glance, Reall does  not seem to be the kind of  company that would require  a treasury management  system. Providing technical  assistance, advisory and  financial support to a series  of partner organisations    known as Community  Development Enterprises  (CDEs)   Reall s goal is to   build homes and encourage  commerce in Asia and Africa.  These CDEs operate locally,  performing functions ranging  from mobilising poor urban  communities; securing,  processing and servicing land;  developing vibrant, affordable   residential neighbourhoods;  and managing efficient end- user micro-mortgage systems  to enable locals to purchase  homes. While Reall will often  hold some share in them,  it does not usually have a  controlling interest, and   provides finance as a mixture  of debt and equity.   Transforming  philanthropy The year 2014 marked a  transformation in Reall s  operating philosophy towards  the CDEs. Changing scope  from a charity to a social  enterprise, Reall continues  to offer loans and financing  to the CDEs, but now does  so with a focus on funding  profitable business that it can  collect a return on. This gives  it the funding, which Reall  uses to reinvest in the CDEs,  but also assures it that the   money it invests supports  another goal: building  sustainable industry   in developing nations.  Combined with releasing  bonds and seeking investors  in their partner organisations,  this change has resulted in  a tenfold increase in Reall s  budget, and more than a  doubling of its efforts.    Given our future growth  projections, we needed to  find a treasury system that  was built for purpose rather  than continuing to manage   SMALLER CORPORATES AND NOT-FOR-PROFITS SOMETIMES NEED ADVANCED   TREASURY TECHNIQUES TO HELP WITH THE MORE UNUSUAL ISSUES THEY FACE.

As all of this happens with the  same set of templates in the  system, future agreements  are then standardised and  codified easily.   It has been labour  intensive, but taking each  contract one at a time and  working methodically  through each of them has  resulted, for me, in a better  understanding of not only  the system but also Reall s  contracts,” explains Lisa  Wesley, TMS project manager.   The system is user-friendly  and flexible enough for us to  be able to create the necessary   investments. With the help  of Lena we have successfully  captured each investment  contract within tm5 and each  FX transaction. Phase one of  the implementation process  is practically complete.”  Looking towards   the future With much done, but with  even more left to do, both  teams look towards the  future and what they want  to achieve.  Going forward,  Reall will leverage the existing  processes and establish a  long-term forecast, which  will include all investment,  funding and operational   These details were captured  in aging spreadsheets,  making tracking   much   less change control    incredibly labour intensive.  Using the implementation  project as an opportunity   to re-examine these  agreements gave Reall an  opportunity rarely afforded   to organisations: not  only could it define the  standardisation of its future  agreements, but it also  provided the opportunity   to look at past agreements  and review their structure.  To do this, the CDEs  were set up as separate  counterparties. Investments  were done with CDE  subsidiary entities, grouped  in counterparty groups.   This permitted Reall to   track its investment projects,  while still allowing for  flexibility in special project  arrangements. In addition,   it enabled Reall to map    and monitor programmatic  data (building units,   land, etc) against the  investment projects.   What we wanted to do was  standardise their processes,”  says Lena Pennington,  BELLIN project lead.  One of  our early tasks was to capture  existing partner investment  contracts along with their  interest and repayment  schedules. Now, Reall does  not only track outstanding  investment projects for  current movements, but also  uses this data to forecast  future cash flows, enabling  Reall to monitor currency and  interest exposures, and plan   our treasury function using   a variety of spreadsheets,”  says Peter Mujtaba, head   of systems for Reall.  Our   aim was to find a system   that was easy and quick to   set up and intuitive to use.  We followed a standard  request for proposal process  to research the marketplace  and were quick to find a  suitable solution for us with  BELLIN tm5. We selected   tm5 primarily because it was  cloud based and met our  business requirements out   of the box   and because  it came across as a good  cultural fit. The team  was approachable, keen,  knowledgeable and also  experienced in working with  other UK-based charities.”  Standardisation through  implementation At the heart of Reall s  operations are the CDEs,  and as such, a major focus   of the project was a push  for standardisation in  Reall s investment contracts  with them. There were  80 agreements, many of  which had been written up  with terms and conditions  according to local rules and  regulations, and interest   rates that differ according   to jurisdiction. These were  long-term investments with  cash flows projected over   five years or more, which  had not been standardised  globally, meaning that   details such as interest  calculations, which may  have been different between  partners, needed review.   Reall does not only track outstanding investment projects  for current movements, but also uses this data to forecast  future cash flows, enabling Reall to monitor currency   and interest exposures, and plan for future investments  flows,” explains Pennington.   This will serve Reall as a  basis for sensitivity analyses  on FX and interest rate risks.”    The reporting side  of the system is going  to be invaluable to the  organisation, not only for  seeking new investors, but  also for reporting back to  current investors, donors   and other stakeholders.   We have future plans  for further phased  implementations of  other functions within  the system, which will  be advantageous for   the organisation,”   explains Wesley.  Reall s shift in focus has  been transformative, not  least of which has come  through the application of  new technology.  We see  this a lot,” says Pennington.   Companies engage with us  because they need software,  but what the exercise   provides is the organisational  push to reorganise and  standardise operations.”   What lies at the end   of all this?  We hope   we ll be able to continue  to expand our efforts,” says  Wesley,  creating livelihoods,  catalysing economic  development and driving  economic empowerment   with each investment.”  To follow updates on Reall s  activities around the world,  visit www.reall.net, and for  more information on BELLIN  see www.bellin.com      Corporate financial management Investment  SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K  42  The Treasurer May 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Wanted: new  approaches to cash CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY LANDSCAPE ARE MAKING TRADITIONAL  MONEY MARKET FUNDS LESS VIABLE AND TREASURERS   WILL BE SEEKING NEW OPTIONS, SUGGESTS MARK ASHLEY   Since the credit crisis, prudent financial management by  corporates has led many to  accumulate substantial cash  reserves. Historically, these  reserves have been placed   with banks or in money  market funds (MMFs).  However, with bank credit  ratings having deteriorated  and potential regulatory  developments putting  pressure on traditional MMFs,  many cash investors are  seeking alternative solutions.  This has brought attention  to the repo market, which  can potentially offer greater  security for cash investors.  The repo market itself  faces challenges, but new  approaches are being  developed to offer attractive  cash-investment alternatives  that are secure and liquid, and  offer the potential for yield.  Challenges facing banks Basel III, developed by the  Basel Committee on Banking   Supervision, is a package of  standards that aims to reform  how banks approach capital  and liquidity. It is set for full  implementation in 2019, but  some regulations have already  taken effect, and many banks  are already following the rules  sooner than required. This is  having a significant impact   on how banks consider  investors wishing to place   cash with them.  Under the regulations,  there are several parameters   that define how much capital  a bank sets aside to cover its  liabilities. Core or strategic  cash incurs a higher charge  than operating cash, as it  is deemed more likely that  institutions will withdraw it  during times of market stress.  As a result of Basel III,  banks are less willing to take  on cash investments with  maturities of less than three  months as they incur higher  capital charges, preferring  instead to offer three-month   maturities or longer. Where  banks are accepting short- term cash investments, in  some instances, these banks  are offering less yield to   cover the cost of these new  capital charges.  On top of regulatory  pressure, many bank credit  ratings have deteriorated  in recent years. This has  put pressure on the ability  of corporates to diversify  counterparty risk given  limits based on credit ratings   Repo counterparty  Cash investor  Bank intermediary  Receives spread between repo rate and  reverse repo rate  Reverse repo rate + collateral (UK government debt)  O/N 1 wk  40  30  20  10  0 1 mth 3 mths 6 mths 9 mths 12 mths  For illustrative purposes only.

The  interest rate they receive is  known as the reverse repo   rate (see Figure 1, on page 42).   Historically, a bank has  typically intermediated  between both sides of the  transaction, taking a spread   as the cost of its involvement.  In effect, reverse repos are   a form of short-term lending  to a counterparty that provides  collateral (such as gilts) as  security. If the counterparty  defaults, the investor holds  the gilts: this compares well  with other investments,  which typically do not offer  comparable security.  The repo market, however,  faces its own challenges.   The introduction of   Basel III regulations has  adversely affected banks   with regard to repo  transactions, as it requires  them to hold capital against  their gross repo book  even if there are offsetting  exposures. This has led to  repo transactions becoming  more costly for banks, and this  increased cost has been passed  on to counterparties through  a widening of the bid-offer  spread on repo. As can be seen  in Figure 2 (left), at maturities  of one month and beyond,  this spread widening has   been considerable.  In addition, while investors  would typically prefer gilts   as security, transactions are  often arranged with collateral  that is less secure than gilts,  such as low-quality bonds or  even equities.   It has become clear that if  transactions can be arranged  without bank involvement,  it should be possible for  counterparties on both sides  of a repo transaction to enjoy  better terms.  These changes have prompted  an outflow of cash from US  prime MMFs.  European regulators are  following the lead of their US  counterparts, and it is widely  expected that regulations for  MMFs, currently being drafted  and set to be proposed soon,  will follow a similar model.  It is clear that if MMFs are  required to apply liquidity  triggers, redemption fees or  convert to variable NAVs,  corporate investors may have  to reassess whether they are  suitable vehicles for their   cash holdings.  Cash investment and   the repo market Given these conditions, cash  investors have been looking  for alternative solutions to  meet their requirements, and  their focus has turned to the  gilt repo market.  A repo is typically a bilateral  trade. One party sells an asset  to another party and agrees   to buy the asset back in the  future with interest. For the  party buying the asset and   contained within many  treasury policies.  Challenges facing MMFs The challenges facing banks  have led many larger cash  investors to consider MMFs,  but these are also facing   some headwinds.  Historically, MMFs have  offered a stable net asset value  (NAV) with daily liquidity,  meaning they were appealing  to cash investors seeking both  security and liquidity. But  during the financial crisis   in 2008, some US MMFs saw  the value of their holdings  fall significantly, resulting  in them requiring financial  support to maintain their  constant NAV. One fund, the  Reserve Primary Fund,  broke  the buck  and could no longer  maintain its constant NAV.   In the US, regulations due  to be implemented later this  year will lead prime MMFs  to adopt variable NAV status,  apply liquidity triggers that  limit investor withdrawals  if short-dated assets drop  below a certain proportion  of the portfolio assets,  and redemption fees. The  exception is funds that   invest only in treasuries,   which will be allowed to  maintain constant NAV status.   Mark Ashley is head of  institutional business  development UK & Ireland  at Insight Investment  As a result of Basel III, banks are less willing to take   on cash investments with maturities of less than   three months as they incur higher capital charges  In light of this, some cash  investors have opted for  cutting out the intermediary  by trading directly with a  counterparty, and repos/ reverse repos are being traded  directly at superior rates as a  result. However, this approach  is typically limited to larger,  well-resourced investors,  which are able to analyse the  credit quality of a counterparty  and to manage the legal  infrastructure that lies at the  heart of repo transactions.  Another approach is the  creation of peer-to-peer  platforms, which aim to   match cash investors and   cash borrowers. These are   still largely in development.  A new approach In our view, treasurers looking  to meet the standards of  security and liquidity, with  yield following some way  behind, should be prepared  to consider new approaches  to the repo market. Ideally,  these would potentially  offer the security of gilts  as collateral (via an MMF  vehicle) as against traditional  unsecured cash investments  or those offering low-quality  assets as collateral. At  Insight, we have been helping  treasurers enhance their cash- investment options without  compromising on appropriate  investment standards.

In this, the first of two  articles on the role of   collateral in corporate  treasury, I will look at  the nature of the changes  impacting the market now  and over that 12- to 18-month  time frame, and comment on  how innovation is bridging the  gap between the new and old  operating paradigms.  IN THE FACE OF REGULATORY CHANGE, RENEWED FOCUS ON COLLATERAL  MANAGEMENT COULD BRING EFFICIENCIES ALONG WITH RISK    AND COST REDUCTION, ARGUES KARL WYBORN  SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K  Corporate financial management Investment  For some time now, where  collateral is concerned,  market commentators (and  scaremongers) have been  commenting on the timing  and impact of forthcoming  regulatory changes and how  they will affect treasury  management. Despite all the  negative forecasts it seems,  with few exceptions for  corporate treasurers at least,  that management of collateral  has remained broadly  unchanged during this period.  In fact, I d argue that, despite  delays, the status quo will be  challenged over the next 12  to 18 months. What is more,  from a corporate treasurer  perspective, by leveraging   advancements being made  in the field of collateral  management, it is possible to  materially reduce cost and risk  and, at the same time, increase  efficiency without major  investment in new technology  or material disruption to the  overall strategic direction of  the business.  To better evaluate the  significance of the changes  that are taking place, first   let us understand and assess  the role of collateral where   it is used to support financial  markets activity.  In short, collateral is   an exchange of risk. Users  of collateral are replacing  counterparty credit exposure   with a series of other  risks associated with the  management of the collateral  itself. The concept being  that these new risks, which  are operational, legal and  liquidity related in nature,  can be directly managed  where credit exposure  cannot. Until recent times,  this pact has been relatively  straightforward to manage  for most corporate treasury  functions. The benefits have  been material   where the  values of collateral have  remained quite modest,  where available liquidity has  not caused undue concern  and where the operational  processes associated with        www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer May 2016 The Treasurer  45  the new financial  landscape   could (or perhaps should) be  considered an opportunity. As  is often the case, innovation  is at the heart of the more  exciting advancements that  are being made.  Very broadly speaking,   it is possible to divide these  advancements between  new technologies and new  infrastructures, with both  terms being used in their  widest possible sense.  Whether technology or  infrastructure, however,   the objective remains the  same: that is to support/ facilitate the ongoing market  activity in light of the new  operating models created   by the new regulation.  Whether any given  corporate treasury function  can simply continue on   a business as usual basis   is broadly a function of the  nature or scale of its specific  trading activity, ie whether   its trading activity has   a focus on non-financial  counterparties with a positive  or negative trading threshold.  In a second article, we will  evaluate what options are  available now to help redress  the balance between the   risk versus reward and the risk   versus cost dynamics of the  use of collateral, and what  might act as a trigger for their  adoption. It will argue that  by leveraging some of the  new solutions available, the  corporate treasury function  can reduce risk and cost  without material disruption   to other activities.   requirement (for the largest  users of swaps) to exchange  initial margin bilaterally.  From a corporate treasury  perspective, the impact  of these changes will be  correlated to the instruments  traded along with the scale of  that activity. For a vast majority  it is likely, in the near term  at least, to involve a higher  frequency of margin calls  for non-cleared transactions  (perhaps from zero) and the  appointment of one or more  OTC derivatives clearing  brokers.1 Both requirements  (or indeed each individually)  will lead to higher values of  collateral being demanded.  It is the second-order  effects of the new regulations,  however, that are causing the  nearer-term challenges. Much  has been written about the  zero (or lower) interest rates  and quantitative easing that  have defined central bank  policy for many years now. No  let-up is forecast for some time  to come. The response from a  number of treasury functions  has been to use repos as a  means of securing (albeit still  modest) enhanced returns as  an alternative to bank deposits  or money market funds. Repos  clearly involve some element  of collateral. Again, dependent  upon size, the ongoing  margining of  in-flight  repos is  becoming more commonplace  among treasurers who are  keen to avoid the credit risks  that are created through mark- to-market of collateral.  In addition to the above,  those users of futures and  options (and, in the future,  cleared OTC transactions) are  subject to some rather ugly  second-order impacts created  by the new capital rules  impacting clearing brokers.  In short, where cash is used  as collateral, a clearing broker  incurs far higher costs under  Basel III (as a result of the  liquidity coverage ratio).  Many treasurers have  already witnessed the  response from these same  clearing brokers, which is to   encourage the use of securities  as margin wherever possible  and discourage the use of  cash buffers, historically  used to avoid the operational  headaches of moving margin  every day. This is, of course,  in tandem with many clearing  brokers raising minimum  fees and trimming their client  bases to only those institutions  that pay the higher fees.  Notwithstanding the obvious  challenges that increased fees  and reduced access to clearing  brokers represents, the use of  securities as collateral, while  delivering a desirable benefit,  represents a meaningful  operational challenge for  many treasury units.  In line with the comments  above, while these second- order effects are perhaps  more apparent now, the  new regulations driving the  first-order changes will be  implemented over the next  18 months or so, and hence  will serve to compound the  challenges that some corporate  treasury functions face as they  go about their core business.  In a nutshell So, regulators  responses   to the global financial crisis  have had the effect of making  the use of collateral far  more commonplace than  was historically the case.  This expansion in the use  of collateral brings with  it an increase in cost and  risk. Where, in turn, these  increases negatively impact  the exchange of risk pay-off  that collateral represents, a  solution is required to redress  the balance. Where there is   no solution, there is the (well- documented) possibility that  the use of collateral starts to  increase the overall risks that  any given institution faces.  Needs must when   the devil drives In broad terms, where  we might categorise this  expansion of the use of  collateral as a challenge, the  various industry responses to   Karl Wyborn is MD and   head of sales at CloudMargin  the exchange of margin have  been straightforward.  Shifting sands The changes impacting  collateral management as it  relates to a corporate treasury  can be divided between first- order and second-order effects  (with ironically the second- order effects being, currently,  at least, more apparent) and  between cleared and non- cleared instruments, ie repo or  non-cleared OTC derivatives  and futures and options, and  cleared OTC derivatives.  Let us primarily consider  first-order versus second-order  effects. First-order effects  relate directly to those changes  that the regulators, globally,  are looking to implement to  make markets safer. These  range from the mandate  to clear all vanilla OTC  derivatives to the mandatory  exchange of variation margin  on OTC derivatives and the   Definitions explained  Variation margin   the mark-to- market difference on a portfolio.  Initial margin   the sum of  money that could conceivably   be lost over a defined period,  post a default. The period is  defined by regulation and differs  by instrument from one to   20 days or more. Critically, it is   a forecast rather than a function  of currently observable market  values. The calculation of this  forecast and the agreement   with a counterparty (where   their forecast may differ) is   a material challenge for those  market participants captured   by these regulations.  The liquidity coverage ratio  refers to highly liquid assets   held by financial institutions   in order to meet short-term  obligations. It is designed to  ensure that financial institutions  have the necessary assets on  hand to ride out short-term  liquidity disruptions.  1 Whether this relates to whether the institution   is an NFC- or an NFC+. For more information, refer  to www.esma.europa.eu. The reality is, however,  irrespective of whether an institution is captured  by the regulations   they are not immune from the  impact. Banks will charge more for uncollateralised  transactions for a host of reasons.

You have been looking forward  to this meeting for a while, as several of  your projects are nearing completion and  things generally are ticking along well, but  then there is your pension scheme. If you  are like most companies in the UK, the  news on this front will not be good.   The Pension Protection Fund estimates  that defined benefit pension scheme  deficits have increased from £158bn  in May 2013 to £302bn in March 2016.  Although deficits fluctuate, they have  increased by £80bn from the start of  the year to the end of March alone. This  increase can be seen in the context of  the near £190bn that companies have  contributed to their respective schemes  since 2008.  While the pension scheme may feel like  the proverbial black hole, your situation  does not have to be all bad news. On the  bright side, FDs   compared with other  stakeholders involved in pension schemes    can think more holistically and consider  how the pension scheme fits into the  wider capital structure of the company.  Within this wider context, an interesting  question to ask is whether there are ways  you can transform your pension deficit  into a more attractive liability.  One way this can be accomplished is by  funding a pension deficit through a bond  issue or other form of financing and then  undertaking a buyout with an insurance  company. A buyout, which is achieved  with the help of specialist advisers, would  transfer the responsibility of meeting your  pension obligations to an insurer, thereby  enabling you to remove the deficit from  your balance sheet. Companies in the US,  such as Kimberly-Clark, have used this  approach to replace their volatile pension  debt with contractual debt. A similar  rationale exists in the UK.  UK pension deficits have several  unattractive characteristics compared  with other forms of debt, which could  make this course of action attractive. First   Exchanging uncertainty  for certainty  JOHN TOWNER EXPLAINS HOW UNDERTAKING A PENSION BUYOUT CAN TRANSFORM   A COMPANY S PENSION DEFICIT INTO A MORE ATTRACTIVE AND STABLE LIABILITY  and foremost, pension debt is risky and  volatile. A pension scheme s liabilities are  a complex combination of interest rate,  inflation, longevity and other investment  risks, which are difficult to hedge, let  alone manage. While pension trustees  and their advisers have made great  strides over the past 10 years increasing  risk management within schemes, they  nonetheless continue to struggle with  low interest rates, volatile markets and  increasing life expectancies, as evidenced  by persistent deficits.  Secondly, the covenants that underpin  pension deficits are difficult to control.  Trustees have considerable power  under UK pension regulation to call on  sponsoring companies to make extra cash  contributions when deficits arise; not to  mention the regulations themselves are  subject to change. In addition, pension  deficits tend to arise in less favourable  economic environments at exactly the  same time that a company may have less  cash on hand.  Finally, the costs of running a pension  scheme are significant and often  underappreciated. To keep a pension  scheme running, an entire food chain  must be sustained. Asset managers,  consultants, actuaries, administrators,  lawyers and dealing counterparties all  extract fees before any investment   return is generated, irrespective of how  successful (or not) the pension scheme    is at generating return. For many pension  schemes, these costs can run in excess of  0.50% per annum. While this may not feel  like much, the scheme will essentially leak  this amount every year, and if expenses  were provisioned for in the valuation, they  would have the effect of adding another  7.5% to the value of the liabilities today   for a typical pension scheme.  For these reasons, demand from  sponsoring companies for pension  buyouts and other insurance solutions  remains high. Over the past three years,  more than £30bn in pension obligations  have transferred from UK company  balance sheets to insurance companies.  A more holistic funding strategy as  described above could help your company  exchange a volatile and expensive liability  for a more stable one. In the current era  of share buybacks and other financial  engineering, a straightforward pension  buyout may just deliver greater value   to shareholders.   Financial risk management Manage risks  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer May 2016 The Treasurer  47  IK O  N  IM  A G  ES /M  AT T   K EN  YO N  John Towner is  head of origination  at Legal & General    Financial risk management Manage risks  SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K  48  The Treasurer May 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  A smoother ride In their seminal work,  Nobel prize-winning  economists Franco   Modigliani and Merton Miller  (M&M) argued that in a  perfect capital market, where  there are no taxes and no  contracting costs, such as  those associated with  bankruptcy, a firm s choice   of financial policy does not  affect its market value. As a  firm s hedging policy involves  the issue of financial claims  against a firm, it is also a  component of its financing  policy. Therefore, the M&M  proposition can be extended  to hedging.   We might argue that, if a  shareholder can buy and sell  risk on the same terms as  firms, no service is provided  to shareholders by corporate  hedging. A shareholder can  obtain  home-made hedging   by hedging for their own  account, implying that the  corporate hedging decision  is irrelevant. Furthermore,  since value creation in the  M&M world takes place on  the asset side of the balance  sheet (through the realisation  of positive net present value  projects), hedging as part of  the firm s financing policies  cannot create value per se.  However, this view of  hedging seems to be at  variance with what we  observe in practice. For  example, my research on  hedging, which examines the  financial statements of listed  UK non-financial firms over  the period 1995-2015, reveals  that more than 75% of firms   used derivative instruments  for hedging. So perhaps  there s a country-specific  reason why companies hedge.   Hedging has the potential  to increase value by reducing  external claims to the cash- flow stream, flowing from  the firm s assets and, in doing  so, facilitating investment in  value-enhancing projects. And  in the UK context, it seems to  have particular relevance in  relation to risk management  around potential corporate  financial distress.   Financial distress occurs  when a firm s income cannot   cover its fixed claims, that   is, interest payments on   debt capital, and repayment   of principal and other fixed  contractual payments.   Firms with lower interest   cost coverage, along with  greater variability of cash  flows, are more likely to  find themselves in financial  distress. By reducing cash- flow variability arising   from exposure to volatility   in exchange rates, interest  rates and commodity   prices, hedging lowers  the likelihood of the firm  encountering financial   distress and, in turn,   lowers the expected costs  of financial distress. This  decrease in expected financial  distress costs increases   the firm s expected cash   flows, and so benefits the  firm s shareholders.   Direct and indirect costs Financial distress costs  can be categorised into  direct and indirect costs.  Direct costs consist of all  the costs pertaining to  the administration of the  bankruptcy process, for  example, accounting and  legal fees, and management s  time spent on the bankruptcy  procedure. However, even  if the firm does not actually  experience bankruptcy,   the perception of having   a high likelihood of default  can impose substantial  indirect costs on the firm.  These might come in the  form of lost market share  as customers switch their  purchases to rival firms   or suppliers tightening   credit terms, leading to   an increase in working   capital requirements.   Loan covenants may  also be triggered as a firm  approaches financial  distress, which might result  in costly refinancing. These  indirect costs will increase  at an accelerating rate as  the likelihood of financial  distress grows. Firms with a  higher probability of financial  distress and higher financial  distress costs will generate  larger benefits from hedging,   COMPANIES BASED IN COUNTRIES WITH BANKRUPTCY PROCEDURES  THAT FAVOUR CREDITORS OVER SHAREHOLDERS HAVE A GREATER  INCENTIVE TO HEDGE. DR AMRIT JUDGE LOOKS AT THE EVIDENCE     www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer May 2016 The Treasurer  49  and Air France-KLM was  65% hedged in 2014. Reports  suggest that British Airways  and Air France-KLM have not  made major changes to their  hedging plans in response to  falling oil prices.   Outside Europe, a similar  picture prevails, with Qantas  hedging 94% of its fuel  requirements for the first  half of 2015; Japanese ANA  Holdings hedging around  75%; and Virgin Australia   and Air New Zealand hedging  72% and 67% of their 2015  fuel exposures, respectively.  Notable exceptions are Etihad  and Chinese carriers, who  currently have no jet fuel  hedges in place. However, as  these airlines are backed by  their governments, it could  be said that they have fewer  concerns about future oil  price hikes.  Outside the US Even prior to the recent  decline in oil prices, airlines  in the US have traditionally  hedged on average a relatively  smaller fraction of their  fuel purchases than their  European competitors.  But financial distress costs  are higher in Europe (and  other countries) than in the  US. This, I believe, might  arise because of differences  in the bankruptcy code  between the US and other  countries. The bankruptcy  code in the US is regarded as  shareholder-friendly, because  it places greater emphasis on  management or shareholders  retaining control in the   event of default. This enables  firms to seek advice at an  earlier stage of financial  distress, resulting in a greater  chance of long-term survival.   Airlines began imposing   cost-cutting contract terms   on pilots and announced  plans to lay off more  than 4,000 mechanics  and other airport ground  workers as part of its  restructuring. During this  period, flight delays began   to rise and American s   on-time arrival rate of 59%  was significantly below the  85% achieved by United  Continental Holdings and   the 76% achieved by Delta   Air Lines, both operating  outside of Chapter 11.   This suggests that all  airlines should hedge their  financial price exposures,  such as jet fuel price, to avoid  the distress costs. However,  evidence suggests that  hedging practices between US  and European airlines vary.  Since 2014, jet fuel hedging  has been on the decline in  the US, in response, some  would say, to the decline in  its price volatility. American  Airlines has not hedged  its jet fuel exposure since  the second quarter of 2014;  United Airlines hedged 21%  in the fourth quarter of 2014;  Southwest Airlines hedged  25% of its fuel cost in 2014;  JetBlue Airways hedged just  15% of its second-quarter  2014 fuel consumption; and  US Airways, which recently  merged with American  Airlines, has gone without  hedging since 2008.   Airlines outside the US  are hedging a significantly  higher percentage of their  fuel costs, however. According  to recent analysis from Platts,  hedging remains a key tool  in managing fuel-price  exposure for Europe s major  airlines. Platts noted that  Ryanair had hedged 90%  of its fuel consumption for  the year ending March 2015;  Aer Lingus hedged 90% of  its requirements for 2015;  easyjet was 80% hedged in  2014; Lufthansa had covered  78% of fuel exposure for 2014;   and so have greater incentives  to hedge their risks.   The severity of the indirect  costs of financial distress  depends crucially on the  types of products a firm sells.  Firms that sell products that  carry warranties or include  service agreements enter  into long-term relationships  with their customers. The  value of these warranties  and service agreements will  be significantly diminished  if these firms are under  pressure, and potential  customers may turn to   more viable competitors.   This was the experience of  several motor manufacturers,  such as General Motors (GM)  and Chrysler, in the months  before and after they filed   for Chapter 11 bankruptcy  during the 2009 financial  crisis. In 2009, GM saw sales  halve and its US market   share fall from 22% to 18%   as customers switched to  more creditworthy rivals.  Speaking to The Guardian  in May 2009, GM s CFO,  Ray Young, said dwindling  sales were partly down to the  recession. He went on to say:   The other factor, frankly  speaking, is the increased  concern about bankruptcy   by consumers, particularly   in North America.”1   Airlines and hedging Indirect costs are also likely  to be higher for firms that  sell goods or services where  quality is important, but  difficult to determine prior  to consumption. Air travel  is a good example. Tickets  are purchased in advance of  travelling, but the customer  won t know whether the   travel experience is a good  one until they have flown.  The need to conserve cash  and manage costs is the focus  for most airlines, and the  pressure intensifies during   a downturn.   While in Chapter 11  bankruptcy in 2012, American   Dr Amrit Judge is associate  professor in finance at  Nottingham University  Business School  This suggests that all airlines   should hedge their financial price  exposures, such as jet fuel price,   to avoid the distress costs  When Chapter 11 works,  the company emerges from  the process as a financially  healthy company.   On the other hand,  the restructuring of  bankrupt companies via an  administrative receivership,  as practised in Canada, New  Zealand, the UK and in  various European countries,  is perceived as debt-holder- friendly because it confers  greater rights to creditors. If  these rules make liquidation  more likely for firms in  financial distress, then firms  in these countries potentially  face higher distress costs  than they would in the US.  So, firms based in countries  with bankruptcy procedures  that favour creditors over  shareholders have a greater  incentive to hedge.   Several interested  observers, such as those  holding senior positions in  the airline industry outside  the US, have argued that  Chapter 11 has enabled US  airlines to walk away from  many obligations, such as  billions of dollars of pensions  liabilities, resulting in a  considerable competitive  advantage. A number of  commentators are calling  for the UK to adopt a similar  procedure or at least  cherry- pick  the best aspects of the  Chapter 11 regime.   1 www.theguardian.com/business/2009/may/07/ gm-results-bankruptcy-fears    50  The Treasurer May 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Financial risk management  Identify and assess risks   Corporate treasurers  and risk managers use  a multitude of resources  available to them in order   to evaluate and implement  their companies  policies  towards currency exposure  and risk. Over the years,   it has staggered me just   how few use charting as   a tool within this process,  particularly as charting can  signify very clearly when   an event has or is in the  process of occurring that  could influence a currency s  direction for many months,  even years, into the future.   What is the standard  response given when I ask   why not?” Because it s a load  of tea-leaf-starring hoodoo?   I beg to differ. (Although   I would, because I make my  living covering the major  currency pairs, interest rates,  commodities and equity  indices.) So, let me give you  one recent example of why  charts are important.   The Bank of Japan The recent move from the  Bank of Japan to negative  interest rates came just one  week after I d flagged a really  important area on the chart  for the US dollar to Japanese  yen. On 20 January, we saw   THE THREE PRINCIPLES OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS  1 Prices move in trends, and trends persist Oil to $150, then all the way  back to $30 again; dotcom  and banking boom/bust  cycles; bond market bull run  (for the past 30-odd years!)…  There are so many examples  around, I don t think I need   to say any more on this one  apart from to reiterate: there  are three trends in the market:  up, down and sideways.   2 Market action  is repetitive Chartists look for recurring  patterns of behaviour, like the  three peaks that make up the   head and shoulders  in the  chart on page 51. This fits in  with the idea that markets are  driven by sentiment. After all,  as humans, we are all subject  to the age-old truth that we ll  continue to do the same thing  over and over again, even if  it s wrong every time.  3 Everything is in the price This is, for me, perhaps  the most important of the  three principles when it  comes to differentiating  technical analysis from more  traditional approaches to  market analysis because of  that word  everything . So that  includes sentiment. It doesn t  matter whether your rigorous  analysis of a situation says the  price of something is wrong  and should be higher; if the  market doesn t like it, it will  go lower.  SH U  TT ER  ST O  C Ka dip down to 115.975. Also   on this day there were some  whispers (I think out of  Davos) that the Bank of Japan  would do  anything required   to defend its currency and  sustain a weak yen. This  caused a spike higher, and   it was very timely because,   as I d flagged to my clients  in my commentary earlier  that day, 116.50 was a really  important line in the sand   on the chart. Had we  established below 116.50,   the chart (based on a   chart pattern that we see  repeatedly over many years,  across many markets) would   have given a sell signal with   a target of 106-something.   Central bankers look at  charts, hence the noise the  Bank of Japan made on that  day. They then made the  move to cut rates to negative  just a few weeks later, a move  that saw USD/JPY spike up   to 121.70.   In subsequent daily  commentary, I was able to  highlight that this spike could  just be temporary and it was  actually capped by something  Japanese chart watchers call  the  Ichimoku  cloud. It then  started selling off again, and  only a few days later, I was   once again shouting from   the rooftops to anyone that  would listen, that if USD/  JPY broke below 116.50, we  could see a serious move  lower. By 11 February, within  four days of breaking 116.50,  we were printing 111.00. This  was all on the charts. In fact,  the charts were screaming  this information. It wasn t   in the fundamentals because,  according to the vast majority  of analysts who don t use  charts, the Bank of Japan was  going to keep  slinging arrows   (to use the Bank of Japan  governor s phrase) to keep  things where they wanted   ALL MARKET TRENDS BECOME CLEARER ONCE YOU CHART THEM.

Sentiment is the key  word here. As per the  three  principles of technical  analysis  (see box on page 50),  everything known or thought  about an asset is in the  price. The price is set by the  minute-by-minute auction  that is open to everyone. And  markets behave irrationally  because they are driven by  human beings.   Technical analysis My job isn t to say whether   I think something should   be higher or lower next week  or next month. It is to say  whether it can   to look at   the probabilities. I do not  concern myself with the   why, but rather the where    where things have been and  where they may be going on  that basis.   Technical analysis has  stood up through crises   past and present, and the   trend sideways. This in itself  is valuable information,   and information that can  be used to manage risk- mitigation strategies.   As a chartist, I am also   able to approach my   analysis in a very different  way to economists and  those analysts looking at  the fundamentals. Their  approach is to say  this pair  should be higher because…”    which tends to mean that  they are likely to still be  saying the same thing a week  or a month later, even if it s  lower, and even if those lower  prices are clearly flagging up   a change in sentiment.   A chartist, on the other  hand, identifies certain price  points that would change  the trend, leading to a new  directional skew and outlook.  It is possible to be bullish  one week, and then to see  something happen the next  week that turns the chart  bearish. I believe it is a key  element of charting to have   them. On this occasion,   the arrows missed, and   the chart told us when and  where this started failing, as  well as offering an indication  of the risks attached to such  a failure.   We are living in a world  where central bankers appear  to be the most important  players in the markets (until  they re not) and I know  central banks look at charts,  so surely knowing that, the  rest of us need to watch the  currency charts also?  Chart analysis trends Chart analysis deals with  trends or, put another way,  they translate the hoodoo  into English, and are able  to identify, most of the  time, which of three trends  we are seeing. I say three  trends because markets can  go upwards, downwards or  sideways. It is not a binary  deal, and sometimes (in fact  some would argue up to   70% of the time) markets   advent of algorithmic   trading is testament to its  robustness. Universities   are increasingly adding it   to their business and finance  courses, and many businesses  now make sure their staff   has at least a working  knowledge of the subject,   or has access to analysts who  can offer a technical view  on market movements and  potential risks.   Despite the rise of the  machines, it is still people  that move markets, and   so markets will always   be at the mercy of the  irrationality of the human  mind; an irrationality that   can be best tracked with   a flexible but robust trend- following approach.

Borne out of political and  economic factors, such as  steady economic growth in  the UK, quantitative easing  (QE) in Europe and Greek  Grexit speculation, this  fruitful period for the pound  saw GBP/EUR reach a seven- and-a-half-year high in July  2015, when £1 bought €1.44.   Q1 of this year was a  different story, however, as  sterling failed to maintain   its bull run against the euro    as outlined in the chart on  page 53.  A range of events conspired  to put the pound under  considerable downward  pressure during the first three  months of 2016: concerns  over Chinese economic  growth once again reared  their ugly head; the UK  quarterly Inflation Report  revealed inflation running  worryingly close to 0%,  meaning expectations for  higher UK interest rates were  pushed back to 2017; and,  most notably, speculation  surrounding the outcome   of the upcoming referendum    dubbed  Brexit    on the   UK s membership of the   EU intensified.   Ever since UK prime  minister David Cameron  emerged from lengthy   negotiations with the  European Council in  February, clutching his list  of EU membership reforms,  and subsequently announced  the referendum will take  place on 23 June, significant  sterling volatility has ensued.  A trend fuelled by a  Leave    campaign that is gathering  considerable momentum  thanks to the backing of some  high-profile political figures,  and subsequent concerns  among investors that a  departure from the EU could  have a detrimental impact  upon sterling, have added to   the uncertainty. For example,  in the three days following  London mayor Boris  Johnson s announcement that  he would be throwing his  weight behind a Brexit, the  pound plummeted to a seven- year low against the US dollar,  falling from 1.4330 to 1.3879.    04.01.2016 18.01.2016 01.02.2016 15.02.2016 29.02.2016 14.03.2016 28.03.2016  1.40000  1.38000  1.36000  1.34000  1.32000  1.28000  1.30000  1.26000  1.22000  1.24000   www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer May 2016 The Treasurer  53  general election and the  Scottish referendum before  that. If we look back to 2014  as a recent case study, the  pound dropped to £1 = €1.24  days before the ballot as polls  began to suggest a surprise  vote to leave the UK was in  the offing, before surging to a  two-year high versus the euro,  as Scotland decided against  independence. This scenario  could well be repeated in  June, and most market  forecasters expect it, with  average predictions for GBP/ EUR being 1.35 and GBP/USD  1.46 by the end of the year.   What s more, the GBP/ EUR rate could be provided  with further support by  events elsewhere in Europe:  namely ongoing QE in the  eurozone and the renewed  threat of a Grexit, as Greece  struggles to meet the fiscal  targets required by the  bailout programme. We  believe there will be a need  for FX management services  whatever the outcome of  the EU referendum. The EU  referendum is a democratic   referendum may continue  to direct negative sentiment  towards the pound. With this  in mind, market analysts are  forecasting a tempestuous  two months ahead. In terms  of sterling s relationship with  the single currency market,  forecasts suggest that the  rate could trade as low as 1.15  before the vote.   As markets come to terms  with the prospect of a Brexit,  we should try and gain  some perspective. Yes, our  immediate concern is the  coming weeks leading up to  the referendum itself, and  its influence on the pound.  However, both ongoing  opinion polls   albeit by a fine  margin   and political betting  markets, which have become  increasingly respected  following the pollsters   mistakes in last year s general  election, indicate that the  public will vote for Britain   to remain in the EU.  If the UK does choose to  dissolve its membership of  the EU, some experts predict  a hangover to the tune of a  20% slump overnight in the  value of sterling. However,  if the public decides against  upsetting the status quo  and votes to maintain the  country s position in Europe,  the pound could rally given  the precedents of last year s   The potential impact of  the pressure applied to the  UK s relationship with its  largest trading partner has  been reflected in the global  currency markets. By early  March   when £1 stood at €1.28  and £1 = $1.39   the pound had  fallen by 4.7% against the euro  and 4% against the US dollar  since the start of the year.   What does the remainder  of 2016 hold for sterling? This downward spiral has  turned into more of a market  roller coaster as the chance  of a Brexit becoming a reality  mounts. The majority of  recent opinion polls indicate  the UK population will  choose to stay in Europe, but  the figures are tight enough  and the number of undecided  voters high enough that a  shock exit is not out of the  question. Consequently, by   7 April the GBP/EUR pair  had dropped to its lowest  level   £1 = €1.23   since June  2014; although, to further  highlight market uncertainty,  in the month of April, sterling  has recovered by almost 5%  against the single currency.  The official campaign  period began on 15 April  and this should add to the  ongoing turbulence, while it  is predicted that nervousness  surrounding the result of the   Lee McDarby is managing  director of corporate  international payments   at moneycorp. www. moneycorp.com/uk/ business.

Managing market  volatility Sterling volatility in 2016  presents a challenge for  treasurers of companies that  trade internationally, as they  seek to protect their cash  flows. For UK businesses that  import, the pound s recent  misfortune could have had a  detrimental impact on their  bottom line if they were   not hedged. For example,   at the early January rate of   £1 = €1.36, €200,000 worth of  stock would have been priced  at £147,000; whereas at the  April rate of £1 = €1.23, the  cost would have increased to  £162,500. That s a difference  of £15,500 in just a matter  of weeks, simply due to  fluctuating exchange rates.

Calculations can either be (i) stepped or (ii) banded. Banded interest is better for customers, because the higher rates are  applied to the entire balance.  Most corporate groups also have large numbers of bank accounts.  Pooling balances for interest calculations, where possible, will also   give significantly better results for customers.  Group tiers Let s develop a simple example, based on a recent exam question.  Holdco plc has one subsidiary, Sub A. Both companies have  accounts with the same bank. Interest is currently applied on  a stepped basis on the individual average surplus balances of  £390,000 and £510,000.  Amount (£000)  Interest rate per annum  Up to 250 0.1%  250-500 0.2%  500-1,000 0.5%  1,000-2,000 0.9%  Calculate the annual benefit to the group of introducing a notional  pooling arrangement where interest is applied on a banded basis.  Certificate in International Cash Management, April 2015, Q3(a) simplified extracts  Simple and best The simplest calculation gives us the best result, so we ll start   there. Pooling and banding, applied together, results in the highest  interest earnings.  Pooling the balances of £390,000 and £510,000 gives a total  balance of £900,000. This falls into the 0.5% per annum interest tier.  Banded interest means applying the 0.5% to the entire £900,000.  Annual interest enjoyed is: 900,000 x 0.5%  = £4,500  Our entire group balances of £900,000 are all earning interest   at this beneficial rate. These are the grey  Banded and pooled  bars   in each of our two charts on page 57.  Complex and worse Without the banding and pooling arrangements, the deal is worse  for the customer in two ways: (1) Credit interest is applied in steps (increments) rather    than banded. (2) Accounts are treated individually, rather than being pooled.  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer May 2016 The Treasurer  55  Sweat and tiers MANY CORPORATES ARE HOLDING A LOT OF CASH. THE DIFFERENT WAYS TIERED INTEREST RATES ARE   APPLIED MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE TO TOTAL INTEREST EARNINGS. DOUG WILLIAMSON EXPLAINS  Stepping down Stepped interest means only the incremental amounts in higher   tiers earn interest at the higher rates. Let s consider Holdco (H)   on its own.  Tier (£000)  H balance (£000)  Up to 250 250  250-500 140  500-1,000    390  Only £140,000 earns at the better 0.2% rate (coloured blue). Most  of the balance (£250,000) goes into the worst-earning tier at 0.1%  (coloured pink).  Many candidates got this wrong, awarding themselves too much  credit interest at this stage.  Divided we fall Now let s bring back Sub A. Without pooling, the stepped balances  in A s account are treated similarly to H s. But A is calculated  individually, ignoring the account held by H.  Tier (£000)  H (£000)  A (£000)  Total (£000)  Rate Interest   earnings   (£)  Up to 250 250 250 500 0.1% 500  250-500 140 250 390 0.2% 780  500-1,000   10 10 0.5% 50  390 510 900 1,330  Interest-earning power is substantially reduced. Most of the total  group balances now earn at the very worst rate of just 0.1%.  Only a small increment is earning interest at the favourable   rate of 0.5%, compared with the entire £900,000 under banding   and pooling. This results in much lower interest earnings     just £1,330.  These are the multicoloured  Stepped  bars in our two charts   on page 57.  Handy benefit The annual benefit of pooling and banding is £3,170. This is  the difference between the £4,500 earned under the better  arrangements, and £1,330 under the worse ones.  This kind of calculation is important in practice and frequently  examined.

He attributes his own study successes to: • Starting early; • Family support; • Transferring skills; and • Making sacrifices.  Start early When studying, I put an hour in early   usually 6-7am, to make sure   I d always got something done should the work day get away from me.  Where possible, I d also book an office for an hour at lunchtime to study.  Family support One Easter, before the April sitting, I needed the long weekend to  study. To support my effort, my wife and children went on holiday.   I sat, properly under exam conditions, eight past papers, morning   and afternoon in the correct order and exact time slots on consecutive  days from Good Friday to Easter Monday. I also read through my  scripts critically against the model answers in the evenings. It was  exhausting! But absolutely worth it.  Transfer skills I d applied these practices successfully to earlier studies, on advice  from a colleague I respected. It was a no-brainer to transfer them   to my ACT work, knowing: • It was for a limited period; and • I really wanted the qualification.  I got clear passes in both my MCT exams.   Sacrifice All this led me to have little sympathy for any of my team members  who claimed they  hadn t been able to fit in the study required”. That s  simply unacceptable. You really do have to decide whether you want  the qualification enough to make the necessary sacrifices, or not.  Particularly if your employer is paying.  GK, former director, Big 4 advisory firm  One more company Let s follow this good advice by pushing on with our earlier group  case study. We ll introduce one more group company. Say our new  company has a surplus cash balance of £245,000.  What s the annual benefit of pooling and banding now?  Banded and pooled Total pooled balances are now:  0.39m + 0.51m + 0.245m  = £1.145m  This total £1.145m falls into the tier above £1m, and the interest  rate of 0.9% in our  Group tiers  table, on page 56.  Banding means the 0.9% applies to the entire £1.145m.  So, interest earnings are: 1,145,000 x 0.9%  = £10,305  Individual and stepped Now, turning to the individual and stepped  arrangement   on this basis, the additional  £245,000 is all in the very lowest tier   below  £250,000   earning just 0.1%.  Interest on this incremental amount is: 245,000 x 0.1%  = £245  Added to the £1,330 we calculated before, total interest earnings  under the individual and stepped arrangements are now:  1,330 + 245  = £1,575  More rewards The total benefit of pooling and banding becomes £8,730. Again, this  is the difference between the handsome £10,305 now enjoyed under  pooling and banding, and the rather derisory £1,575 without them.  Well worth investing a little time and sweat to understand. Having  understood, make sure you always negotiate with your bank for the   most favourable basis. Banded will always be better. Notional  pooling will also be better, where permitted by local   regulations and offered by the bank.

How should we vote?”  Mr Treasurer demurred   not  least because he hated being  called Mr Money Man, but  mostly because he hadn t the  foggiest idea.  He thought about it long  and hard   in fact, he thought  about it so long and hard,  he felt as though his brain  had been hit by something  long and hard. He needed a  methodical approach: list the  pros and cons   the debits and  credits. He tried to remember  from his training days whether  debits went on the left and  credits on the right or vice  versa, but it was no use, and  no matter.  So he began…  Remain   debit. Leave   credit.  58  The Treasurer May 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  A vote to leave would create  uncertainty for years. You re a treasurer.

With the pound declining to record lows against trade-weighted averages last month, concerns  are mounting around what the next few years might bring, with more than a handful of corporates  already suggesting profits will be affected. Suddenly, the comfortably far-off effects of exiting the  EU aren t looking quite so comfortably far off.   Currency risks have edged up the agenda, and treasurers will be revisiting hedging arrangements.  Some will have more flexibility than others, but sadly, the global scene offers little in the way of  respite or reassurance. In just a few days, we will learn the outcome of the US election. Forecasters  have been leaning increasingly towards a Clinton win, but the populist element and the profound  sense of polarisation within the electorate of this unusually bile-filled election can t be totally  disregarded. On page 18, commentator Roland Hinterkoerner picks over Donald Trump s   spending intentions and weighs up the implications of an infrastructure spending spree fuelled   by Treasury bonds.   Into this mix, we re seeing the advances of some large-scale transactions. As I write, telecoms  giant AT&T is in talks with Time Warner for what would amount to an $85bn tie-up, while British  American Tobacco aims to buy back into the US tobacco market with a $47bn offer for Reynolds  American, in which it already holds a 42% stake.  The case for tobacco mergers and telecoms-content tie-ups resoundingly made, is the stage set  for a wave of deals across other sectors? Consolidation may prove a decent strategy for shoring up  market presence and spreading risk.  In our profile this month we talk to Rando Bruns, head of group treasury at German life sciences  group Merck, who knows a thing or three about acquisition funding. Merck s purchase of Sigma- Aldrich, finalised in 2015, was a bold move, 100% debt-financed. Bruns explains the mechanics  of the Sigma-Aldrich and other deals on page 20, as well as describing how he managed Merck s  relationship banks over the course of the deal, and the role that treasury can play in post- transaction integration.  On page 24, Sally Percy explores the role that the ACT and treasury professionals have played   on a public stage when they seek to shape and influence regulatory change, and on page 34, we   look also at the opening up of Iran in a post-sanctions era.

Sterling s post-referendum fall   in value halted over the summer  months only to begin again, against  growing political signals that   the UK will execute a  hard exit   from the EU and the single market.  Sterling hit a historic low in early  October against a trade-weighted  basket of currencies. The pound has  dropped by more than 15% against  the euro since the referendum.  Businesses that pay suppliers  with a weakened pound are finding   themselves increasingly   caught by the dilemma.  Sports Direct International, for  instance, reported that the flash  crash in the pound could cause  earnings at the sports retailer to  fall by as much as £35m.  Other businesses affected by  currency movements included  UK-based airline easyJet, which put  the cost of the declining pound at  around £90m for the year ending  16 September. Irish budget airline  Ryanair cut its profit forecast by 5%  ahead of its full-year results, citing  the drop in the pound as the cause.  According to research from  East & Partners, 80% of the UK s   biggest companies put hedges  in place ahead of the June   vote on the UK s EU  membership. Some  22% of SMEs also put  currency protection in   place in the run-up to   the vote.  However, for those companies  with arrangements due to expire,  questions around passing increased  costs onto their customer base   or facing diminishing margins   are heightened.  BRIEFING  06  The Treasurer November 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  { CONTEXT OF TREASURY }  CFOs TURN TO TREASURERS   FOR STRATEGY INPUT  Regulatory compliance,  economic uncertainty and the   interest rate outlook are among   the strategic issues where finance  heads increasingly turn to their  treasury counterparts, according   to a white paper from the  Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).  The study, Managing Risk in  Challenging Economic Times,   which was published last month,  sets out the spectrum of issues   on which CFOs consult treasurers.  Macroeconomic, regulatory and  technological challenges are not  just reshaping treasury s outlook,  it concluded, but they are also  changing the way the treasury  function interacts with the rest   of the organisation.  Compiled from a survey of   150 senior treasurers and 150   CFOs worldwide, the EIU s white  paper confirms that treasury s  partnership with the rest of the  business has strengthened.  Uncertainty about economic  growth is by far the top concern  that treasurers around the world are  dealing with at present, while low    or even negative   interest rates are  triggering significant policy changes  in the area of cash management.  Meanwhile, compliance and  other regulatory matters are taking  their toll on treasury resources, with  respondents saying they already  spend a lot of time on compliance.  Almost 80% expect their  compliance workloads to remain    as high as they are, or even to  increase.  This avalanche of   new regulatory requirements   has spawned a palpable sense   of frustration among many  treasurers,” the report s authors  said,  especially with regulation  that is seen as creating high  burdens without delivering any  tangible benefits.”  In addition,  Several [treasurers]  also worry that the higher  compliance costs, along with  higher capital ratios for financial  institutions, could cause banks to  become more selective.   Regulation is thus not just   seen as a nuisance, but also  as a potential threat to bank  relationships,” they concluded.   There will  be a period  of a couple  of years, or  perhaps even  longer, when  businesses  are uncertain  about the  final state  of our  relationship  with the  EU. During  that period,  we need to  support the  economy to  make sure  that consumer  confidence  remains.” UK chancellor Philip Hammond  (pictured above) signals a  temporary halt to austerity  in an effort to bolster the  economy as the country  prepares for Brexit in 2019. SOURCE: EVENING STANDARD,   3 OCTOBER 2016  SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K  WORDS  { CONTEXT OF TREASURY }  Businesses square up to rising   costs as pound falls to historic low     { CONTEXT OF TREASURY }  UK CFOs remain cautious in the wake of Brexit, survey finds    The latest quarterly survey of UK CFOs from Deloitte has  found that Brexit and economic  risks continue to exercise finance  heads, with investment and  hiring spend expected to decline  over the next year.  In the months since the   UK voted to leave the EU,   equity markets have rallied   and a raft of UK and global  economic indicators have  strengthened. However, CFOs  surveyed by the accountancy  firm said they continued to see  significant risk in the current  business environment.   The animal spirits of the  corporate sector took a battering  in the wake of the referendum  and, three months on, Brexit  continues to loom large for   the UK corporate sector,”   said Ian Stewart, Deloitte s   chief economist.  Brexit-related risks topped the  list of concerns of those surveyed,  with a corresponding impact on  corporate risk taking. Some 18%  of respondents said now was a  good time to take risk onto the  balance sheet, up from 8% in the  survey taken immediate after   the referendum. CFOs who took   part also said they expected to see  their spending on investments and  on hiring decline over the next  three years as a result of Brexit.  CFOs had a continued focus  on cost reduction and better  cash-flow management, with 47%  prioritising reducing costs and  42% putting increased cash flow  as their top concerns. However,  the percentage of CFOs who rate  introducing new products or  services, or expanding into new  markets as a strong priority has  risen from 27% to 39% since the  previous survey was published  just after the referendum.  {  CORPORATE FINANCIAL  MANAGEMENT }  UK rides high  in poll for  inbound M&A  investment  The UK has become the  second most popular country   for inbound M&A activity,  according to a poll from law   firm Allen & Overy.  The UK overtook Switzerland  in the rankings for the third  quarter of this year, as the fall  in the value of the pound made  UK assets more attractive to  international buyers, according  to the survey. Allen & Overy cited  the takeover of Premier Farnell by  US group Avnet Inc as evidence  of the UK s newly strengthened  position, after Avnet outbid Swiss  group Daetwyler.  Overall, though, deal values  have fallen 24% compared with  this time last year. In fact, 2015  saw a record-breaking amount   of large transactions, but all  regions have seen a slowdown   in deal activity this quarter. In   the US, there has been a 32%   fall in transaction values for   Q3 2016 compared with the   same period last year. China   has seen a 26% fall and Western  European deals have contracted  in value by 18%.  The report s authors cited  continued turbulence across the  political and economic climate,  including the long-term effects of  Brexit, an unusually contentious  US presidential race and concerns  around commodity prices and  faltering economic growth in  emerging economies.  { KEY FINDINGS FROM THE DELOITTE CFO SURVEY FOR Q3 2016 }  NUMBERS  71% expect the Bank of England  base rate to remain at or  below 0.25% in a year s time  $152trn   the   size of world debt, which  stands at more than twice   the size of the global economy,  according to the International  Monetary Fund  £285m     the amount of  credit card debt  written off in Q2  2016 in the UK,  according to The  Money Charity  47%   see reducing  costs in their  business as a  strong priority  88%   of respondents  rate the level of  external economic  and financial  uncertainty as  above normal  21,500    the number of Brits  who applied for Irish  passports over the  summer months,  double the number  of applicants for   the same period   the previous year  £250,000   the cash prize offered  by Lord Wolfson, CEO of Next, for the best  suggestion on how to ease congestion on  the UK s overcrowded road network  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer November 2016 The Treasurer  07  42% rate  increasing cash flow  as similarly important  39% also see  introducing new products or  services, or expanding into  new markets as a top priority  100 per week    the number of passenger  flights between the UK  and China, following a deal  between the two countries  aimed at encouraging trade  73%   the tariff  agreed by the EU on  Chinese steel imports  to protect European  manufacturers    08  The Treasurer November 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  { AROUND THE WORLD IN 30 DAYS }  SHENZHEN CONNECT, HOUSE OF LORDS, BRICS Shenzhen and Hong   Kong market tie-up Four of Asia-Pacific s largest  regulators have set the seal  on a stock market tie-up to  boost the flow of stock market  activity between Hong Kong  and Shenzhen, China. Set  for launch later this month,  Shenzhen-Hong Kong  Stock Connect, or Shenzhen  Connect, has been designed to  bridge the territories through  improved mutual market  access, enabling investors   to buy and sell eligible shares  listed in both China and Hong  Kong. The venture builds on  work already established to  bolster market cooperation  between Hong Kong and  China, via Shanghai Connect.   Shenzhen Stock Exchange  chairman Wu Lijun said:   Shenzhen Connect is a major  policy initiative by the Central  Government to promote  reform and opening up in   the capital market.”  House of Lords to   scrutinise Brexit impact The House of Lords  EU  internal market subcommittee   has launched an inquiry into  the implications of Brexit for  the UK s trade in services   with the EU.  The committee has been  hearing evidence from key  service sectors, including  professional business  services, aviation and  telecommunications, as well as  experts on EU law and global  economics, with the aim of  determining the implications  of different levels of market   access the UK might negotiate  with the EU. Key questions  under consideration include  which sectors are most  significant to cross-border  trade with the EU, and what  kind of non-tariff barriers  impact on trade.  The committee has  separately urged that the   UK parliament should be  actively involved in scrutinising  forthcoming negotiations,  rather than after the fact,    as proposed by the   UK government. BRICS leaders bullish Weighing against concerns in  the West around a flight from  globalisation, last month s  BRICS summit reaffirmed  the impact of emerging  economies on the world stage,  commentators argued.  The five heads of state from  Brazil, Russia, India, China and  South Africa met in Goa, India,  for the eighth annual summit  and spoke of the growing  momentum of the group,  while pledging to contribute  to institutions such as the New  Development Bank and the  BRICS Contingent Reserve  Arrangement as a means of  improving financial safeguards.  Roberto Jaguaribe, president  of the Brazilian Trade and  Investment Promotion Agency,  said there were two main  aspects to the group s impact  worldwide: the large number  of developing countries in  their respective region and  the fact that BRICS countries  themselves now represent 25%  of the world s GDP.

According to a statement from the Dubai  Islamic Economy Development Centre  (DIEDC) and pending regulatory approval,  Emirates Trade Bank will offer integrated  trade and commodity-financing solutions.   The bank will help Dubai meet its strategic  goal of supporting the Islamic financial  sector, while integrating investments towards  a doubling of UAE trade flows by 2020.   Sami Al Qamzi, DIEDC vice chairman  and director general of Dubai Department  of Economic Development, said:  The UAE  in general, and Dubai in particular, are   privileged to have a diversified, open and  flexible economy capable of addressing  international and regional challenges.   Emirates Trade Bank is set to reap  synergies from the strategic positioning  and advanced technical and logistics  infrastructure of Dubai, in its efforts to  finance international trade and commodity  flows   particularly through the UAE.”  DIEDC added that it  will continue to  support initiatives aimed at transforming  Dubai into the capital of the Islamic economy.   The UAE and the emirate of Dubai  have always been the leaders and pioneers  in the Islamic finance industry, with the  establishment of the first Islamic bank in   the world in the 1970s.”    China s growth slowdown   prompts deep concerns  While official figures from China  report a GDP of 6.7% for the third  quarter, consistent with the pace  of growth for Q1 and Q2 this year,  cracks in the numbers are beginning  to show, according to reports in   The New York Times and elsewhere.  Some commentators are  characterising the slowdown in  headline growth rates as dramatic,  sufficient to warrant major concern  for central banks, investors and  international corporates. Chief  among their worries is China s  burgeoning debt, which, if its current  pace of growth continues, may bring  China to the brink of a financial  crisis comparable with the global  crisis of 2008, with implications   for the wider economic community.  Controversially, China seems to  be pressing ahead with a scheme to  allow companies to exchange debt  for equity. Corporate debt currently  stands at around $18 trillion. Saudi s first bond issue finds favour In a record amount for an   emerging-market bond debut,  Saudi Arabia raised $17.5bn in   an international issue. The bonds,   which were issued in five-, 10- and  30-year tranches, were greeted with  enthusiastic demand and have been  widely seen as a successful example  of the kingdom s efforts to move  away from an oil-led economy to   a more diverse one.   The bond deal exceeds a $16.5bn  issue in Argentina in April and  comfortably eclipses the $9bn bond  sold in Qatar in May, and proves  that emerging-market debt is very  much in favour. Another notable  feature, according to a report in the  Financial Times, was the fact that  30-year debt proved more popular  than five- or 10-year debt, with   $6.5bn of investors  cash attracted  to the longer-tenor issue. US banks  earnings rally Q3 marked a return in fortunes for  Bank of America, whose net profits  rose to $5bn, its best quarterly  result since 2008. While JPMorgan  Chase and Citigroup saw lower net  profits than Q3 last year ($6.3bn  and $3.8bn respectively), all three  banks reported stronger sales from  bond trading. JPMorgan s results  were helped by record profits in  its commercial banking division, as  well as strong trading activity. The  bank reported an 8% YOY increase  in revenues.  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer November 2016 The Treasurer  09  MAKING  THE   NEWS  { CONTEXT OF TREASURY }  GLOBAL USE  OF RENMINBI  CLIMBS  Global business use of   the Chinese renminbi has   climbed by 7% since 2015, with  nearly a quarter of corporates  now using the currency to do  business with China, according  to figures from HSBC.   Reduced FX risks and costs  has emerged as the primary  motivating force behind   the growth.  However, only around two in  five corporates surveyed by the  bank said they were aware of  opportunities afforded by China s  Belt and Road initiative, with  only 7% of those businesses   that were aware of it working   on a Belt and Road strategy.  Out of the companies  developing strategies to  participate in Belt and Road  opportunities, European  corporates led the way with 12%  of  aware  businesses seeking   an early advantage. North  American firms were next at   9%. In Asia-Pacific, just 6%   of  aware  firms are making  strategic plans involving Belt   and Road opportunities.   Belt and Road projects  are already presenting huge  opportunities for companies  that can help develop physical  infrastructure,” said Noel  Quinn, chief executive of HSBC  Commercial Banking.  But  these are only the first steps. By  boosting connectivity, Belt and  Road will catalyse trade between  more than 65 countries that are  home to nearly two-thirds of  the world s population. For any  company seeking growth and  new customers, that s an exciting  proposition to explore.”  Chinese enterprises invested  $14.8bn on Belt and Road initiatives  last year, on infrastructure  projects that span 49 countries  and cover railway programmes,  logistics hubs and power  generation. China Development  Bank said it plans to contribute  $895bn in project funding.  { CONTEXT OF TREASURY }  HACKERS CLAIM NEW TERRITORY IN SUSTAINED  DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACK  Hackers demonstrated the effectiveness of a new  method of cyberattack last month, disabling   multiple websites when they targeted US domain  name service provider Dyn and rendered key  e-commerce inaccessible for hours at a time.  The cyberattack that targeted Dyn temporarily  silenced key websites, including Twitter, Spotify,  Netflix and news sites for the Financial Times and  The New York Times in a so-called distributed  denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.  Dyn provides a key service to some of the   world s busiest websites, by monitoring and  routing internet traffic. Its servers translate internet  addresses that humans can read and remember   into the IP addresses used by the internet. The   New York Times reported that the attack used   many thousands of internet-enabled devices,   including cameras, baby monitors and home  routers, infecting them with software that then  flooded the service provider with traffic at the  hackers  command.  The first attack hit the service for two hours and  was followed by  a second attack  two hours later.   DDoS   attacks have  risen by   129% YOY,  according to  a report by  Akamai, a  web security  company.    TECHNICAL BRIEFING  10  The Treasurer November 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Noises continue over Brexit: we now have a date for Article 50  notification; the rest of the EU has realised that the impact may   not be as muted, or as benign, as expected. However, the world  awaits elections in the US, France and Germany, with the risk  that the Western economies move away from the macroeconomic  policies prevalent for the past 60 years.

Corporate treasurers  have been impacted   by these changes, often,   we believe, unfairly  because they were   neither the cause of the  FC, nor revealed any  systemic risk during it.  They have been drawn  into complex reporting  systems and must,  on occasion, provide  collateral   solutions   that are designed to    However, is this about  to go into reverse? The  Brexit referendum  revealed a significant  electorate within the  UK that wants borders  re-established, physically  and economically.  Although Britons have  long been harangued  by their European  neighbours for insisting  on being different,  perhaps they were just   at the front of the train.   The US goes to the polls  this month and whoever  wins may find that  the economically (and  politically) disengaged  have become the majority,  with the resultant shift in  policy that requires. The  far right may win control   in the French election in  2017 and seek the same  physical barriers within  the EU for which Britons  voted. Finally, German  elections are increasingly  putting Chancellor  Merkel s assertion that  Germany could and  should welcome refugees  from outside of the EU  under strain.  The return of  protectionism Back to Brexit, the  principle concern for the  financial services sector is  that financial regulation  may diverge so that not  only passporting, but   also equivalence (see   The Treasurer, October  2016, page 11), may come  under attack.   Divergent financial  regulation may oblige  financial service  providers to fragment  their businesses across  countries with a resultant  increase in cost, not   only of administration,  but also as a result of  tailoring their services   to domestic laws.   This risk may also  apply to the non-financial  sectors as national  governments exhort  their electorates to think  domestically.

Banking capacity to   the real economy  has been reducing  and becoming more  expensive. At the margins,  real-economy employers  risk being classed as  bank-like entities.  The benefit, hard   as it may be at times to  identify, has been that  post-crisis regulation  has a strong bias towards  standardisation and  an extension of the  post-World War II  globalisation that has  been enhanced by the  creation of the EU   and the fall of the   Iron Curtain.  { IN DEPTH }  The end of globalisation?  IK O  N  IM  A G  ES  of moving goods and  services across borders.   Divergent regulation  in the real economy may  result in the production  of different goods for  different countries.  Manufacturers and  service providers will  be faced with the same  conundrum as financial  service providers: whether  to withdraw to the most  populous markets or  fragment their product  range to meet each  market s demands.  For example, Japan  Inc has been vocal in  expressing its concerns  about where all this  change could lead and   in September issued a   15-page report setting  out its Brexit demands.  The UK is not only a  significant market for  Japan, but also a base for  Japanese manufacturers  to export into the rest of  the EU (a larger market).  Any loss of existing  free-trade arrangements  is a key factor in their  business models.  The message from  the real economy to  regulators should be  to hold the line on  globalisation or risk that  their economies suffer  the higher cost of local  production for local  markets, and increased  layers of duties.

Real economy woes:   not  too big to fail   The collapse of Hanjin Shipping  has left cargos blocked at docks  and on the high seas. A passing  comment in a Daily Telegraph  article (www.telegraph.co.uk/  business/2016/09/18/fees- rocket-for-collapsed-cargo- giant-hanjins-clients) highlights  the risk to the real economy  when debt overwhelms a  business that ships goods to  hungry Western consumers,  in a world in which scale has  been associated with efficiency.  Estimates are that 400,000  containers with goods (some  of which are perishable),  belonging to 8,300 owners  were stranded on ships at  docks, sitting outside ports  and on the open sea. The  financial services  sting in the  tail  for importers is whether  their insurance is sufficiently  comprehensive to recover   the costs of late deliveries   or indeed of getting their   goods landed.  { WATCH THIS SPACE }  Professional standards One of the consequences of the  global financial crisis has been   the recognition that it is necessary  to address the behaviours of the  people working in the markets and  that regulation alone is not sufficient.  This has led to the issue of a  number of professional standards   { INTERNATIONAL }  TRADE AGREEMENTS   FOR BLUFFERS   The practicalities of how one separates a country  from a  club  that has formulated its regulation    for 40 years is only now being discussed and it is  important for treasurers to grasp the nature of the  problem that will impact the real economy that   they finance.  Currently, the UK is a member of the EU, which is a  tariff-free area within which goods and services move  across borders without duties. Goods entering the EU  are considered imports only at their initial point of  entry. Clearly something needs to be put in place to  ensure continuity of access to markets following the  conclusion of the two-year Article 50 period in 2019.  Two principle types of possible trade agreement are: 1) World Trade Organization (WTO) treaties. The   160+ members of the WTO have schedules of agreed  duties on goods and services, which take effect where  they do not have bilateral agreements: known as Free  Trade Agreements (FTAs).  2) FTAs are agreed bilaterally. Hugely detailed,  traditionally, these take many years to negotiate  (and often almost as long again to implement). Any  favourable tariff arrangements must be established via  an FTA as the WTO legislates against any preferential  treatment of trading partners through its most- favoured-nation concept.  In theory, it may appear to be  easy  to adopt WTO  treaties, but: a) the UK does not currently have its  own schedules   it operates under the auspices of the  EU schedules.

Neither the EU 27 nor the UK have laid down any  negotiating points yet, but reliance on WTO would  mean that as a  blue sky thinking  example, the UK  could not offer to allow EU food to come in duty-free,  to meet its 40% domestic shortfall in food, in return  for duty-free exports of financial services, without  doing so for all WTO members.  So what about an FTA with the EU? History shows  these can become marathon negotiations spanning  years as each party pushes to optimise the result   for themselves. And within the EU there will be   27 parties doing so.  and guidelines to which bankers are expected to adhere,  in particular the Senior Managers Regime.

I was invited to be a part of the set-up of London  Mid-Tier Treasury at PwC; I didn t know much  about treasury, but I saw it as a great opportunity. What do you like about treasury? Treasury is very central and very critical to   a business, and touches upon a vast range    of areas. You can be looking at cash  management structures one day, then the next  be covering pension risk or how Brexit or  The  Donald  may impact business in the future.   I really enjoy the broadness of the role and   the value your insight can bring. What s the best thing about being a treasurer? Being able to really drive change and generate  value for a business. What s the best thing about being a member  of the ACT? The support network. Which ACT qualifications do you hold? For  example, AMCT/MCT/CertITM AMCT How has your qualification benefited you in  your career so far? It has helped ground my understanding of  treasury and is something I can refer back to,   no matter what role I am in.  What would be your best piece of advice   to someone else considering a career   in treasury?  To speak to people both inside and outside of  treasury, people who know you both personally  and professionally and, where possible, arrange  shadowing opportunities to allow you to make  an informed decision.  What s your ultimate career goal?  To inspire and lead a large team. If you weren t a corporate treasurer, what  would you be and why?  It would likely incorporate some form of design  and running my own business.  If you would like to star in our 60-second  interview slot, email editor@treasurers.org.

Students of economic   history will know that the  Great Depression was a two-   or three-stage catastrophe.  The first phase began with   the Wall Street crash of   1929. However, the Great  Depression itself was more the  result of a subsequent banking  crisis. This began in Europe  with the collapse of Austria s  biggest bank, Creditanstalt,   in 1931. The shock waves from  this implosion spread across  the world, resulting in a  cascade of interlinked banking  runs and insolvencies that  ended up overwhelming the  global economy.  Looking at the travails   of Deutsche Bank today, the  parallels are all too obvious.  The first phase of the global  financial crisis began in the  US mortgage market, but then  spread to Europe, and now  seems to be snapping at the  heels of one of its systemically  most important banks.   Yet, despite the apparent  similarities, there are also key  differences. Deutsche is a huge  bank with around €2 trillion  of assets, but it is still easily  within the capacity of the  German government to bail it  out should things deteriorate  further. For political reasons,  German Chancellor Angela  Merkel has insisted there will  be no such intervention, but  in practice there are virtually   no circumstances in which  Deutsche would be allowed   to go bust.  Even so, the situation is  precarious. More worrying  still, it is symptomatic of wider  problems within European  banking as a whole. There are  essentially four big negatives  at work here: US misconduct  fines, zero interest rates,  tougher capital requirements  and the competitive challenge  of fintech.  Having already fined most  of the big US banks over  mortgage mis-selling, the   US Department of Justice has  turned its attention to Europe.  Typically, banks will settle  for a half or less of the sum  originally suggested. It seems  highly unlikely Deutsche Bank  would be forced to pay the full  $14bn regulators are gunning  for. Even so, the fines come  at a particularly vulnerable  moment for the European   banking system, already  struggling to cope with the  collapse in returns brought  about by the low interest  rate environment. Worse, for  some European banks, this is  not where it ends. A number,  including Deutsche Bank,  face further fines for alleged  Russian sanctions busting.  Rightly or wrongly,  European bankers believe   they are being unfairly  penalised. For instance, if  JPMorgan were to be fined   a similar proportion of its  market capitalisation as  Deutsche Bank, the sum  would amount to a jaw- dropping $200bn. The fines  are punishment, some believe,  for the action taking by the  European Commission against  Apple for tax avoidance. A  similar criticism is levelled   at so-called  Basel IV  capital  requirements, which seek to  place an absolute floor on the  amount of capital banks must  hold regardless of the riskiness  of the loan book.  Analysts have crunched  the numbers and concluded   that many European banks  are severely undercapitalised.  It may make sense to impose  the new standards for safety  reasons, but again, they hit  European banks harder than  US counterparts. What s  more, it has become virtually  impossible to raise new capital  in circumstances where it  is seen to be immediately  snaffled by US regulators.  Zero interest rates have  further steepened the  challenge, undermining  margins and, therefore,  traditional business models.   It may be possible to charge  big corporates for deposits,  but it is almost impossible   to do it to individual citizens.  To cap it all comes the  competitive threat of fintech.  Big banks are used to having  it all their own way, but now  there is a growing wave of  entrepreneurial endeavour  promising to eat their lunch,  such as Peter Thiel s N26   in Germany, a mobile   banking app.  History may not be about  to repeat itself exactly, but  eight years after the start of  the financial crisis, Europe s  incumbents remain firmly  stuck in a life or death struggle  for survival.   Do the current travails in the global economy mirror the circumstances   that precipitated the Great Depression, or is it a question of degree?

If targeted  public investments can generate positive  real returns, they ought to be undertaken.  In the US and Europe this could help   to offset the current weakness in private  investment growth. Modestly higher  government debt does not pose a serious  risk in most cases. Governments that  borrow in their own currencies, issued by  their own central banks, need not worry  much about rising borrowing costs from  temporarily higher deficits.   Governments have been slow to  develop policies and programmes    that deal with the undesired effects of  globalisation on the living standards of  low-skilled workers. Real income growth  for the top 10% of earners in Organisation   Are ultra-low interest rates in the  developed world here to stay? Not  necessarily. The slow-growth, low-  inflation environment is in some part a  natural economic phenomenon. Western  populations are getting older; their citizens  demand less credit and more savings   than before; and lower interest rates are  required to balance money markets.   In addition, as developed economies  become ever more sophisticated and  advanced, the degree of incline on the hill  of discovery gets ever steeper. However,  growth is still more sluggish than it ought  to be, and this is self-inflicted.   Economic growth will remain in a low  gear until the leaders of the developed  world take a more balanced approach to  economic policy. After the 2008 Lehman  mega-recession, central banks have been  relied upon to stabilise financial markets,  boost demand and prevent deflation all at  once. Monetary policy can have powerful  effects as it did in the years immediately  after the crisis. But when economies face  structural problems, monetary policy can  only buy time.   Central banks have indeed bought  time, as they continue to, by delving  ever deeper into their policy arsenals,  inventing new weapons when old ones  run out, and doing what was once  unthinkable, setting negative interest  rates in some cases. Alas, the vigorous  growth of the past has proved elusive.  All the while their strained efforts have  created risks and concerns of their own.   Monetary policy can provide an  economy with extra fuel. But it cannot  increase the size of its engine. Economic  growth in the developed world will only  experience a material and sustained  acceleration if monetary policy is  complemented with appropriate   fiscal and supply-side policies.  for Economic Co-operation and  Development countries since the mid- 1980s to the late 2000s was 1.9% per year  compared with 1.3% for the bottom 10%.  Income tax cuts that raise the disposable  income of low earners would likely raise  demand and growth, and would reduce  the attraction of populists, too.  Whereas fiscal policy can generate  demand quickly, gains from supply-side  reform are slow to take effect, but they  have greater benefits in the long term. For  the most part, supply-side reforms involve  scaling back bad government policies of  the past, often involving freeing up labour  markets that have become sclerotic from  excess regulation   think France. Both the  UK under Thatcher and Germany under  Schroder serve as examples of successful  labour market reform. More recent  examples include the likes of Ireland and  Spain, which currently enjoy some of the  fastest growth rates in the eurozone.  Governments in the developed world  have taken their eye off the ball as central  banks have made extraordinary efforts to  support their economies. Labour market  reforms can be politically unpopular.   But sometimes the medicine is bitter.   It is high time governments showed more  courage in reforming their economies.  Where there is fiscal headroom, it should  be used as a temporary sweetener. With a  more balanced policy approach, the world  could begin to look a little more familiar.  If not, the slower growth will become  entrenched, and ultra-low rates will  become permanent.   Central banks have played a reforming economic role.

Follow him  on Twitter   @ColinTyl  SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K   www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer November 2016 The Treasurer  17  This is my last article   for The Treasurer as the  ACT s chief executive. I m   stepping down at Christmas  after five years in the role.   It s been both a pleasure and   a privilege. When I took the   job, I often wondered what it  took to be a successful chief  executive. I still do.   As I prepare to leave,   I thought I d share with   you some of the lessons I ve  learnt in my time both as the  ACT s CEO and more widely  throughout my career. We  have come to refer to these as  my continuing professional  development (CPD) tips, but  very shortly they will merely  become nostalgic ramblings.  My predecessor left me  plenty of tips. Indeed, they  all came with a PG rating.  He encouraged us all at the  ACT to experiment and I am  thrilled that during my tenure  we have. I encourage my  successor to do the same.   Like all professional  bodies, the core route to  success is to remain relevant  to our members and wider  stakeholders. After nearly  30 years as a member, it is  crystal clear to me that the  ACT still has a strong and  continuing reason to exist.  We continue to need fair and  effective financial markets,  where the natural risks that  arise in international trade  can be dealt with. Markets  need to be made and trusted  by all who bring their wares.  For too long the unprepared,  untrained, misinformed or the  misled suffered misfortune.  Fortunately, since inception,   the ACT has been preparing  its members and their real  economy businesses with  means to help build trade.  I m delighted that we still  have many members who were  founders of the ACT back in  1979. Back then, why did the  ACT form? Finance directors  of the FTSE 30 (a phrase not  often used these days) helped  identify and then encourage  the emerging treasury  community to create an  advanced body of knowledge  about corporate treasury     in essence advanced finance  problem-solving.   I ve always wondered  why, at the time, the UK  finance directors didn t try to  convince their then respective  accounting professional  bodies to develop these skills,  given that they are such a  prerequisite for business     as much then as they are now.  In the next decade or so, I  anticipate that accounting and  financial reporting jobs will   become progressively deskilled  as cheaper rules-based  automated finance practices  become the norm. Increasingly,  the accounting profession  is encouraging its members  and students to upskill and  move towards higher strategic  ground. Perhaps one day there  will be an Institute of Advanced  Financial Problem Solving.   If there is, you can be sure  that the ACT and its members  will be at its core. After all, it s  what we already do.  When I joined the ACT   in 1988, it was to access a   body of knowledge that could  help me one day become a  corporate treasurer. It worked  and it s been fun. As I finish  my financial career, sitting in  the City of London, my baker s  dozen of CPD tips are: •  Accept that you don t have   all of the answers, but act,  always, with confidence;  •  Try to spot an answer   when you see one and give   { LEADERSHIP }  COMMENT  COLIN TYLER When all s said and done, addressing today s challenges   comes down to advanced financial problem-solving,   and treasurers are well equipped for that  credit to the author; • Be bold; •  Demonstrate and stick    to your core principles; •  Be consistent, even if    it s painful; •  Pick well (both people    and problems); •  Take risks with people, and   encourage your team to do  the same;  •  Make sure everyone has their  moment in the sunshine;   •  Give your team space to  grow… and they will;  •  Listen actively, but learn  when to ignore advice;  • Accept all offers of help; •  Be humble and remember it   is a privilege to have the best  job; and  •  Remember to pass the  baton before the end of the   exchange zone .  Thank you for all your  support and continuing  support of the ACT.   If there was  an Institute  of Advanced  Financial  Problem  Solving, the  ACT and its  members  would be at   its core    18  The Treasurer November 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  TRUMP  WHO S BUYING?  A Trump win in the US elections is unthinkable   from many perspectives, but that should not prevent   a clear-headed look at the economic ramifications.    Roland Hinterkoerner explores the issue    www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer November 2016 The Treasurer  19  COMMENT  What if Donald Trump managed to  prove the pollsters wrong and won  this unprecedented race for the US   presidency? While this has been an out- of-the-money option since the primaries,  and despite scandal after scandal haunting  his campaign, the man cannot be counted  out easily. That gruelling thought is  growing on more and more people, and  some of the pundits have run through  their strategy framework of how markets  might be affected.   But are markets really prepared for  what s to potentially come in the first  place? I doubt it. There are a few public  voices, such as fund manager Jeff  Gundlach, the man who dethroned   Bill Gross as the world s bond king. He   is pretty convinced that Trump will make  it, and his view is that this would not   be a bad thing at all. On the contrary, he  thinks a President Trump would be good  for the US economy, at least initially.   Gundlach may not be wrong. Donald  Trump s lingo on the economy doesn t only  include the obvious scare about future  trade policies. It has touched on a number  of viable points, such as lowering taxes for  businesses, spending on infrastructure  and cutting red tape. If done sensibly, this  part of his policy cocktail could have an  at least short- to medium-term positive  effect on the economy, the unemployment  rate and inflation.   Markets haven t thought much beyond  what kind of trade wars with the likes  of Mexico, China and Japan he might  instigate. But they should. While the holy  grail in economic forecasting appears to  be a Hillary Clinton win and more of the  same economically, they would do better  to think again. Clinton would have to cater  to the millions of Bernie Sanders disciples  and adopt lots of ideas he was advocating  during the campaign. Taxes would have to  be hiked, and red tape would be on the rise.   Let s think through what the Donald  could achieve, if done properly. Lowering  taxes significantly, as he proposes, would  surely provide a bit of a Reaganesque  renaissance and a respective boost,  much like we saw in the 1980s. America  needs to encourage existing and would- be entrepreneurs, as history has shown  sustainable job gains are predominantly  feasible in the area of SMEs.   Infrastructure spending would be key  to the quick successes that Trump would  depend on to get his feet on the ground  in the White House. It is desperately  needed across the nation, and if he doesn t  take the plunge, who will? The entire  world, maybe with the lone exception   of Germany, is on course of expanding  investment in infrastructure. Young Justin  Trudeau across the border could be a good  example of initiative in this field.   Benefits for the economy, labour  markets and even inflation should be fairly  imminent. The first question, however,  is one of the durability of such effects. A  massive boost in investment will not be  sustainable over the medium to long run,  and unless the entire economy catches on  to it, the positive effects may deflagrate  sooner rather than later. A subsequent  pullback from the final rearing up of  government and central bank stimulus  could be even harsher.   The second question will be one of how  to pay for all this spending. Coupled with  tax cuts, federal and state budgets would  come under enormous strain and deficits  would be poised to rise significantly.  Trusting that Trump was not serious   about restructuring America s liabilities  any time soon, the nation s debt would  soon surpass the 20 trillion mark and a  swathe of new Treasury bonds would be  issued to raise the funds.   The third question then is the structure  of this fundraising. Who would finance  what would amount to a humongous  spending bill of a Trump presidency in  the first place? Contrary to the concerns  some of the pundits may have, it should  not be a problem, as bond investors will  eventually not shy away from America s  ever-increasing debt mountain, but rather  see the logic in raising money for the  country s crumbling infrastructure.   Purchasing infrastructure Unless there was even another way…  Canada, for example, is choosing to  rely on its central bank to support new  government debt that is earmarked for  its infrastructure. Were the US to go  down the same path, it would constitute  a reopening of the Federal Reserve s  quantitative easing programme in some  shape or form. A central bank purchasing  infrastructure debt directly isn t exactly   a new concept, but it would certainly lead  to a widespread debate in the US.   If the undertaking were to be financed in  the public bond markets, the wave of new  supply would have to be digested and likely  leave a dent in the Treasury market, albeit  on a temporary basis only. So, in case of a  Trump win, it might be recommendable to  remain invested in the stock market, but  stay clear of bonds, particularly longer- dated treasuries. Ten-year yields could  potentially push up markedly beyond 2%  in the ensuing months.   However, post such a market correction,  investors should be ready to engage in   the Treasury market again. Not much   of a private sector follow-on in economic  demand is to be expected from an  infrastructure stimulus, and the world s  hunger for yield is structural and will  even surpass a Trump presidency. The  time when investors will hesitate to have  exposure to the Treasury market is quite   a long way off still.   An envisaged correction in bond prices  will make it even easier for investors to  buy more of them. As we should all be  aware by now, we live in an era when we  cannot rely on cyclical economic patterns  any longer, not even if those patterns were  being helped by extraordinary spending.  Rather, it is a structural shift driven by  demographics, lack of credit demand   and a disinflationary trend that we are  dealing with.   Against that background, not even  Donald Trump will be able to hold the  fortress for very long. He would try to  shape his legacy as a pragmatic doer right  from the start   but only to go down   in history as a tragic figure, as someone  who had interesting intentions and set  out to do right by his constituency, but  who ended up doing terrible things and  eventually bringing the whole house of  cards down.   He may denounce the debt mountain  his predecessors have built up, but end  up presiding over pushing it even higher  into more unsustainable levels. He may  genuinely want to protect American jobs,  but end up alienating the rest of the world  and starting trade wars that are to no  one s benefit. He may think acting as the  first isolationist US president in modern  times furthers America s cause, but end up  stirring up a new sort of multipolar world  that might have dangerous consequences.   In historian Niall Ferguson s words,  Trump represents a choice between  the status quo and change, or more  specifically SNAFU (situation normal all  fouled up) and FUBAR (fouled up beyond  all recognition).

From a young age, I wanted to  work with money; I wanted to work in a  bank,” he says.  It was less about wanting  to be a policeman or a fireman for me.”  Bruns took the swiftest route available,  leaving school for an apprenticeship  at Oldenburgische Landesbank in  Westerstede, Germany. He embarked   on a BA in European Finance and  Accounting, studied jointly in the UK  and Germany in 1991, and enrolled on an  MBA as a Fulbright Scholar at Kent State  University in the US in 1995, and came to  realise that he wanted to explore finance  from the corporate side.  Bruns joined General Motors  Opel,   in Rüsselsheim, as a financial analyst and  then became team leader in treasury. After  three years, he moved to Elexis, a specialist  machining company where he was head of  finance and investor relations. Two years  later, he moved to a Munich subsidiary  where he was general finance manager. It  proved to be a testing environment, with  orders falling sharply post September 11.   It was very tough,” he says.  We didn t  know if the company would make it. One  of my first jobs was to lay off 15% of the  workforce, which was one of the toughest  days in my career. Money was short and  every week I had to call the vendors to  negotiate how much we could pay.”  The company returned to profit, but by  2005, Bruns wanted to bring to an end his   weekly commute to and from his home  in Frankfurt. He joined Merck as head of  cash and risk management, and became  group treasurer in 2008.  It was the beginning of a period of  significant change for the company.  Merck s treasury employed only eight  individuals at the time. Today, it stands  at 40 and encompasses insurance  management and pension asset  management for the group, as well as  acquisition financing. Merck s growth  story was just about to begin. Treasury  and Bruns would play a pivotal role.  Family involvement Merck s structure is unusual in that it  is public and private at the same time.  Thirty per cent of the shares are held by  the public, while the Merck family retains  a 70% holding. This gives it a considerable  personal stake and liability, but affords  the company a certain flexibility. While  quarterly results are important for investor  relations, the family is also committed  to handing its heritage on to the next  generation. Furthermore, the family is  personally liable, which also applies to   the board of external managers.   With the family there, you can be  very fast moving. They are not actively  steering the company   that is done by the  board, but they are involved in strategic  decision-making. If you need some sort  of permission, this can be reached within  hours, if need be.”  With nearly 350 years of heritage,  Merck is a business of long-stayers. Very   few trainees leave the company, which has  also grown significantly by acquisition.   We have bought businesses for more  than €30bn and sold businesses for more  than €8bn. So there has been a change in  culture over the past 10 years.”  Most of Merck s acquisitions have  been US and Asian businesses, and have  cumulatively made the company more  internationally focused.  We deal with   66 countries on a day-to-day basis. We try  to make the workforce international and  diverse,” says Bruns.  The starting transaction was the 2006  deal to buy Swiss biotech company  Serono, a €10bn, biotech-pharma link  that was very important strategically. The  2010 purchase of Millipore for $7.2bn in  particular expanded Merck s life sciences  interests, and the $2.6bn acquisition of  AZ Electronic Materials, listed in the UK,  but with main businesses across Asia, also  broadened Merck s footprint.   The completion of Merck s purchase  of Sigma-Aldrich last year was significant  for group treasury. In contrast to the  Serono deal, where the family diluted its  shareholding slightly in the interests of  raising public funds, the Sigma-Aldrich  acquisition, all $17bn of it, was cash and  debt financed. The role that Merck s  treasury team played bringing the  transaction about and managing its banks  brought accolades, including European  Treasury Team of the Year in The Treasurer s  Deals of the Year Awards last year.  The acquisition financing was at   the time the largest in Europe since the    A JOB   WELL  DONE     www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer November 2016 The Treasurer  21  Making the operation   more efficient, negotiating  successive rounds of  acquisition funding and  seeing people grow in  their profession bring  Rando Bruns, head of  group treasury at Merck,  considerable satisfaction  Words: Liz Loxton / Photography: Louise Haywood-Schiefer    22  The Treasurer November 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  RANDO S TOP TIPS   FOR SUCCESS  1   Think about what you can bring to the table to move the  company forward as well as to improve the life of your colleagues  in different functions of the organisation. Have a holistic view of   the company and do not be only treasury-focused.” 2   You do not learn treasury at university; it s learning by doing. The  professional qualifications, like those from the ACT, help, but they   are mostly for people who are already in the profession. I have  made very good experience with our own specialised two-year   treasury trainee programme as a starting point.”  3   What I like about the ACT is that it has built a platform for  networking and communication. It s more international than any  other treasury organisation, so for me it s an opportunity to meet  treasurers and peers from the UK and other countries. Networking   is very important in today s world.” 4   For me personally, the secret to career success is that I am in  a profession that truly matches my personal interests. I enjoy   building a team with which high goals can be achieved. It is also  a pleasure for me to develop, challenge and assist colleagues in   their professional growth.”   What I like about the ACT is that it has built   a platform for networking and communication” in line. The feedback he received was that,  although this approach had been difficult  to swallow at the beginning, it had been  easy for bankers to sell internally, because  Merck was transparent and as good as its  word on outcomes.  We want banks that  want a long-term relationship and while  you are tough on pricing, you have to be  fair, so this worked really well,” he says.  The FX management of the transaction  is also an area he is proud of. Being  involved in the strategic discussions,  Bruns understood that Merck would  soon be in the market for an acquisition  using dollars rather than euros, so two  years prior to the Sigma deal, he began  discussions on setting up a funding  vehicle that reported in US dollars. Merck  established an in-house bank in the US  to accumulate currency, increasing equity  and converting euros into dollars.   That was the first step. If the  acquisition hadn t happened, that  wouldn t matter; we just had US dollar  cash in a US dollar entity, which we could  live with for a certain period of time.”  At that time the US dollar was well  above $1.30 to the euro and Bruns  view   financial crisis. A $15.6bn dual-currency  loan facility was secured in September  2014 and was followed by a €1.5bn hybrid  bond in December 2014 and a $4bn US  bond in March 2015.   The debt market plays a very important  role for us and, therefore, treasury  financing plays a very important role,”  explains Bruns. Treasury was involved in  strategic decisions at a very early stage,  leading discussions on the affordability of  the deal and the implications for ratings.  Banks and their role One of Bruns  ambitions for the financing  was to strengthen relationships with  Merck s 19 banks, but the direction he  decided on was a singular one. Rather  than allowing banks free rein to call   team members and pitch for a stake in  the Sigma-Aldrich transaction, Merck ran  the show from the off.  Every relationship  bank wants a piece of the cake and we  were very strict on this. We had a strategy  as to which bank we d have, which  position and what earnings, and there   was no room for discussion.”   Once the deal was public knowledge,  Bruns made it clear that banks ignoring  the  no calls  rule might end up on a  black list. In return, he offered fair and  transparent treatment. Every bank fell    was that the euro would weaken and the  dollar become stronger.  There was a point  when we had an agreement [to purchase  Sigma], which was friendly. We had an  agreement on price and on some other  aspects of the deal already. But we would  need to finalise on technical areas. And  at that point we could see the USD/EUR  exchange rate moving further down and we  said  we have to do something; we will lose   a lot of money if we don t .    We were hedging our remaining US  dollar exposure at that point. As we had  already considerable US dollar cash available  and already decided to do some US dollar  funding, we went out into the market and  bought plain vanilla USD/EUR options for  our remaining FX exposure of $10bn   and  we did so with the expectation we would   sign within the next few weeks, at which  point we would sell the option and go  straight into a forward.”  Merck did not take the cheapest option,  however.  We bought a one-year option  because we wanted to lose as little in option  time value as possible, to look for an efficient  way. So we spent €100m on option premiums.  This is quite some investment.

Three weeks  later, we sold it for €200m, so the strategy  paid off. Then we moved into the forward  and managed this towards the end.  Overall, we applied a hedging strategy  according to the deal probability   and  we did this very consciously. The overall  benefit was more than €2.1bn. Our average  hedging rate was above $1.30.” When  Merck completed the acquisition a year  later, the dollar had indeed strengthened  substantially; by then the rate was close  to $1.10.  Post-deal integration With considerable deal experience,   Merck has been able to hone its post- transaction approach. Bruns understands  the importance of grasping the nettle  early. Once the deal is signed, the  company begins negotiations with anti- trust lawyers on the scope of discussions  with the other company s treasury  function. Many companies begin the  integration process once the deal is   closed or shortly after.  We have a different  approach; we want to be done on the  day of closing,” says Bruns.  We sit with  the anti-trust lawyers of both parties in  order to prepare integration very early and  say: we will talk about treasury; we don t  talk about customers, products, prices,  vendors   nothing that would give us a  competitive advantage if the deal doesn t  go through.”   Bruns also believes in early discussions  with IT to ensure both parties connect  successfully on completion and early  involvement of the bank in order to be  ready for day one.  Cash pooling should  go live with closing. In order to achieve   this you need to set up bank accounts  for [businesses that are] not already in  your group. You maybe want to make  penny payments and start testing, which  is difficult for them and you typically get  rebuffed, two or three times, but I can tell  you it s feasible,” he says.  Looking ahead Facilitating Merck s growth has to  coexist with the day-to-day tasks, of  course   such as managing FX risk and  keeping a watchful eye on governance  issues. The team is also implementing a  completely wide-ranging new IT set-up for  treasury, triggered by Siemens, which is  withdrawing its cash management system  finavigate from the market.   Similarly, regulatory issues must be  faced up to   Section 365 regulation in  the US, the Money Laundering Act, the  Financial Transaction Tax.   Risk management and political risks  are more open questions. Merck hedged  against falls in sterling ahead of the Brexit  vote, but with most of its business outside  of the euro, the weaker pound and weaker  euro have been unproblematic. It s the  wider implications of the EU that will  exercise Merck.  Overall, we ve benefited  from the FX exposure. I think, as a  company, this might impact us in terms   of regulation. What will it mean when you  want to license a product, for instance?”  The outcome of the US election and  wider political risk are harder to call,  however.  It s another loose bullet,” he  says.  In risk management you discuss  what could be and what is the next   maybe . The big things, you don t see.  The shark that bites you comes from  underneath. We have a very bumpy and  volatile road ahead of us, I m sure of that.”  Team spirit In the meantime, the team s capabilities  and role in Merck s development bring  him a great deal of satisfaction.  Firstly,  enabling the growth of the company     to support this and to help the business  with efficient processes   that s where the  satisfaction lies. Secondly, the teamwork:   I think we re as good as we are because  we re a very good team. Each individual  in the team is there when they are needed  and goes beyond their tasks by going the  extra mile, as well as working jointly with  and for each other. We re a diverse team.  You need a completely different skill set  for all the different tasks   and that makes  us rich, I would say.”   VITAL STATISTICS 1668   year of foundation   50,000  employees worldwide  €12.8bn  revenues in 2015  66  number of countries in   which Merck operates  €1.7bn  R&D spend in 2015    Influencing and advocacy work has   been one of the ACT s priorities since   the founding of the professional body    in 1979. Throughout the decades, its aim has  remained the same: to ensure the voice of the   real economy  is heard in discussions around  financial policies and regulations.   One of the ACT s earliest successes was  persuading the government to establish a  sterling commercial paper market in the  1980s. In more recent years, it has been  active in influencing policy in a range  of areas, including base erosion and  profit shifting (BEPS), Basel III, the  European Market Infrastructure  Regulation (EMIR), the Fair and  Effective Markets Review, the  Wheatley Review of Libor,  money market fund (MMF)  regulation, payment  processes and the  proposed bank ring  fencing arrangements.   This level of  activity is only  possible because   the ACT s policy and technical team  constantly monitors the external  environment and the media to find out  which regulatory developments in the   UK and EU may impact on treasurers.  The task has become considerably more  challenging since a wave of regulation  swept over the financial services sector in  the wake of the financial crisis. As a result,  the ACT has often found itself confined to  a firefighting role.    Because of the pressure of regulation post  2008, we ve tended to be reactive,” explains  Stephen Baseby, associate policy and technical  director at the ACT.  Now we re trying to get  into the debate as soon as an issue arises.”  Taking Brexit as an example, he adds:  We  know politicians are working out what they  want to do. So we want to talk to them now.”  Pleasing most people most of the time As a membership organisation, the ACT   acts on behalf of its membership. So   it needs input and support from    its members if it is to succeed   in influencing any debate.   Of course, it s not always  appropriate for every treasurer    to comment on every topic.  While the impact of the    Basel III framework on bank  capital and liquidity ratios   may affect all treasuries  to some degree, a   consultation by the  UK Payment Systems   Regulator may only  be of interest to treasuries that handle  substantial numbers of payments and  receipts.  We have to be quite specific each  time as to who we are trying to influence  and which part of our membership we are  representing,” says Baseby.  Treasurers are very busy people who have  a lot on their plates, so why is it important  that they spend time trying to influence  policy?  No one else is going to think about  how regulation is going to affect treasurers   24  The Treasurer November 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  The torrent of regulation since the financial crisis has spurred  more treasurers on to become advocates for their profession.   Sally Percy finds out what they do and how they do it  SPHERE OF  INFLUENCE     www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer November 2016 The Treasurer  25   INSIGHT    REFLECTING TREASURERS  VIEWS The ACT consults its policy and technical committee  as to which regulatory areas should be a strategic  priority. This committee includes ACT members   as well as consultants, lawyers and tax specialists.  It also has a treasurers  forum, which is a group   of more than 100 treasurers from organisations of   different sizes, who have agreed to answer email  questions. The ACT may invite treasurers from this  group to go to private meetings with the Bank of  England or another regulator for discussions on   a particular subject.  When it is responding to a consultation, the   ACT will come up with a view based on the   opinions of its members who are affected by   a particular development. In its response, it will   look to demonstrate how a particular policy will  impact on the economy more broadly, not just   on large corporates.  from the point of view of treasurers,  particularly when the impact is indirect,”  observes John Grout, who served as the ACT s  policy and technical director between 2002  and 2015.   The case for a treasurer to get involved  in influencing is a strong one, argues  James Harvey, assistant treasurer at engine  manufacturer Rolls-Royce.  A huge amount  of financial regulation impacts corporate  treasuries. Most of it is well intentioned,  but it can have unintended   or intended    consequences. It is important that corporates  express their views as early as possible in the  development of the regulation so that they  can be considered before it s too late and  positions become ingrained.”  One regulatory development that  particularly galvanised the treasury  community was the adoption of EMIR in 2012.  In addition to new reporting and clearing  requirements, EMIR originally required  corporates, as well as financial services  companies, to post collateral  against their derivative  positions. Thanks to  lobbying by the ACT   and others, this  requirement was later  dropped for most non- financial corporates.   John Jackson, group  treasurer at utility  company Severn Trent,  helped the ACT with its  advocacy work on EMIR while  he was working for his previous  employer, engineering company  The Weir Group.  The Weir Group had very  sizeable FX requirements,” explains Jackson.   And the initial EMIR proposals would have  had a very significant impact on our ability  to enter into derivatives contracts. We would  have had to put a significant lump of cash  behind our derivatives, which would have had a  liquidity impact and could have led to sizeable  risk if there were significant market moves that  meant more cash being called. We managed to  get that requirement pushed back.”  Stronger together Since many regulatory  initiatives are global, a  UK voice, however loud,  is inevitably only one  of many voices being  heard or not heard. So  the ACT combats this  challenge by joining  forces with other  treasury associations.  For many years, it has  worked closely with the  European Association  of Corporate Treasurers  (EACT) to influence  European legislation  and it has a constructive  relationship with the  National Association   of Corporate Treasurers  (NACT) in the US.   The ACT also links  up with non-treasury professional   bodies and trade associations.  It worked with the Chartered   Institute of Taxation on  BEPS and it also liaises  with the Confederation of  British Industry on issues  of mutual concern. On  certain topics, it may find  some natural alignment   with financial services trade  organisations, which tend to   be well financed and influential.   Banks understand the importance   of lobbying and use their trade  associations at every opportunity,” says Sarah  Boyce, associate policy and technical director  at the ACT.  Harvey emphasises how treasurers can work  with peers from across Europe to present a  common corporate front to regulators.  We  work with the ACT, EACT and a number of  other large corporates from around Europe   to try and ensure that corporates have a voice,”  he explains.    This generally involves analysing the   text of developing pieces of regulation to   try and spot areas of concern, discussing   these issues to develop a common  understanding of the problem, responding  to consultation processes and raising our  concerns with the relevant parties. If you ve  got a large group of corporates from across  Europe saying the same thing, then your  arguments, statements and positions have   a lot more weight.”    No one else is going  to think about how  regulation is going   to affect treasurers    from the point of   view of treasurers”    26  The Treasurer November 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Treasurers can work with   peers from across Europe  to present a common  corporate front to regulators  The need for corporates to  put forward a united front is  particularly important in Europe.  This is because the EU tends to take  a consumer-oriented approach when  drawing up legislation.  You have to  turn everything round to their level of  thinking,” says Baseby.  You have to say,    Your consumers are paying this and   that. This is how we change that. ”    UK legislators, on the other hand,  are more inclined to take a broader  view of an issue and have more  sympathy for corporates.  While the ACT will remain a  member of the EACT, Brexit will  potentially weaken the ACT s  influence in Europe.  We will  be more able to influence UK   legislation and less able to make  ourselves heard on the world stage,”   says Baseby.  Advocacy across the pond In the US, the NACT has been active in  influencing policy and its chairman, Tom  Deas, has personally testified to Congress  several times. By connecting with other like- minded business advocacy organisations  through the Coalition for Derivatives End  Users, the NACT has scored two notable  victories with regard to the Dodd-Frank  Act. The first was getting corporate end  users exempted from having to post cash to  margin for the daily mark-to-market of their  derivative positions. The second was securing  an exemption from clearing requirements for  corporate swap end users  treasury centres.  The battle against excessive regulation  continues, however. Currently, the NACT  is opposing new actions by US banking  regulators that require banks to hold higher  capital for derivatives trades with end users.  Deas says the proposals  negate the benefits  of the exemption from margining, since they  have the same economic effect as if the end  user had to post margin and increase the cost  of doing the trade”.  Treasurers are also getting headaches from  additional regulations affecting US money  market mutual funds.  Particularly onerous   is the requirement  being implemented   that prime funds,  investing in non-  government securities,  post a daily variable net   asset value instead of a fixed  net asset value,” explains Deas.    This is causing treasurers major  problems because they have to   modify their treasury systems to  keep track of gains and losses on    each redemption for tax compliance.”   Definition of success While the ACT can boast many successes   in its advocacy work, it s not always allowed  to talk about them.  I can t tell you most of  the policy successes because they re things  we headed off, which didn t happen,” says  Grout.  But I can tell you that treasurers  would be much less happy.” He does, however,  cite the foundation of the UK commercial  paper market, the amends to the 1986  Financial Services Act, the introduction of  UK withholding tax rules for privately placed  bonds, work done during the financial crisis,  the Libor review and EMIR as examples of the  ACT s success.   Very rarely does the ACT set out to overturn  government policy on something because we  would never succeed in that,” he explains,  but  very often we nudged them away from things  that were really terrible and had to settle for  things that were simply unacceptable.”    We would probably say that the greatest  success has been the outcome, so far, of EMIR,”  says Baseby,  and the fact that we persisted  with arguments against dual-sided reporting,  which are beginning to have some effect.”  Another important win is how advocacy  work has helped to raise the profile of treasury  both within the regulatory and the business  communities.  The Bank of England will  phone us up and ask us about things,” says  Boyce.  We ve worked hard to make sure they  see us as a resource.”  Harvey confirms that regulation ranks  highly on Rolls-Royce s strategic agenda.   It s been discussed at board level,” he says.   It s definitely on the CFO s list of key things  we need to keep on top of.

You can also keep up to date by reading  The Treasurer and the EACT s monthly report on  regulatory issues, which is available on the ACT  website (www.treasurers.org/node/9894).  •  If you are invited to attend a private meeting with  regulators, make sure you know your facts and  understand how the proposed changes in legislation  will impact the economy more broadly (not just your  own business).  •  Join the ACT s treasurers  forum. •  Remember that a meeting with regulators can be an   opportunity for less senior members of the treasury  team to raise their profile and get experience of the  influencing process.  •  Maintain relationships with the key regulatory contacts  you make. They may be useful in future.  directly on behalf of treasurers. We very  much value the NACT s close working  relationship with the ACT.”  Future challenges Keeping on top of regulation is  an ongoing battle that won t be  made any easier by Brexit. As  Baseby points out, Brexit will  require the UK to rewrite  every trade agreement it has  with different countries,  with the result that new  import duties could  affect supplies of  raw materials and  increase the cost of  doing business.  He also predicts that there could be   a divergence of regulation  along interventionist,  protectionist lines   in  contrast to the convergence  of regulation that has  marked the past few  decades.  The risk is that  regulation could become  more of a distraction to  business and affect the real  economy,” he notes.  Boyce highlights that the  rise of protectionism in   Brexit will require the UK to rewrite  every trade agreement it has with  different countries, with the result  that new import duties could  increase the cost of doing business  Sally Percy is a  business and finance  journalist and   former editor of   The Treasurer  the US and China presents risks, along with  the global low interest rate economy and   volatility seen in both the commodities and  FX markets.

If treasurers are  concerned about   the threats posed  by the external   environment,  influencing work   presents them with a great opportunity to  make a difference. As Boyce puts it:  We re  all advocates now.”     28  The Treasurer November 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  The ACT s bursary programme extends  support and much-needed financial  backing to would-be treasurers in  developing countries, helping them to have  a sustainable impact on their companies  and environment, writes Lucy Gee   HOWTO SPEND IT  Just over 10 years ago,  the ACT Educational  Trust launched a   bursary scheme, providing  financial support to students  in developing countries,   who were not in a position   to fund their ACT studies.

BURSARY BENEFICIARIES  Chikondano Chisala,  senior treasury dealer,  NBS Bank, Malawi Chisala was one of the  first students to complete  CertTF under the bursary  scheme. Having achieved   a distinction, Chisala is now studying  towards the CertT qualification. She was  selected as one of the ACT s 2016  Ones to  Watch , a group of 16 treasury professionals  who we see as tomorrow s treasury leaders.    I joined NBS Bank as a management  trainee and first came across the treasury  world during one of my rotations,” she says.  Chisala applied for the ACT bursary  scheme to study CertTF with the hope   of gaining global expertise in treasury   and working towards ACT accreditation.    I found CertTF to be relevant to me as   a treasury professional working in a  developing country, particularly with  regard to understanding advanced risk- management tools to manage financial,  business and operational risks that are  very common in developing countries.   Studying with the ACT opened many  doors for me. I was promoted to senior  treasury dealer. Last year, I was the lead  representative from treasury on a project  team to upgrade core banking systems,  working on the swaps and forward  contract modules. I find the involvement  with international markets exciting.”  She continues:  The CertTF and CertT  courses are rich, well structured, practical  and they have equipped me with tools to  apply in my day-to-day operations as well  as provided me with a good foundation   to support my future career aspirations.”  Wisdom Akakpo, dealer,  Barclays Bank, Ghana Akakpo is one of two  students who have now  completed both CertTF  and CertT under the  scheme, achieving a   distinction for CertTF and impressively  completing all five CertT units in one  sitting. He is now planning to apply for a  bursary to study the DipTM qualification.   CertT deepened my understanding of  cash and liquidity management, corporate  finance and risk management markets,  among others. The course has helped   me improve in my liquidity and risk  management roles,” says Akakpo.  The  online Learning Academy was of great  use as I could interact with other students  and tutors, and seek clarifications on any  readings. The ACT team was very helpful  and available to clarify and resolve any  questions I had. I am humbled at the  team s dedication to see me succeed.”  One of his career objectives is to  become a well-equipped, world-class  global markets professional.  The ACT  qualifications are comprehensive and  internationally respected. The ACT  Charter will broaden my knowledge in  financial markets, sharpen my practical  finance skills, improve my marketability  globally, and prepare me as an agent of  change in Ghana. Via the ACT mentoring  service, I have access to a network of ACT  Charter holders for mentorship.”  He concludes:  Studying for CertTF and  CertT was a great experience. Personally,   I have never felt more equipped to  become a world-class corporate treasurer.”     Marcell Molnar, relationship manager, Deutsche Bank, HungaryMolnar was the winner of the 2015 Gay Pierpoint Award, in recognition of being the  highest-scoring CertTF student studying  under the bursary scheme. He went on   to study CertT, passing all five units in one  sitting with either a merit or a distinction.  He is currently studying towards DipTM  with the support of the bursary.  Molnar says he began studying  corporate treasury in an effort to better  understand his clients.  While the ACT  exams were challenging at times, the  study material is up to date and crystal  clear. As everything is available online,   it was really easy to access anything   I needed, including communicating with   a personal tutor, access to the student  forum and downloadable extra reading.   It was a real honour winning the Gay  Pierpoint Award, and actually took a few  days to sink in. I am grateful for the bursary  as it enabled me to complete these  fantastic courses. The bursary application  process was straightforward and I felt very  supported throughout my studies. Most  importantly, I was able to instantly apply  what I learnt in my daily role.”  Molnar s manager, Katalin Tornyai, head  of global network banking for Hungary   at Deutsche Bank, says:  Marcell s  commitment to his ACT studies and his  excellent exam results demonstrate his  client-centric attitude and self-initiative.

On the one hand, treasurers  need to be au fait with what is  required of them   such as KYC    and on the other to be aware,  or make their colleagues aware,  of the interaction between   real economy  business and  regulation.  Although not  necessarily financial, it comes  into play when processing  the financial parts of the  transaction because that is   the simpler bit to monitor,”  advises Baseby.  Treasurers should expect  their activities to be impacted  more in the future. This is  not only from the push for   The buzzword du jour   is  transparency , as  governments, regulators   and the public demand greater  insight into the workings of  multinationals after a series   of front-page scandals.   The unprecedented leak   of the Panama Papers earlier  this year put transparency     or rather the lack of it   in the  spotlight. The International  Consortium of Investigative  Journalists leaked more than  11.5 million financial and legal  records that exposed crime,  corruption and tax avoidance   within companies. A public  backlash ensued, and since  then transparency has stayed   at the top of the agenda.  Central registry Earlier this year, the UK was the  first G20 country to establish  a publicly accessible central  registry in a bid to shine a light  on companies. They now have  to keep a register of  people  with significant control ,  showing who really owns   and controls the company.   Transparency is becoming a  hot topic as sanctions, KYC and   moving tax rules [such   as the Organisation for  Economic Co-operation and  Development s base erosion   and profit shifting project   to reform international tax  rules] start to bite,” says  Stephen Baseby, associate  policy and technical director   at the ACT.  KYC is paramount for banks  to understand their customers,  but the requirements have  become so rigorous in recent  years that it is becoming  a barrier to trade, believes  the ACT.  The treasurer is     their responsibilities to  shareholders. This is  particularly pertinent at  publicly funded organisations,  such as housing association  Family Mosaic, which receives  funding from the Greater  London Authority and   central government.  Michael Verrier is non- executive director at Family  Mosaic, with decades of  treasury experience under his  belt, most recently at building  materials distributor Wolseley  plc, where he was group  treasurer until last year.  When  it comes to transparency in  treasury, I feel many companies  could do better. Reading  annual reports, there is a lot   of data required by accounting  standards, but [this does not  give a] clear picture,” he says.  Stakeholders primarily  want to know the company s  policies for FX management,  interest rate management,  funding strategy and capital  structure. Treasurers are  understandably nervous  about disclosing commercially  sensitive information, but  Verrier believes it is possible to  provide a clear picture of how a  company is managed by stating  a few well-defined policies and  operating parameters.     Stating these clearly and  applying these consistently  will increase stakeholder  confidence in the company,”  says Verrier.  For example, Family Mosaic  has historically had a higher  proportion of its debt at  floating rates instead of fixed  rates, making it an outlier  among its peers. But its annual  report is clear on the policy  and that the position is under  constant review.     www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer November 2016 The Treasurer  31  anti-avoidance of tax, but  also for a more equitable  allocation of tax revenues  to those countries that have  consumers.

Oxfam  works in more than 90  countries to help relieve  poverty in the worst- affected areas, from Darfur  to Syria, but it faces hurdles  sending money where it s most needed.  Sarah Love recently started in the new post  of head of global tax and treasury, which  came about as a result of a company  restructure. According to Love, the banking  sector has become increasingly risk-averse   in recent years, meaning that Oxfam has   to spend more time and effort dealing with  financial transactions in countries that are  deemed by banks to be  high risk . Banks  themselves face hefty regulatory fines if   they are found to have breached anti- money-laundering, anti-bribery and  corruption laws, even inadvertently.   Love says:  Banks are increasingly asking  questions and trying to understand exactly  where we work, what we re doing in these  countries and seeking to understand internal  controls we have in place to make sure money  doesn t end up in the hands of terrorists.”  Most recently, Oxfam hit a roadblock when  trying to donate money to Syria. One of its   intermediary banks in  Germany that had previously  transferred money to the  region changed its policy  overnight. It no longer wished  to facilitate any transactions  that involved sanctioned  countries. For three and a half  months, Oxfam could not get   any funds into war-torn Syria. Eventually,   the charity managed to find a new Belgian  intermediary bank, but Love is fully aware  that the same problem could repeat itself.   Meanwhile, charities that invest surplus  funds with investment managers are coming  under pressure to scrutinise exactly how the  monies are being invested, and ensure they  are paying the correct fees. Some charities  are paying for active managers to invest   the funds shrewdly, says Hanif Virji, partner  at AHV Associates, but they are instead  being funnelled into passive instruments   like closet tracker funds that simply track   a benchmark index like the FTSE 100. Active  management is more expensive than passive  management, meaning that some charities  are therefore paying over the odds. Virji   is currently compiling data to show which  funds are advertised and sold as actively  managed, but are actually doing no more  than tracking indices.  The new rules will  target co-mingled  funds, giving rise to   an increased tax  liability for corporates  Farah Khalique   is a freelance   business and   financial journalist  has an effect on companies   day-to-day cash management  activity, warns Tom Deas,  chairman of the National  Association of Corporate  Treasurers in the US. It is  currently standard practice   for a company to pool its excess  cash and lend it out to the  different companies within   the group structure. But the  new rules will target these   co-mingled funds, giving rise  to an increased tax liability   for corporates.  Deas says:  This has  treasurers very upset. The  [US] Treasury announced it  would not be able to use its  judgement to distinguish  between actions that were  abusive and those that were  in the ordinary course of  business. It would rather   apply these rules uniformly   to all transactions.”  A crackdown on  intercompany lending could  mean that companies have  to raise more capital via  alternative methods, such  as bank loans or the capital  markets, meaning cash piles  would be sitting idle instead   of being put to efficient use.  Shareholders vs   public interest Companies face a growing  dichotomy between the  increasing disclosure  requirements that need  to be managed and     Corporate financial management Investment  COMING OF AGE  The first Chinese fund  manager opened for  business in mid-2001.    But it wasn t until August 2004  that the money market fund  (MMF) industry took off with  the first set of guidelines from  the China Securities Regulatory  Commission (CSRC).1 After   a slow start, the number of  MMFs in China doubled  between December 2011 and  December 2013   and doubled  again by the end of 2015.  Between 2011 and 2015, MMF  assets under management  (AUM) skyrocketed 14-fold   to CNY 4.6 trillion ($704bn),  accounting for roughly 55%   of the Chinese mutual fund  industry s total AUM (see  figure 1, below). Globally,  renminbi MMFs now represent  13% of global MMF assets,2   up from just 0.5% in 2010.   The Chinese MMF industry  remains dominated by retail   CHINA S MONEY MARKET FUND INDUSTRY MAY HAVE BEEN SLOW OUT OF THE  STARTING BLOCKS, BUT IT S FAST GAINING GROUND   AND SCALE, SAYS AIDAN  SHEVLIN. THERE ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE INDUSTRY S RULES,  AIMING TO REDUCE RISK AND DELIVER GREATER LIQUIDITY FOR CORPORATE  CASH INVESTORS IN CHINA  investors, who typically focus on  a fund s yield, size and ease of  purchase when deciding which  funds to buy. The industry is  highly concentrated; the top  15 funds hold more than 60%  of AUM. Historically, given  limited distribution methods,  fund managers typically  focused on performance   as their key differentiator.   Over the years, a niche,  AAA-rated MMF industry   has developed to serve the  needs of more risk-averse  investors, including local  companies and multinationals  operating in China. While  these investors appreciate   the benefits of higher, market- driven yields, they do not   want to compromise liquidity  and security.  Evolution of China s MMFs  Preservation of capital and  liquidity has long been the   primary objective of MMFs.  With those goals in mind,  Western regulators, rating  agencies and the leading  trade association, the  Institutional Money Market  Funds Association, generally  consider five key criteria when  establishing MMF guidelines:  duration, credit ratings,  instrument type, concentration  and risk monitoring. These  relate to the key risks faced   by MMFs.   When the CSRC designed  the first renminbi MMF  guidelines back in 2004, it  modelled them on Western  guidelines. However, while the  CSRC s original guidelines did  reference the five key criteria  for MMFs, the restrictions  it imposed on the industry  were relatively loose and  interpretations of its guidelines  were similarly relaxed. In  short, fund managers typically   focused on yield at the expense  of liquidity and security.   More than a decade later,  in December 2015, the CSRC  unveiled new MMF guidelines  that market the most  significant rule changes   in the industry s history.   This latest iteration, which  represents the most important  and detailed change since the  publication of the original  guidelines, aims to make the  MMF industry more robust,  while minimising its exposure  to systemic risks. This goal   is especially critical at a time   of increasing credit and  liquidity risk.  Fund managers will have  much less freedom to interpret  this iteration of the CSRC   rules. Although we expect   a wider range of instruments  and issuers in MMFs, fund  managers are now more  responsible for assessing the  credit quality of issuers they  purchase and for protecting  their funds against adverse  market movements. For  investors, fund yields will  be lower, but fund volatility  will also decline. Meanwhile,  liquidity, credit quality and  disclosure will improve  significantly.

International rating  agency guidelines tighter  than those of the CSRC Although the new CSRC  guidelines more closely  resemble their Western  counterparts, there is still  a substantial gap between  the two standards. This gap  highlights the continued  benefits of using tighter rating  agency guidelines for investors  whose priorities are liquidity  and security.  The domestic AAA  MMF guidelines offered   years since the industry  was launched, MMFs have  become a very important asset  class, exposing investors to  the benefits of interest rate  liberalisation and market  pricing, helping to broaden  and deepen investment  markets, stimulating new  avenues of distribution  and reducing the market s  dependence on commercial  banks. The proliferation of  MMFs and the rapid growth  of AUM underline their  importance to both retail   and institutional investors.   For institutional-focused  funds with AAA ratings, the  impact of the new guidelines  will be negligible; that  is because rating agency  guidelines have significantly  tighter restrictions. For the  much larger retail MMF  sector, the new guidelines  will increase liquidity, while  reducing credit and interest  rate risk. They will also  improve disclosure standards  and encourage more proactive  credit control by the fund  manager. However, the rules  will also negatively affect fund  yields and the ability of fund  managers to outperform   their peers.   In sum, the latest iteration  of the CSRC MMF guidelines  delivers significant change.  The new guidelines encourage  a more robust investment  process and address the key  challenges facing China s  domestic MMF industry.   By any measure, that is no  small accomplishment.     www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer November 2016 The Treasurer  33  Aidan Shevlin is head   of Asia Pacific liquidity  fund management   at JPMorgan   Asset Management  by international rating  agencies in China are still  significantly tighter than the  CSRC guidelines, while also  taking account of the unique  characteristics of domestic  financial markets. These  include relatively opaque  monetary policy, unique  instruments, such as stock  exchange repo, and a more  limited range of issuers relative  to Western markets   all of  which can have a significant  impact on local market  liquidity and volatility.  Under Fitch Ratings, for  example, durations are shorter,  concentrations are tighter,   the range of approved  instruments is constrained   and credit quality limits are  quite a bit stricter. These  restrictions do limit the ability   of funds to outperform. But  they also address the key  challenges of credit risk and  liquidity risk that face Chinese  institutional investors.  Picking the right partner   is a top priority Because of the persistent  gap between the CSRC  guidelines and those of the  international rating agencies,  it is especially important for  corporate cash investors in  China with stricter investment  policies   prioritising liquidity  and security over yield   to  partner with the right liquidity  solutions provider. The most  effective partners have a deep  understanding of the markets  and will be able to react quickly  to market, regulatory and client  challenges impacting the short- term, fixed-income sector.   Conclusion: new horizons,  new opportunities The new CSRC guidelines  represent an important  milestone in what is still the  relatively brief history of  MMFs in China.

Following the signing of a Joint   Plan of Action (JPOA), a state of  commercial hopefulness surrounds   Iran. The immediate outcomes from   the lifting of economic and trade   sanctions have been: increased oil and gas  production and exports, trade deals, the  unfreezing of assets and, last, but not least,  reconnection to the worldwide interbank  financial telecommunications network.  Iran s oil and gas sector is the most  obvious beneficiary of the post-sanctions  era. The sector not only delivers around  two-thirds of the country s revenue, but  its restoration paves the way for foreign  direct investments. In a relatively short  period, the sector achieved pre-sanction  production levels of nearly four million  barrels a day and exports of two million  barrels a day, well above the expectations  at the time of the agreement, and a  development that has helped Iran   regain market share in Asia and Europe.   A wide range of foreign trade and direct  investment deals, including a handful  with US companies, were concluded  following the lifting of sanctions. Iran  also gained access to more than $100bn of  overseas frozen assets. Meanwhile, SWIFT  reconnected a number of Iranian banks,  including the Central Bank, to its network,  making financial transactions more  transparent and economical for the country.  In light of these developments, Iran s  central bank has said it expects GDP to   rise above 5% this year. The International  Monetary Fund similarly readjusted its  forecast to around 4-5.5%. Clearly, the  new era is expected to bring in significant  economic benefits. However, the  anticipated welfare is not much visible  as yet. Economic benefits do not tend  to spread evenly in state-led economies,  and international companies are still  proceeding with caution.   Corporate treasurers required to  operate in this environment will have  clear sight of the market potential, but  no straightforward answers to help them  navigate Iran s commercial landscape.  They will need to take a holistic view and  demonstrate significant patience if their  companies are to benefit while mitigating  downside risks.   A holistic view The JPOA has opened a new window. On the  one hand, traditional trading partners, such  as China, India, Russia and South Korea, are  deepening their relationships, leveraging  years of goodwill. On the other, new  partners, especially in Europe, are looking  to tap into Iran s economy, the second  largest in the region.

The US dollar market  is not accessible, but euro trade is, so  businesses require an appropriate channel,  depending on underlying base currency,  to manage payments and collections.  The global banking system, especially   in Europe, is unclear on how to manage  transactions allowed by the JPOA. Banks  prefer to be reactive and impose enhanced  due diligence for any corporate asking  about payments and collection. Added  to which corporate treasurers will need  to manage regular business risks, such as  credit, compliance, legal and political risks.   To operate effectively, corporate  treasurers must prepare well-defined  strategic plans. That should include  comprehensive compliance details as  well as risk and reputation assessments,  exhaustive corporate intelligence,  information on access to banking and FX,  risk management and business continuity  planning. Ongoing monitoring will also  be essential to help treasurers navigate the  evolving economic and political dynamics  in the new period in Iran.   Patience  Even given recent positive economic and  policy developments, the new period will  not necessarily be straightforward.   • There may be adverse reaction to  strengthening ties between Iran and   the rest of the world, perhaps even to   the extent of one of the JPOA parties  ceasing to perform its commitments  under the agreement.   • While the oil and gas sector has seen  immediate benefits, until more certainty  and trust is generated, foreign trade  and direct investment ties are likely to  develop more slowly with sectors such  as the automotive industry, airlines,  pharmaceuticals, retail and banking.   • Iran s ability to capitalise on the new  period also depends on its ability to  continue structural economic and   policy reforms. The latest efforts score  well in improving doing business in   Iran. However, the progress is gradual,  and might fall short of corporate  treasurers  expectations.  • While the financial sector s reconnection  to the international financial system   will help the sector to reduce transaction  costs and bring in up-to-date technology  and expertise, many international banks  remain ambivalent when it comes to  reconnecting with the Iranian banking  system. Progress is likely to be slow, with  limited options for straight-through  banking services onshore.   • International companies, especially  retailers, stand to benefit from Iran s  acknowledged market potential.  However, the expected harvest might  take longer as the welfare does not  uniformly and efficiently spread,  and long-outstanding local brand  associations do not break hurriedly.   Outlook The post-sanctions period presents  a powerful commercial and financial  proposition for international companies.  Some are already reaping rewards from  signing deals early. However, the road to  successfully unlocking those propositions  will be uncomfortable. A long-term view,  thorough analysis and a significant degree of  patience are essential for corporate treasurers  seeking to manage this balancing act.   www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer November 2016 The Treasurer  35  Semih Ozkan is an ACT student  (CertlTM) and a transaction  banking professional in an  international bank  SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K  This article first appeared in the Winter 2016  issue of Middle East Treasurer.    Financial risk management Manage risks  Whether or not they  predicted the outcome   of the UK s referendum    on EU membership, the  majority of corporates rightly  anticipated significant market  volatility post-vote. As such,  they may have sought to  mitigate financial risks ahead   of time.   Those that were able to,  ensured any funding deals  were completed before June.  Corporates also made sure that  they had appropriate currency  hedges in place   in advance   of the EU referendum result.  So while some companies may  have been surprised by the  outcome of the vote, not many  felt immediate impact from   FX movements.   Nevertheless, as sterling  continually depreciated  against the euro and US dollar  following 23 June 2016, FX risk  swiftly became a key agenda  item for corporate treasurers.  In fact, a survey conducted  among Lloyds Bank s   corporate clients over the  three-week period after the  referendum result saw 35%   of respondents cite FX market  levels as their top concern   (see figure 1, below).  FOR UK CORPORATES, FINANCIAL MARKET  VOLATILITY HAS BEEN ONE OF THE FEW   CONSTANTS BEFORE AND SINCE THE EU  REFERENDUM. WHILE SOME MAY HAVE BEEN  PREPARED FOR SHORT-TERM CURRENCY  MOVEMENTS, A NEW MARKET ENVIRONMENT MEANS  THAT TREASURERS MUST CAREFULLY RE-EVALUATE  THE MANAGEMENT OF LONGER-TERM FINANCIAL  RISKS, SAY YURI POLYAKOV AND ENRIC GIRONES  have even reduced the tenor  of their existing hedges, in line  with the parameters of their  treasury policy.   Other importers, whose  treasury policy allows a level  of flexibility around the choice  of hedging instruments, have  purchased more option-based  instruments, where previously  they had used forward-based  strategies. Meanwhile, a number  of exporters are also benefiting  from a flexible treasury policy  and have extended their  hedges in order to lock in  favourable rates for longer.   The road ahead But for those treasurers who  are yet to revisit the majority  of their hedges post EU  referendum, including those  who have little flexibility in  their treasury policy, deciding  what to do once current hedges  start rolling off is becoming  increasingly important.  Determining the appropriate  hedging instruments and  horizon for new hedges can   be complex, in particular given  the volatility in the FX market,  which is expected to persist as  the UK s negotiations to leave  the EU progress.  Longer-term hedging  decisions are made even  more challenging by the  uncertainty surrounding the  future business environment.  Some corporates are currently  in  wait and see  mode   still  wondering how the UK s  trade negotiations will unfold.  Whichever route is chosen,  it is likely that the rules of  engagement for UK businesses  trading with Europe will shift.  This may result in changes   36  The Treasurer November 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  FIGURE 1: KEY RISK ISSUES FOR CORPORATES  companies and supermarket  suppliers have been among  those sectors adversely affected.   Conversely, UK exporters  whose revenues are in euros   or dollars, and costs are in  sterling are benefiting from   the weak pound. In addition,   a weaker sterling tends to   make UK exports more  attractive to overseas buyers,  potentially leading to increased  revenues from both existing  and new customers.  This split impact has led  to contrasting financial risk  management strategies being  deployed in the wake of the EU  referendum. While importers  have seen the benefits of being  hedged through the period,  they are understandably  reluctant to lock in current  unfavourable rates and are  conservative about extending  their hedges. Some importers   No level playing field Several months on from the EU  referendum, these FX market  levels continue to move and  are proving challenging for  some UK corporates.

Consequently, UK corporates  with strong trading links to  Europe not only need to prepare  for operating in a new FX  environment, but a new business  environment, too. The challenge  is how to do that effectively with  such limited visibility of the  direction and progress of the  UK s trade negotiations.  Test your assumptions Stress testing the business  model can be a good place to  start. By conducting scenario  analysis, corporates should be  able to gauge what the future  business environment might  look like, and what is the  impact of exposures and risks  they may face.   In turn, this should enable  them to better determine  whether, and how, they need to  adjust their long-term business  strategy in order to survive or  thrive in the new environment.  After all, not every risk can  be mitigated by financial  instruments   fundamental  changes in the way the business  operates may also be necessary.  Such changes might include  rethinking investment plans if  certain markets become more,  or less, profitable.

Likewise, setting up  lines with banks, and putting  the appropriate derivatives  documentation in place, if a  company has not previously  entered into a master  agreement with their bank,  can limit the speed at which  changes can be made.  By starting to think about  their future hedging needs now,  corporate treasurers should find  themselves better equipped to  react more quickly to market  movements. What s more,  actively reassessing hedging  needs not only demonstrates  best practice, but also provides  an excellent opportunity for the  treasurer to make their voice  heard in the organisation and  showcase their value as a strategic  partner to the business.    evaluate the effectiveness of  their hedges by overlaying  these onto their exposures  when performing stress testing.  Time to act Firms can combine both  backward- and forward- looking measures when  designing their stress scenarios.  When examining the historical  behaviour of a risk factor, the  largest adverse and favourable  move over a certain horizon  (for example, 12 months) can  be identified (see red arrows in  figure 2). These relative moves  can then be applied to current  levels to build history-based  stress scenarios (see orange  paths in figure 2).   Alternatively, market-implied  volatility can be used to build  an interval around the future  value of a risk factor (see purple  paths in figure 2). These stress  scenarios can then be used by  corporates to better understand  the impact that adverse financial  markets may have on their net  asset values or earnings.  However, implementing  changes to financial risk  management strategies may  take longer than anticipated.  Building flexibility into a  treasury policy and getting   FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT:  A STRUCTURED APPROACH  The result of the EU referendum has clearly done   much to focus the minds of treasurers on financial risk  management. But regardless of the market environment,  treasurers may benefit from implementing the following  cycle when it comes to determining optimal strategies   for managing financial risk:   1.  Examine the business model and growth strategy,   and identify your current and future exposures/risks.  2.  Understand the impact that these exposures/risks   may have on your KPIs.   3.  Assess the effectiveness of your risk management  strategy in achieving your objectives (for example,  minimising KPI volatility).   4.  Frequently review and control the effectiveness of   your hedging strategy (product mix, tenor and  structure) to achieve your desired objectives.  solutions. These may include  switching suppliers, changing  raw materials or improving the  working capital cycle to benefit  from early-payment discounts.  Some may also look to begin  passing costs on to their  customer base, or absorb   the FX hit in their margins  where possible.   No matter which business  model changes are adopted,  it is important to ensure that  the company s hedges will  still be effective in this new  environment.

His supporters  argue that his strong business  acumen could give the US  economy a shot in the arm.   At this point, it looks like  a Trump win could bring  about a more obvious policy  shift. This could precipitate  short-term fluctuations in  US dollar markets. However,  these effects could fade as  soon as his policies prove to  be successful   or could grow  should the opposite transpire,  commentators suggest.  Trade While Clinton originally  referred to the Trans-Pacific  Partnership (TPP) as the  gold  standard” in trade agreements,  she came out in opposition   to it when negotiations  wrapped up. Traders are  likely to wait for clarity on her  position before making any  decisions here.  Under Trump s trade policy,  the North American Free Trade  Agreement and the TPP will be  revisited and higher tariffs may  be applied to Mexico and China,  with the goal of stimulating  domestic manufacturing,   according to commentators,  such as IG Index. If growth is  affected when trade ties are  cut, investors could cut their  exposure to US equities and   the dollar. Alternatively,  Trump s stance could see   the dollar rise as investors  liquidate their foreign (riskier  asset) holdings. Concerns   that Mexico s exports to the   US could be threatened have  seen the Mexican peso hover  near a historic low of 20 to the  dollar. However, the peso s ties  to the oil price and Mexico s  credit-rating woes could also   be contributing factors.   As the future of global  trade hangs in the balance,  International Monetary  Fund managing director  Christine Lagarde announced  a downgrade to the US growth  forecast and warned against  trade restrictions.   Tax Under Clinton s tax plan,  capital gains will be subject to  increased duties, there will be  a surtax on income over $5m  and corporate tax loopholes  will be closed. Analysts at IG  Index expect these stringent  measures to be reflected in   the Dow and other indices.  Trump s tax plans could   see revenues fall in the short  term. He envisions halving  corporate tax and reducing  income tax brackets from seven  to three, freeing 75 million  households from paying  tax and cutting the top-tier  maximum from 39.6% to 33%.  This could boost domestic  investment, lifting the dollar  and key indices.   Spending  According to the Committee  for a Responsible Federal  Budget s most recent report,1   Clinton s plans would increase  the debt by $200bn over   a decade above current law  levels (compared to our prior  estimate of $250bn), and  Trump s plans would increase  the debt by $5.3 trillion   (compared to our prior  estimate of $11.5 trillion).” It s     That said, the US dollar does  not always react in the same  way as other currencies. In  times of turbulence, this   safe-haven currency can  actually strengthen as investors  become concerned about the  impact on the global economy  as a whole.  On a corporate level,  increased dollar volatility could  pose varying challenges for  treasurers, depending on the  nature of their international  activities. Firms that export  to the US could see their  cash flows being hit by their  heightened FX exposure.4  This is a time for treasurers  to monitor the currency  markets carefully   especially  currency pairs like GBP/USD,  USD/JPY and EUR/USD     to facilitate well-versed  decisions around the best  timing for transfers.   Precious metals  Gold, like any safe-haven  asset, responds to ecopolitical  upheaval. Brexit saw gold rising   commodities. Metals were   up across the board, according  to Marketwatch.com.  Fed chair Janet Yellen noted  that a hike could come by  the end of the year, but for  now, the economy has  a little  more room to run”. The Fed  assembles again just a few  days shy of the election. Most  economists believe that rates  will stay put until after the  election   partially due to a   wait and see  approach, but  predominantly as a response  to sluggish global growth and  a focus on reaching maximum  employment targets.   While the Fed calls the shots  on monetary policy, decisions   made by the new president will  affect political and economic  stability, with a substantial  influence over the dollar.   Managing market volatility  From the point of view of  corporate treasurers and  financial executives, it s  essential to have robust  strategies in place alongside the  analytics and solutions needed  to give a clearer view on how  to manage FX and liquidity  risk more efficiently. This race  could still go either way; and  it s prudent for treasury to  prepare for all outcomes.   Forex Looking at the recent EU  referendum, the British pound  fell against the US dollar by  14% after the Leave vote    recording the sharpest two-  day dip by any major currency  since 1973. While it s difficult  to say whether the dollar could  plummet this low after the US  election, with either candidate  winning, the dollar is likely to  drop initially to some extent.  Amid uncertainty, investors  are likely to take flight from the  dollar in favour of more stable  global assets.   It s difficult to predict what will happen  as the race towards the Oval Office  continues to wag currency markets  by $60-80 per ounce before  levelling out in the $1,300s.  This price could fluctuate again  around the US election.  Uncertainty after a Trump  victory could lift the gold price;  whereas Clinton as president  could see gold prices losing  ground as the risk premium  falls (unless, of course, the  Republicans gain control of   the Senate).   Specific policy changes,  from either candidate, could  impact metals more broadly.  For instance, if the winning  government foregoes the TPP  and Transatlantic Trade and  Investment Partnership (TTIP),  the US could potentially  relinquish market share in the  precious metals scrap industry.   The way forward  It s difficult to predict what  will happen to markets across  the globe as the race towards  the Oval Office picks up speed  and continues to wag currency  markets. Corporate treasurers,  therefore, need to adopt a more  vigorous risk management  mindset when choosing  execution strategies and  processes, as well as analysing  which currency hedges to use.   It s important to understand  the underlying risks of FX rates  and how to measure them  before deciding on a hedging  strategy to reduce volatility.   It s also essential to analyse  market pricing to uncover  the most cost-effective hedge  structure, as well as stay abreast  of relative liquidity during   the day.  Hopefully, the US election  year may just cause a few  bumps in the road rather   than a complete change of  course for the US dollar and  world economy.     www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer November 2016 The Treasurer  39  important to note that this is a  rough and preliminary report.   The first Clinton-  Trump debate Forex traders decided Clinton  won the first debate. The  US dollar and Mexican  peso enjoyed a bump in the  aftermath, as gold prices  dipped and the safe-haven  yen weakened. According to  analysts, these moves suggest  that Clinton came out stronger  in the round.  From a market  perspective, rightly or wrongly,  there is an understanding   that Mrs Clinton would  be a safe pair of hands,”  Brad McMillan, CIO for  Commonwealth Financial   in Massachusetts explained.2  While US presidential  elections are not normally  major market movers, this  year s election shaped up as   a highly unusual contest with  substantial implications for  the economy and financial  markets, particularly FX.  History suggests that  markets respond better to  elections when the outcome  is predictable. Yet throughout  the debates, uncertainty was  the prevailing sentiment   and  we all know that markets hate  uncertainty, as evidenced by  the direct impact to US dollar  currency market sentiment   on both FX and gold markets.   A Trump victory could very  likely mean more alterations   in foreign policy and trade,   and presumably marked  changes in American politics.  This, in turn, could insulate   the US from its trading  partners and have an effect  on exports. It could also see  immediate, but short-term,  fluctuations in the US dollar  markets due to the uncertainty  about the effects of Trump s  policies on the US economy.3   Adding to this market  trepidation is the possibility  of a Federal Reserve interest- rate increase.

Since  infrastructure projects will  likely be supported by central  governments, a lack of country  knowledge and the complexity  involved in evaluating multiple  countries could prevent credit  analysts from assessing the   order to ensure the mechanism  is in place, a definite concept  that everyone agrees on is badly  needed. The concept should  not be too rigid, so as to allow  for flexibility in structuring  the new bonds, but it needs to  be sufficiently clear to prevent  exploitation of the additional  support mechanism.   In general, the Silk Road  bond concept should entail  the use of proceeds to fund  infrastructure projects along  the Belt and Road routes.   Silk Road projects will need  to be defined, and proposers  should also indicate the  anticipated benefits to Belt   and Road countries. In that  sense, a ratio of economic  benefits to the country where  the project is situated to  economic benefits to other   Belt and Road countries   could be a good indicator  of overall value. Dagong is a  member of a working group,  organised by the International  Capital Market Association,  working with many market  participants to establish a Silk  Road bond concept.  Multiple countries of risk Proposed Silk Road routes take  in many different territories  and, as a result, there are two  key credit considerations.  First, given the diverse   Silk Road bonds could   be an innovative capital  market solution with    the potential to benefit a vast  number of people in Belt and  Road countries, many of which  have been previously ignored  by the international bond  market. Their development  will help spur the economy   not only of China, but also  other countries along Belt   and Road routes, a win-win   for global trade and for poverty  reduction. At the same time,  there is a need for third-party  verification for this new asset  class and perhaps an external  support mechanism to ensure  investors can assess the risk  versus return trade-off.   Definite concept needed Silk Road bonds could offer  investors both portfolio  diversification into other Belt  and Road countries, and extra  yield in exchange for lower  liquidity and longer tenor.  However, first and foremost,  the concept needs to be  clarified by the investment  communities and governments  of the Belt and Road countries,  especially China. As yet, there  is no single concept for Silk  Road bonds.   In our view, Silk Road bonds  could come with an additional  support mechanism and, in   SILK ROAD BONDS COULD BECOME ANOTHER  KEY ASSET CLASS AS CHINA REACHES OUT TO  THE WEST UNDER THE ONE BELT, ONE ROAD   INITIATIVE. WARUT PROMBOON EXPLAINS  HOW THEY DIFFER FROM OTHER ASSET   CLASSES IN STRUCTURE AND RISK  LAYING   A PATH  SOURCE: HONG KONG TRADE DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL  SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K  level of external support  those projects might receive.  Another issue is how well  the investor community will  be able to gauge the level of  mutual support of countries  along the Belt and Road  routes. Simply speaking, a  failure to pay in one country  could affect subsequent  projects in other countries  along the routes, so the   Belt and Road routes      www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer November 2016 The Treasurer  43  Multiple regulatory  regimes Silk Road bonds can be listed  in multiple countries and  under different regulatory  regimes, especially multiple  Belt and Road countries.  Every Silk Road bond could  carry different disclosures,  accounting standards, laws  and languages. In addition,  investors may not have access  to some markets, which will  make some Silk Road bonds  less liquid.  Different accounting  standards mean foreign  companies could be  discouraged from issuing Silk  Road bonds in a country where  they need to convert their  accounting standards (as in the  case of Panda Silk Road bonds,  where issuers would need to  provide financial statements  according to Chinese  Accounting Standards).  Extra features We believe many Silk Road  bonds will come with extra  features, such as sustainability  (ie Green bonds) and/or   Sharia compliance (ie Sukuk  bonds). These features are  compatible and can overlap.  So there could be Green Silk  Road bonds, Sukuk Silk Road  bonds or even Green Sukuk  Silk Road bonds. The Chinese  government is committed to  the growth of the Green bond  market. Likewise, the new  Silk Road covers many Islamic  countries and we would not   be surprised to see Sukuk   Silk Road bonds marketed   to Islamic investors.  Certification We believe all of the above  unique features could  necessitate Silk Road bond   Secured bonds Potentially, Silk Road   bonds could be secured with  assets such as infrastructure  projects. To properly gauge   the credit risk of secured  bonds, credit analysts   will need to understand   the recovery rate of these  assets. The subsequent issue  would be whether a project  will be a brownfield or  greenfield project.  For a brownfield project  or a project in operations  that already generate cash  flow, investors may not have  a reliable default history,  recovery information or tested  bankruptcy procedures in  many of the Belt and Road  countries. For a greenfield  project, or a project either  under construction or a  project that has not started  construction at all, project  finance will require experts    to look into a project s  future cash flow. We believe  independent third parties   (ie credit rating agencies)  could come in to study  underlying assets so that  investors can properly assess  the recovery rate of the bonds.  External support  mechanism We believe one of the solutions  for difficulties in assessing  multiple countries of risk and  unfamiliar underlying assets  is a credit enhancement,  ie a guarantee or a wrap,  either from a government or  commercial banks (in the form  of standby letters of credit).  Long tenor Silk Road bonds  tenor could  be long, ie 10 years or more,  as Silk Road bond proceeds  could be used to fund long- term infrastructure projects.  A longer tenor makes external  support in terms of guarantees  by multilateral organisations  problematic, in our view.  existence of mutual support  will be critical.   Second, investors may lack  knowledge of some of the  countries along the routes   and, in fact, these countries are  likely to be the ones that most  need new infrastructure in  the first place. Many Belt and  Road countries are not very  well known to investors and  the majority of the Belt and  Road countries are classified  as high risk by the investment  community. Despite the  fact that only two out of 65  countries along the Belt and  Road routes are not rated  by any major international  rating agencies (Iran and  Turkmenistan), many countries  do not have a presence in the  international bond market.  The median and average GDP  per capita of Belt and Road  countries were $5,496 and  $10,402, respectively, according  to the latest information from  the World Bank, both low  compared with those of   many developed countries.   Warut Promboon is chief rating   officer at Dagong Global Credit   Rating Ltd in Hong Kong  certification by third parties.  In fact, third-party verification  may be needed from the outset  to certify whether Silk Road  bond proceeds are genuinely  to be used to fund Belt and  Road countries, and whether  a project is qualified as a Belt  and Road project.  Finally, investors will need  to be able to differentiate  credit quality among Silk  Road bonds. In general,  investors carry out credit  due diligence through credit  ratings and credit research.  The former relies on local and  international rating agencies,  while the latter relies on  in-house credit teams, asset  managers and/or sell-side  research houses. We believe  that we need sufficient rating  coverage for Silk Road bonds,  as dedicated in-house research  could take time to be built  up. However, we expect the   availability of research and  ratings on Silk Road bonds to  grow in tandem with the rising  demand and supply of Silk  Road bonds.  In conclusion, we believe  Silk Road bonds are here   to stay, but there are a  few loose ends that major  governments along the Belt  and Road routes, together   with the investment  community, must work on  together.

Nevertheless, who wouldn t  want to  push a button   with simplified, bespoke  and integrated solutions to  consolidate and standardise  processes and reporting? Yet  treasury remains a complex  discipline, unique to business  and sector, and making  decisions on when, where and  how to invest are not easy.  Creating a case   for investment The most important question  is: what will new technology  add to treasury s capability? As  a starting point, you will need a  solid and tangible business case  for investment. Most corporates  will face constant challenges  from within to deliver year-on- year cost savings and this can  only be achieved by looking   at new ways of doing things.  Once expected benefits  have been mapped to these  objectives, the risks in not  making the technology  investment can overshadow  financial cost savings. Making  suboptimal financing decisions  or not being able to provide  timely financial reports could  cost your organisation more  than the cost of the capital  investment in technology.  Think broader Technology-led transformation  needs excellent planning to  realise its potential.  Out of   the box  rarely works. Begin  with the end in mind, and   you are more likely to benefit  from broader business change.  Think broader again to reach  for more: how many steps  might your new technology  eliminate from your current  processes? How much more  quickly would that enable you  to deliver insight?   Treasury technology can  be complex, both for the  treasury function   who   are not IT experts   and for the  IT team, who are not treasurers.

Realistically, any investment  you make needs to be viewed  as the start of a rolling  programme. This positions your  treasury function to think as  a market innovator, or at least  as a fast follower, that is open  to keeping pace as products  and services evolve, from  cybersecurity to biometrics,  predictive analytics to robotics,  and even blockchain.   A technology-led change  project can also be a great  way to motivate your people.  Developing a shared vision of  a new technology and process  landscape, and then sharing  the highs and lows of delivering  it, can pull together a bonded,  agile new team.  A question of how   far to go Technology should encourage  the right balance of releasing  people from transactional work  while maintaining an optimised  control environment,  becoming more algo and  performing more value-adding  activities. How much of your  treasury waterfront can it cover,  and how agile is it to respond  to change? A well-thought- through approach and process  of continual improvement  could even remove the need for  a button to push   as it requires  someone to decide to press it.   Do nothing  is no longer a  viable option: not only will it  entail missing out on improved  efficiencies and lower costs,   but failing to consider emerging  technologies in your landscape  could mean losing competitive  advantage or   worse    unacceptable operational   and reputational risk for   the organisation.   improvement) and  soft  (better  reporting accuracy).   Traditionally, one of the  most common business case  problems in treasury has been  quantifying the hard benefits.  With treasury teams small in  number, the headcount savings  are rarely evident. So it is  critical to articulate clearly the  softer benefits   such as real- time reporting or more accurate  cash forecasting   and the  business value that they bring.  People make decisions  based on intangibles as well  as tangibles. Always include  qualitative benefits as a  potential deal clincher.  Flexibility and a   bi-modal approach The programme must be  flexible enough to be future- proof and a  bi-modal   approach will help link the  current landscape to the  desired end state. Mode 1  targets stability in getting the  most from existing core system  effectiveness. You are likely   to have an existing landscape  and ways of working.  Maximising this will appeal   to the budget holders.   Mode 2 focuses on agility  and ongoing investment in  development, innovation  and change. Using the latest  technology in innovative ways,  or being at the leading edge, is  unlikely to be a smooth process  because there is less experience  available to guide you. The  complexities of getting layered  products to work together with  your core system and be  right  first time  can be costly without  access to a combination that  has been developed, tried and  tested in practice elsewhere.  Implementation basics Strong project management  is the key driver of  implementation success  and can overcome budget  constraints, overburdened    staff, scarcity of resources  and tight timelines. Key  stakeholders need early  identification: who is currently  experiencing the  pain ; who  will provide input during the  project; who will benefit; who  needs to approve the project;  who will be accountable   during the implementation,  and so on. Accountability   instils responsibility.   Identifying core  implementation roles is also  essential, including those who  can identify and solve problems  as they arise; those who have  subject matter expertise; those  who possess the seniority to  allocate internal resources and  those who have the capability to  oversee the vendor relationship  and keep the project on track.   Requirements must be  prioritised and aligned to  the budget provided, and  the complexity of each must  be understood. Different  platforms and feeds may be in  scope, including market data,  trading, banking, various forms  of enterprise resource planning  (ERP) and middleware.  Whichever areas are targeted,  a clear critical path is needed,  and interdependencies must   be tracked.   Deeper ERP integration,  increasing automated  transaction posting and  reconciliations, insight and  intelligence analytics, mobile  and digital developments,  and even a shift to hosted  or outsourced support  could evolve within the  implementation timeframe, as  benefits are seen and realised.   Keep learning Finally, having taken the leap  of faith and invested in the  technology that you hope will  take your treasury function  forward, it is vital at each step  to analyse what is working,  what isn t and what you can  learn for next time. The pace of   How much of an edge will  these factors give you in terms  of performance, and how can  these be demonstrated as  providing value to the business  as a whole?  This is one of the best  outcomes of new technology  solutions: not only can they  help you do what you currently  do better, but they can also  enable you to expand in   new directions.   Cost of delaying In examining real costs and  whether there is an appetite to  invest, you also have to consider  whether you can afford not to  invest. The common challenge  for investment is to find ways  to reduce costs or save time.  Technology that delivers either    or both   of these will give  you an edge, which in turn  could lead to better judgement,  accuracy and certainty that  more than justifies your  investment. How  algo  can and  should your treasury function  become? You need to identify  the costs to your business of not  investing in new technology.

Hype around how  Facebook, Google and   others are using search and  self-learning algorithms  can make it seem as if every  algorithm is cutting edge.   It is not. An algorithm is   any specific method, process   or set of rules that can be  used to complete a clearly  defined task, which could   be processing data, solving    a problem or achieving a  goal. Self-learning algorithms  take things to another level  and The Treasurer recently  explored the implications for  the future of treasury roles  (see www.treasurers.org/ node/322545). See also the  ACT blog at https://blogs. treasurers.org/whats-on-  the-horizon-for-treasurers   The potential of  smart   self-learning algorithms is  massive. At Essex University,  Professor Maria Fasli is using   multiple, goal-oriented,  self-learning algorithms  called agents to analyse big  data on the behaviour of the  massive and complex FX  market: extracting patterns  of behaviour, formulating  hypotheses to explain them,  developing simulations to   test these and then refining  them to the point where they  can predict the behaviour of  the market.   Get smart  Traditional software  applications need to be told  explicitly what it is that they  need to accomplish and the  exact steps that they have to  perform. Agents need to be  told what the goal is, but not  how to achieve it,” says Fasli.  Being smart, they actively  seek ways to satisfy this goal,  reacting to changes in the  environment as they occur,  then modifying their course  of action to accomplish their  goal.  We will increasingly be  delegating tasks and goals to  such systems and interacting  with them,” she predicts.   Many of us now depend  on rule-based algorithms,  personally and professionally.   They are already in use in  cash pools, zero-balancing  pools, notional pools, cash  concentration and that  sort of thing,” says Sanjay  Bibekar, treasury technology  lead at PwC. With cash  concentration, for example,  software uses algorithms to  ensure that sub-accounts  have a constant/zero balance  and that debit and credit  balances are automatically  physically swept into the  concentration account (when  local regulation allows).   Banks and treasury  management system (TMS)  developers have been using  algorithms for years to  offer the cash management  functionality in their products  and services. There is nothing  new about software programs  that enable treasurers  to complete tasks more  efficiently and effectively   IF TREASURERS ARE TO MAKE THE MOST OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES,  IT S TIME TO DEMYSTIFY THE ALGORITHM.

For example,  analysing bank charges,  comparing them with the rate  card and determining whether  you are paying the least you  could for them; managing  credit and risk analysis of cash  and liquidity across multiple  cash investment strategies;  optimising the control,  timing, price and execution  of currency orders. FX is an  area where banks are already  helping corporates to explore  the benefits.  Think big For example, a large corporate  can control the execution  and risk of a strategy to  buy currency for one large  (and material) transaction,  with the help of rule-based  algorithms. By using bank  infrastructure that enables it  to: split its currency purchase  into small trades; define the  start and end time for the  strategy and the conditions  affecting this; limit the  maximum strategy price by  setting the frequency and  timing of trades; setting the  maximum spread to limit the  impact of currency volatility  and wide spreads on the  corporate s average rate.  Developing the complex  algorithms to achieve this   is a massive undertaking    about the skills and software  that would be needed to  make them a reality. Then  there are issues such as the  need for back testing, manual  oversight and security. The  biggest impediment to rapid   Excel into Outlook, where he  has set up a maturity ladder.   Like all treasurers, Fell is  focused on risk and is keen  to highlight the potential  strengths of an off-the-shelf  TMS.  I tend to work in  sectors where transaction  values are high and volumes  are low, such as real estate  and mining. A TMS is more  effective when there are  many more deals or you are  operating an in-house bank,”  he says. Lack of control may  also be an issue.  If somebody  makes a mistake, they can  make it look as if they didn t,  by editing the spreadsheet.  With a TMS, data is more  secure and you have an   audit trail.”  It may be a mistake to  allow your aspirations or  achievements to be limited  by the overblown hype that  surrounds self-learning  algorithms, or to become  distracted by differences of  opinion and interpretation  around the associated  language.

Most of the time we use them  without thinking about this;  particularly when we are not  alerted to their presence by  the names of products and  services and practices, such   as algorithmic trading.  Look beyond the hype As algorithms have become  part of popular culture and  everyday language, it can  seem as if they have also  been endowed with near- mythical powers, but the  widespread focus on cutting- edge applications can be  misleading. Computer-based  trading strategies (such as  high-frequency trading),  which are supported by  algorithms, may grab the  headlines; nonetheless,  numerous treasurers are   using algorithms to help   them to solve everyday  problems and manage   core treasury processes.  This does not demand  the latest technology or  specialist software, though  such tools can help. Once  you have devised a method  (aka algorithm) to complete a  task, you can use productivity  tools such as the spreadsheet  Microsoft (MS) Excel and  other software applications   in the family (such as Outlook  and Word) to automate this.

Treasurers who are not   on first-name terms with   the formulas and functions  in MS Excel, or able to  programme using Visual  Basic, may be surprised by  what Fell can achieve.

Nonetheless, there are  still good reasons to keep  a watching brief on what  algorithms make possible,   as this evolves.  Adam Gable, a treasury  specialist with the banking  software vendor Temenos,  has high hopes for the future,  which he shares by explaining  how a corporate treasury  in a global operation could  exploit rule-based algorithms  to manage liquidity and  ensure the best return on  surplus.  Unless there is a  clear strategy around this  and the ability to execute the  same swiftly, it is difficult to  achieve optimal returns,” he  says. A manual process can  be repetitive, exhausting  and create delays that lead  to potential loss of good  opportunities to invest.    An algorithm that could  assess liquidity across the  group, identify surplus,  assess market rates for  the instruments under  consideration and then  identify the best asset class  and provider, even suggesting  currency conversions where  appropriate, would certainly  have legs,” he says.   But there are even more  impressive possibilities  shimmering on the horizon.  He adds:  Introduce machine  learning, which, given the  time of the month and year,  could predict the most  optimal trade, and we are in  corporate treasury utopia.”   An algorithm is any  specific method,  process or set of  rules that can be  used to complete  a clearly defined  task, which could  be processing data,  solving a problem  or achieving a goal    2 3  1  48  The Treasurer November 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  PERFORMANCE RATIOS ARE  IMPORTANT, BUT OFTEN MIXED  UP. DOUG WILLIAMSON OFFERS  CLARITY TO HELP YOU AVOID  THE RED HERRINGS  SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K  WINNING  PERFORMANCE   Treasurers need to make decisions  based on the financial performance  of many different organisations,  including our own. So we need to  understand how to evaluate financial  information in a rigorous and consistent way.  It s not just profits Profits are vital, especially to shareholders  and other investors. But how much  investment does the business need, to   earn the profits? If the capital investment   is too great, the profits aren t so attractive.  Return on capital Treasurers use ratios to compare different  businesses. For example, return on   capital ratios divide profit by capital, to  calculate a percentage rate of return on   the capital investment.  Return on capital  Profit   ÷ Capital  = Rate of return %  Treasurers need to understand Return on capital is a fundamentally  important performance measure.   Key applications for treasurers are to: •  Appraise business investment proposals; •  Evaluate creditworthiness; and •  Support investor relations.  Different perspectives Return on capital ratios include: •  Return on equity (ROE); and •  Return on capital employed (ROCE,      sometimes pronounced  rocky ).  Practitioners vary both the measure of  profit and the measure of capital, depending  on which investors they re considering.  ROE ROE is an essential ratio for shareholders.   It looks at the after-tax profits earned for  shareholders, using the shareholders    equity capital.   ROE  Investors Shareholders  Profit Profit after tax  Capital Equity  Better or worse? Let s see how the treasurer uses ROE to  take a shareholder s perspective, to analyse  two different companies. Their financial  performance includes:   Company A B  $m $m  Profit after tax 6 7  ÷ Equity 40 80  = ROE 15% 8.8%  Business skills Qualifications    Company B is earning greater profits   of $7m, compared with Company A s $6m. But Company B is using twice as much  equity capital to earn its profits. Company B   is using equity of $80m, compared with  Company A s $40m.   As a result, Company B is earning an  inferior return of 8.8% for its shareholders,  compared with Company A s 15%.  All other things being equal, Company A  is the better investment.  Avoid red herrings Like many financial ratios, the final  calculation of ROE is a simple division of  one number by another. The trickier bit   can be remembering what to divide by   what, especially if a question contains   red herrings.  Red herrings are non-relevant  information, which is potentially distracting.  Exams often contain one or two red   herrings, to test our practical ability   to identify and use the relevant   information only.  Company C  Company C has reported: operating profit  €12m, profit after tax €7m, equity €70m and  non-current liabilities €30m.   Calculate the return on equity. Based on CertTF 2016 question  Relevant information The information we need for our ROE  calculation is the profit after tax of €7m,   and the equity of €70m.   ROE (€m)  Profit after tax   ÷ Equity  7   70  = ROE 10%  The other data in this question isn t   relevant for the ROE calculation.   However, it would be relevant for ROCE.  ROCE perspective The important difference between ROE   and ROCE is their perspective:  •   ROE assumes the viewpoint of the   shareholders only; while •   ROCE takes the wider perspective of all   capital providers, not just shareholders.  Profit and capital To reflect this wider perspective, ROCE s  profit and capital measures are both  different. Keeping it simple at this stage,  the profit measure is normally operating   Doug Williamson is a  treasury and finance coach  profit. Again, keeping it simple for now, the  capital definition is normally equity plus  non-current liabilities. This wider measure  of capital, defined for the ROCE evaluation,  is known as capital employed.   ROCE  Investors All capital providers  Profit Operating profit  Capital Capital employed  ROCE for Company C We ve already calculated Company C s   ROE as 10%. Now let s calculate its ROCE.  The information we need is:  Operating profit = €12m Equity = €70m Non-current liabilities = €30m  Now we need two steps:  (1) Capital employed; then  (2) ROCE.  (1) Capital employed This is the total of equity and non-current  liabilities:  70 + 30 = €100m  (2) ROCE  ROCE (€m)  Operating profit   ÷ Capital employed  12   100  = ROCE 12%  Using financial statements The treasurer often needs to extract  important information from financial  statements. For example, Company D s  financial statements include:  Profit or loss (€m)  Operating profit   Interest and tax  24   (10)  Profit after tax 14  Financial position (€m)  Equity  Non-current liabilities  140   60  Capital employed 200  Company D  Using the financial statements (above),  calculate company D s: (a) ROE; and (b) ROCE.  Answers below   Refining ROCE assessment Depending on the context, and available  information, the ROCE evaluation is  sometimes refined. We might refine either  or both of:  (a) The capital measure; and (b) The relevant profits.  (a) Capital employed: refinements Two potential adjustments are:  (1)  Short-term borrowings, if they are  being used as part of longer-term  capital, to add to capital employed; and  (2) Cash and cash equivalents, to net off.  It s essential to confirm all definitions in  practice, and then apply them consistently.  (b) Profits and tax Profits for the ROCE evaluation are  sometimes after tax. When ROCE is used  in value-added analysis, it is always after  tax. This is because the tax authorities must  always be paid first. Any remaining surplus  for the investors will be after tax.

This month, there is an opportunity to join that effort by entering or nominating your  organisation for The Treasurer s Deals of the Year Awards   a chance to flag up the transactions and  initiatives that really put your organisation ahead of the pack. For more details on how to enter,  turn to page 9.  Elsewhere, tax has been exercising us this month. In July, G20 finance ministers endorsed a  15-point action plan from the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)  with the laudable aim of limiting aggressive tax planning on the part of multinationals and levelling  the playing field across businesses.  The project   base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)   has been many years in the making.  However, while the OECD has worked to create a way for governments to sign up to the initiative  without surrendering their business-friendly credentials, BEPS is not without its implementation  issues and headaches for treasurers. Business journalist Michelle Perry explores the issue in our  lead feature on page 22.  This month, we get to look over the shoulder of Microsoft s structured finance guru in Dubai.  Rahul Daswani, group treasury manager, plays a pivotal role in securing sales by evaluating the  credit risk and liquidity needs of the tech giant s customers and channel partners for the region.   It s a standout example of how treasurers can support their organisations by being closely focused  on solutions. Business journalist Ben Poole s profile of Daswani begins on page 18.  Our issue this month has a special focus on cash management. Rebecca Brace gives an overview  of innovations in payments on page 28 and, in addition, we look at the cash conversion cycle across  Europe, trends in payments and settlements across the globe, and cash mountains   why they exist  and whether corporates are likely to do away with them any time soon.

Retail sales and  consumer confidence  have rebounded and  the economy has been  assisted by a weaker  pound and the Bank   of England rate cut, say   commentators. However,  business confidence has  fallen in Europe, and  inflation in the UK and   on the continent is low.  At the time of writing,  secretary of state for  Exiting the European  Union David Davis  (pictured, right) has  not given details on  the direction Brexit  negotiations would   take or when they would  begin. However, he has   indicated that the UK  will try to negotiate a  bespoke relationship with  the EU versus a solution  such as membership of  either the European Free  Trade Association or the  European Economic   Area. The government has  indicated that it is unlikely  to trigger Article 50, which  starts negotiations to leave  the EU, until next year.  The apparent  postponement has drawn   fire from Europe. Erik  Schweitzer, head of the  German chamber of  commerce and industry,  criticised prime minister  Theresa May s decision   to postpone Brexit talks  until next year, telling   the Financial Times:    The deadlock is creating  a situation in which many  investments are now held  up and will not be carried  out because people   don t know what the   conditions will be over  three or four years.”  Meanwhile, Donald  Tusk, president of the  European Council, has  said that starting the  negotiations as soon   as possible is in   everyone s interests.  BRIEFING  06  The Treasurer October 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  { CORPORATE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT }  EUROPEAN CORPORATES TAKE   BOND YIELDS INTO NEGATIVE TURF  Henkel, a German consumer  goods group, and French   pharmaceutical business Sanofi  became the first private corporates  to sell bonds with negative yields,  last month.  The milestone issues are a further  indication of how central bank  measures to reduce borrowing costs  for governments and companies are  upending market practices.  Henkel successfully issued a  €500m two-year bond with an initial   yield of -0.05% and a couple of 0%.  It is one of four tranches across three  currencies, with the other three  tranches at 0% or positive yields.  Henkel also issued a €700m   five-year bond with a coupon and  yield of 0% pa; a $750m three-year  bond with a coupon of 1.5% pa and   a £300m six-year bond with a coupon  of 0.875%. The initial yields for the  dollar and sterling bonds are 1.55%  and 0.95% respectively.  The acquisition of Sun Products  is valued at €3.2bn and will be  financed by a three-year bank loan  of €1bn in addition to the proceeds  of the bonds.  Sanofi sold €1bn of three-and-  a-half-year debt, also at a yield   of -0.05%.  With yields in negative territory,  backers are paying to invest, but  if bond yields fall even more,   bond price rises and investors can  sell the bond at a profit. Central  banks are notable buyers, with the  European Central Bank expanding  its quantitative easing programme to  include corporate bond purchases in  June this year.  The ACT s associate policy and  technical director, Steve Baseby, said  corporates may find negative yield  debt attractive for new investment  or refinancing, but their business  returns will also be under pressure,  so they will need to consider  whether they are ahead in the round.    More immediate concerns are  that any surplus cash generated by  the bonds may earn an even more  negative yield. What is unknown is  whether these bonds are attractive   as an alternative to government debt,  and cause debt investors to diversify  into corporate debt,” he said.

The Global Fintech Hubs Federation  (GFHF) will cover more than 20 countries,  including Canada, China, Germany, Mexico,  Switzerland and the UK, and has been formed  in partnership with Innotribe   the financial  services innovation wing of worldwide  payments network SWIFT.  As well as its ambition to support global  engagement on fintech matters and industry  best practices, the GFHF will also develop a  global set of knowledge standards in the field  and build bridges between member hubs.   It will provide fintech hubs with a global   voice in the business and finance community.  While Innovate Finance and Innotribe have  stressed that the GFHF will be a cooperative  rather than competitive organisation, it will   nonetheless rank its member hubs according  to several criteria   such as ease of doing  business, talent and capital availability.  Innovate Finance CEO Lawrence  Wintermeyer said:  Coordination and cross- border dialogue between emerging fintech  start-ups, established fintech companies,  financial institutions and policymakers remains  key for the long-term success of our sector.   The launch of the GFHF will provide a  platform for global fintech players and hubs  to share knowledge and build an inclusive  community network. This will help to  accelerate the growth and influence of   global fintech, and shape a better financial  services future.”  SWIFT and Innotribe global head of  securities markets Fabian Vandenreydt said:   Innotribe looks forward to foster a bigger  and stronger fintech ecosystem through this  initiative, bringing its expertise and leveraging  its network for the benefit of the banking and  start-up communities.”  { CONTEXT OF TREASURY }  EBRD to publish  data on NPLs  Details of non-performing loans (NPLs) in  emerging Europe are to be detailed in a new   online resource from the European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).  The bank has launched the website with the  aim of gathering as much policy and finance  industry research as possible around poorly  performing loans in the Central, Eastern and  Southeastern region, which, it says, has some  of the highest and most persistent levels of  Europe s €1.1 trillion in NPL stocks.   The EBRD says sharing information about  NPLs will help strengthen the banking system  within Europe s emerging countries.  The bank says it hopes the resource will aid  transparency and the development of frameworks  that will promote efficient restructuring.  { KEY FINDINGS FROM THE CAPGEMINI WORLD WEALTH REPORT 2016 }   EU member states have a  sovereign right to determine their  own tax laws.

Data from SWIFT show renminbi  use in payments sent from and received by  South Africa increased by 65% over the past   12 months and by 112% over the past two years.  The increase marks strengthening trade  ties between South Africa with China and  Hong Kong.  The establishment of a renminbi  clearing centre in South Africa, as well as  Singapore s increased use of the renminbi  for payments with South Africa, have been a  catalyst for renminbi growth in the region,” says  Harry Newman, head of banking at SWIFT.  The data also show how one country s  increasing use of the renminbi can benefit  existing financial centres for the currency.    While South African institutions have  been stepping up renminbi payments with  counterparties beyond Hong Kong and China    and Singapore has been a notable beneficiary  of this   the growth in overall volumes of payments from South Africa this year means   that payments exchanged with Hong Kong and  China are much higher than they were at the  end of 2015,” says Vina Cheung, global head of  renminbi internationalisation, global liquidity  and cash management, HSBC.    South Africa is still in the early stages of  renminbi adoption, but we believe there is  considerable potential for growth in payments  exchanged with this key African economy and  other emerging markets.”  { AROUND THE WORLD IN 30 DAYS }  BoE SETTLEMENTS, AIRLINES, INVESTMENT BANKS BoE settlements to   be  blockchain ready  Non-bank payment providers  will be able to access a new  payments settlement system,  according to proposals  published by the UK s   central bank.  The Bank of England (BoE)  has released information about  a replacement for its 20-year- old Real-Time Gross Settlement  system, which daily handles  around £500bn of payments  between banks.  The new system will be  compatible with distributed  ledger technology and capable  of operation 24 hours a day,  seven days a week. The current  system operates 12 hours per  working day.  The BoE will conduct a  public consultation closing in  December and publish a final  plan early next year. Volatility hits Asian airlines  FX volatility has damaged  performance at China s biggest   state-run airlines, according to  figures released by the Shanghai  Stock Exchange.  Profits at China Southern  Airlines were down 10.4%   for the first half of 2016, while  profits at China Eastern Airlines  fell 9.3%. At Air China, profits  fell 17.5%.  A 6% devaluation of the yuan  between August last year and  the end of June this year was  cited as the cause.  Southern s chairman, Wang  Changshun, said that his  carrier had worked hard to  mitigate its problems through   advanced repayment of US- dollar liabilities” and a swap  of its dollar obligations under  finance leases, reducing its  commitments around the   US currency.  In tandem with that,  he added:  The financing  proportion of renminbi   increased to 50.8% from 31.7%  at the beginning of the year    therefore, the impact of the  exchange loss decreased.” Income fall at investment banks In the biggest fall in revenues  since the global financial crisis, the world s biggest investment  banks took a 15% hit on their  combined income.  A lack of deals, together with  falls across stocks, bonds and  commodities, were behind the  fall, particularly in the first  quarter of 2016, according to  a report from London-based  research outfit Coalition.  Income from trading stocks  and bonds, advising on M&A  and capital raising, was $79bn  for the half year, down from  $93.3bn in the first half of 2015.   Coalition says the banks  expect the picture to improve  over the second half of 2016.  However, regulation around  capital and risk-taking are likely  to keep a lid on growth.  Asian airlines suffer as  a result of FX volatility    This year marks two  decades of the outstanding  achievements of corporate  treasurers and their teams   Celebrating 20 years  of treasurers  deals   Nominations will soon be under way for The Treasurer s Deals of the Year Awards 2016. And what  better way to showcase your  achievements among the most  talented and innovative treasury  and finance professionals than by  making the cut in its 20th year?  The first deals officially recognised,  in 1997, were those of UK companies  deemed noteworthy   in other words to  have  caught the eye  of The Treasurer. And  all against a backdrop of the Asia financial  crisis, Hong Kong s return to Chinese rule,  a second term for Bill Clinton and, in the  UK, Tony Blair becoming prime minister,  the Financial Services Authority coming into  being and the Bank of England being given  independence by Chancellor Gordon Brown   to set interest rates. Among the winners were  ICI s acquisition financing to buy Unilever s  speciality chemical business, Stakis s foray  into the private placement market, Castle  Transmission International s bond offering  to refinance debt, and The Daily Mail and  General Trust s exchangeable bonds.  Since this comparatively understated  start, The Treasurer s Deals of the Year   Awards have grown and evolved  from an inaugural awards lunch in  2003 at Cazenove, where a shortlist  of winners in six categories were  voted for by ACT members and   Treasurer readers, to the first dinner  event held at Drapers  Hall to mark   the 10th anniversary. The 2007 awards also  saw the launch of a new category   Treasury  Team of the Year. This become two awards    split into large and mid-cap team categories  the following year   and in 2012, the ACT  included an award for the European Treasury  Team of the Year. But what hasn t changed is  the recognition of excellence and celebration  of the far-ranging successes across all aspects  of treasury   the standout and applause- worthy achievements from the treasurer s  point of view, judged on the merits of the  deal as a treasurer would see it.  Over the past 20 years, deals nominated  have totalled over $2 trillion and we ve  had more than 2,500 nominations. The  league table of repeat winners is impressive    Arqiva, Barratt Developments, British  American Tobacco, Essar Energy, ICI,  Merck, Rolls-Royce, SABMiller, Sky, Tesco,   { AWARDS CATEGORIES } Overall Deals of the Year winner  Bonds with a currency value above £500m   or equivalent  Bonds with a currency value below £500m   or equivalent  Corporate finance  Loans above £750m  Loans below £750m  UK Treasury Team of the Year (market   cap above £2bn)  UK Medium-sized Business Treasury Team   of the Year (market cap below £2bn)  European Treasury Team of the Year  The Co Op, Vodafone   and is topped by  National Grid, with six wins over the years.

Last year s  European Treasury Team of the Year winner  with Rando Bruns (profiled in next month s  issue) at the helm was Merck, taking it  to equal second place overall along with  Vodafone and the then Cadbury Schweppes.  The distinguished Deals of the Year  Awards panel comprises experts and  practitioners from across the spectrum of  corporate finance and funding. The roll call  of chair of the panel of judges over the years  has included: Joanna Parker FCT, Matthew  Hurn FCT, Jono Slade FCT and Lesley  Flowerdew FCT. This year, we are delighted  to welcome a new chair   Philip Learoyd  AMCT, head of funding and treasury risk  at SABMiller. Our thanks also go to Lloyds  Bank, which began its long-standing support  of the awards back in 2005.  The deadline for nominations is   18 November and winners will be announced  at the Deals of the Year Awards Dinner  in February next year.

Elsewhere, we are monitoring the development of the Brexit plan and continue  our conversations with regulators and key decision-makers to ensure that the  voice of the corporate is heard. Further afield, EU money market fund (MMF)  legislation evolves, while the new US MMF rules come into being this month     make sure your policies remain effective.  If you have views you d like to share with the ACT policy and technical team on any of these subjects or have your own submission you are willing to share,  please email us at technical@treasurers.org  The Bank of England (BoE)  has started its next phase    of quantitative easing (QE):  the attempt to stimulate  investment by lowering  long-term lending costs by  competing in the markets   to buy UK government and  corporate debt.  This follows the lowering of  the base rate to 0.25%, to lower  further short-term investment  yields and encourage cash  holders, individuals and  businesses to risk their deflating  cash asset on other assets.  The problem the UK shares  with other Western economies  is that the acceptable stimuli  have become few. The BoE  has base rates and QE, a target  consumer price inflation of  2% (currently 0.6%), coupled  with a commitment to a  stable financial system. The  government of the moment  can tinker with tax rates and/ or overspend (that is, borrow).  Simple and crude weapons in  the battle for growth.  However, investment  decisions are not simple  or uniform in their nature.  Business needs to consider  the reliability and cost of  supplies, and the likelihood  of customers at the right  price, while satisfying a host   that they do not have financial  regulation equivalence in its  place (see passporting and  equivalence primer, opposite).  Non-financial businesses,  which comprise the bulk   of our members  employers,  also have uncertainty over  equivalence; the future form  of environment and labour  laws and practices, and,  more critically, continued  access to overseas supplies  and customers on terms  that enable their UK-based  businesses to thrive.  One flaw in the QE  argument is that too much  simultaneous change  becomes difficult to digest.  The variables in the business  plan become too many. The  best-case and worst-case  scenarios move further apart.  Where you may end up in the  gap between becomes less  certain. A lower cost of debt  only assists to ameliorate the  broader uncertainty, and the  borrower may wish to do no  more than use borrowed funds  to distribute to shareholders,  many of which are not UK  domiciled, thereby passing  on the investment decision  beyond the UK.  Another flaw of QE is that  the buyers of UK debt remain   substantially the long-term  funds, including the defined  benefit (DB) pension funds   of many borrowers. Beyond   a requirement to invest part of  their funds in low-yielding gilts,  these DB funds  mismatch of  assets and liabilities is worsened  by the use of long-dated gilt  yields (whose rates are lowered  by QE) as the discount factor  to value the fund.  The UK has so long a history  of DB pension funds that  even those that closed theirs  years ago still have DB funds,  because we have become very  good at staying alive, and so  the assets accumulated in the  past cannot meet the forecast  liabilities of today.

In the meantime, we will  continue to argue that QE may  aid financial market stability,  but it cannot be relied on   to stimulate the commercial  sector, which must reconcile  uncertain times for its  business with an increasing  social welfare liability.  Broader-based stimuli, which  are focused on areas of need,  are required, and for this we  must look to the chancellor  and not the BoE governor,  whose remit is too limited.

The  Securities and Exchange  Commission Rule 2a-7  defines the quality, maturity  and diversity of investments  allowed in MMFs. A significant  Rule 2a-7 change is the  introduction of variable (or  floating) net asset value funds  for prime, ie non-government,  MMFs. The US Association of  Financial Professionals  2016  liquidity survey found that 62%  of corporates plan to make  changes in how they invest  in prime funds as a result of  these reforms. European MMF  regulatory changes are still a  work in progress, with trialogue  negotiations taking place and  a possibility of seeing the final  text before the end of 2016. The Global Financial Markets  Association has issued  a report, commissioned  from Oliver Wyman, called  Interaction, Coherence, and  Overall Calibration of Post   Crisis Basel Reforms. The report  provides a comprehensive  analysis of the potential costs  of the new Basel standards   on lending and capital markets.  Overall, it estimates that the  median increase in funding  cost for loans is 60-84% bps.

In late August,  the Polish government issued  a three-year ¥3bn bond with  a yield of 3.4%.

Key  developments in the panda  bond market were outlined  in The Treasurer (July/August  2016, page 32).  { WATCH THIS SPACE }  Regtech   the new fintech? Even while some of us are still   getting our heads around fintech   and what it means in practical   terms for our organisation, there  is a new kid on the block: regtech  (regulatory technology   the use   of technology to deliver solutions   to regulatory requirements).   And, this time, the practical  application may be more apparent   to treasurers.  Firms want to comply with  ever-expanding, but frequently  inconsistent, regulatory requirements;  regulators want to make use of   the information provided   at   present, neither of these things   are happening efficiently.   Furthermore, as all the theories  tell us, data needs to be accurate,  secure, timely and standardised, and  reporting needs to be cost-effective,  flexible and timely to comply with  whatever the regulators require.   This is where regtech comes in.  Regtech solutions are being  designed to provide consistent  interpretation of the rules,  compliance and the automation of  reporting by taking standardised data  from legacy systems and having the  flexibility to manipulate it into the  reporting formats that the various  regulators require. The magic of  regtech (in theory) is that one set   of data can be cut in many different  ways to provide the information  required by different regulators and,  as a result, it helps firms automate  compliance tasks and reduce  operational risks associated with  compliance and reporting obligations.  Ultimately, it might even provide  a solution for the agony for most  corporates that is KYC…  { INTERNATIONAL/BREXIT }  PASSPORTING AND EQUIVALENCE   A PRIMER   The UK has the largest financial services industry in the EU and, post-referendum, the small matter of  how this industry will continue to operate looms large.   Passporting, which is how the industry operates   at present, is a European Economic Area (EEA)   right and, subject to meeting any conditions under   a relevant single market directive (for example,  Solvency II), a firm authorised in an EEA state   is entitled to carry on permitted activities in any  other EEA state by either exercising the right of  establishment (of a branch and/or agents) or  providing cross-border services.   For the UK, one post-Brexit model mooted is the   Norway  model; a member of the European Free  Trade Association and so in the EEA, Norway has   passporting rights in exchange for free movement  of people. This may not be acceptable to the UK for  political reasons (free movement of people being the  major issue for the UK electorate), and so an alternate  solution would be required   perhaps equivalence.  Equivalence rests on ensuring that similar  regulatory outcomes, such as reducing systemic risk  in the financial markets, are achieved irrespective of  regulatory framework. This is the way that countries  such as the US currently  trade  within the EU.  As current UK regulation is based on EU rules,  establishing equivalence should be relatively  straightforward, and the UK would  just  need to  demonstrate that future changes in regulation do not  impact the outcome from a systemic risk perspective.

Working in finance roles at Centrica, I was  responsible for negotiating the project financing  of our operating offshore wind portfolio. From  there, it was a small step into the treasury team. What do you like about treasury? I love working with bright and enthusiastic  people on problems that have a real   value impact on the company. It is a great  combination of analytical problem-solving and  team working. What s the best thing about being a treasurer? Feeling that I make a difference. What s the best thing about being a member  of the ACT? It s the confidence that comes with being  a member of a respected professional  organisation that seeks to lead the development  of the treasury function. Which ACT qualifications do you hold?  I have just got my AMCT and I m taking a  breather while thinking about the MCT. How has your qualification benefited you in  your career so far? It is a great way of getting the theoretical  knowledge to underpin practical experience. It  provides you with confidence to work your way  through problems efficiently and effectively.  What would be your best piece of advice to  someone else considering a career in treasury? Make sure that you get a range of experiences  in your early career so that you can build on  strong foundations. What s your ultimate career goal? To feel that I have used my skills in the best   way I can to add value and make a difference  for myself and the company I work for. If you weren t a corporate treasurer, what  would you be and why? We got our first dog recently, who is a  hyperactive bundle of joy, so perhaps a dog  walker   more exercise and lots of affection.

Before wading into the  specifics of the Apple tax row,  it s important to set the debate  in its proper context. Everyone  knows of the distinction  between tax evasion and   tax avoidance, the one being  illegal and the other… well,  some companies used to argue  that it was a fiduciary duty   to pay as little tax as possible  by whatever legal means   were available.  Many companies did it,  and perhaps oddly, until  quite recently, there wasn t  much of a public outcry  against it. To the contrary,  lots of governments regarded  tolerance of avoidance as a  form of tax competition, a way  of attracting multinationals to  their particular tax jurisdiction.  The public mood has  changed. Particularly since  the financial crisis, voters have  demanded that companies  pay their fair share. Nothing  Apple did was illegal, and  what s more, it was positively  encouraged to act in the way   it did by the Irish government.  Complicating matters further   is the fact that no government  has yet got its head around  how to tax digital income.  In the virtual world, where  precisely the profit is being  generated is frequently a  matter of interpretation.  In any case, Europe s  competition commissioner,  Margrethe Vestager, has  declared that sweetheart   deals of the type Ireland  struck with Apple are a form  of illegal state aid. Notionally,  at least, the EU is still meant  to be a collection of fiscally  independent nations, but  there is no denying the force  of her argument. If you   aspire to a single market,   a harmonised corporate tax  system is the next logical step.  Even so, what she s done  is a clear case of over-reach.  As things stand, there is no  agreement within Europe  to harmonise taxes, and  there is highly unlikely to   be one in any foreseeable  future. The  double Irish  with a Dutch Sandwich   and other tax-avoidance  schemes with no legitimate  business purpose are being  phased out systematically by  the G20, and by new rules  from the Organisation for  Economic Co-operation and  Development, which seem to  command a high degree of  international consensus. The  global machinery for  profit  shifting  will face a new regime  by 2018.  In any case, until the  world s largest economy,   the US, reforms its own  corporate tax system, none   of this is going to get properly  addressed. The US both  imposes one of the highest  rates of corporation tax in the  world, and is extraordinarily  aggressive in attempting to   tax the overseas profits of   its multinationals. Many US  corporations, Apple included,  thereby have a positive  incentive to generate and   keep profits offshore, and   will naturally gravitate to the   lowest tax jurisdictions in   so doing. In Apple s case,   and that of many others,   the situation has become  positively absurd, with the  company borrowing heavily   in the US to finance dividends,  buybacks and investment  alongside an offshore cash  mountain, which had swelled  to more than $200bn at the  last count.  One of the few decent  policies so far announced  by Donald Trump in his  presidential bid is to slash  the corporate tax rate to 15%  and give additional tax breaks  for repatriated profits. This  would neatly solve the Apple   problem , but it would also   be a double blow to the   EU, which might find itself  losing inward investment   and, indeed, overall tax  revenue accordingly.  Vestager s ruling has  brought the prospect of  serious US tax reform that  much closer. It s all very   well trying to make Europe s  internal market into a model  of level playing field fairness,  but there is always going to   be someone attempting to use  tax policy to attract business.  Who knows? Post-Brexit, it  might even be Britain.   The European Commission s competition commissioner says Apple s arrangements   with Ireland amount to state aid, putting the EU at odds with international agreement  JEREMY WARNER { CORPORATE TAX }  Some companies used to argue  that it was a fiduciary duty to   pay as little tax as possible  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer October 2016 The Treasurer  13  COMMENT  SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K  See page 22 for more on international  developments in corporate tax    A new starting point   for treasury success   treasurers.org/success  TREASURY.

Crossing the line  between monetary policy and fiscal policy  seriously risks undermining the hard-  won credibility of central banks. Second,  monetisation of fiscal spending would be  hard to reverse. Government debt is the  primary asset central banks buy and sell  in order to conduct normal operations.  Without the corresponding assets on   the balance sheet, the central bank might  find itself short of assets to sell to the  market in order to mop up any excess  money in the economy in the future.  Third, helicopter money would  seriously risk creating excess inflation.  Arbitrarily increasing demand without  increasing supply is a recipe for higher  prices. History paints a clear picture.  Excessive inflation is far more likely  than excessive deflation. Given a choice  between either today s world of high  employment, slow-ish growth and  low inflation, or a 1970s world of rapid  inflation and high unemployment, the  former is surely better.   Helicopter money will never fly.  Excuse the pun. You might have  heard some commentators talking   about it, but what is it? Helicopter   money was first introduced as a thought  experiment by monetary economist and  Nobel laureate Milton Friedman in 1969  to illustrate the potential inflationary  impacts of monetary policy. Though  Friedman never intended the idea as   a serious policy proposal, worryingly,  helicopter money has become vogue   in some circles as the panacea to deliver  developed world economies from their  growth fatigue and lowflation. But as  Friedman pointed out,  there is no such  thing as a free lunch”.   The principle of helicopter money is  straightforward. The central bank creates  new money, and rather than buying assets  in order to introduce the cash into the  economy, as it normally would, the central  bank transfers the money to economic  agents without exchanging any assets, as   if throwing the money from a helicopter.   Proponents of helicopter money say   the easiest way to pull it off would be   to finance a one-time tax cut or increase  government spending. The government  would act like a middle man, facilitating  the transfer of cash from the central   bank to the private sector. Unlike normal  fiscal expansions, the government need  not issue any bonds with a helicopter  drop. Public deficits and debt would  remain unchanged.   Private businesses and households  would invest and spend the windfall,  stimulating aggregate demand, generating  growth and a rise in inflation. In essence,  the  drop  facilitates a fiscal expansion  that would never have to be paid back.  Sounds like a free lunch? It isn t.   There are several important reasons  why helicopter money is a very bad   idea. First, it would, in effect, re-politicise  central banks that had gained  independence and credibility during   More importantly, extreme policies  should only be considered when other  policy measures are not available or  possible. First and foremost, across the  developed world, monetary policy is  already ultra easy. Thanks to the relaxed  policies of central banks in the US, the  eurozone, Japan and the UK, the rule   of the day in markets is  no news is good  news . Markets are awash with central  bank liquidity and could easily lend  more to the real economy without much  hindrance if economic participants  demanded loans.   Most developed world economies   are growing at trend. For non-monetary  reasons, potential growth has slowed over  the past decade. In the developed world,  ageing populations, gross imbalances  within and between economies, and a  lack of serious supply-side reform are  preventing a stronger expansion. Growth  is less vigorous than before, and in  conjunction with a weaker appetite for  debt after the Lehman lesson, inflationary  pressures have weakened.   Monetary policy cannot, no matter   how drastic the effort, increase the size   of the engine that drives an economy.  Only other non-monetary policy  measures can do that. Central banks  have powerful tools at their disposal.  Used properly, they can help economies  recover smoothly. Used improperly, as  history reminds us, they can devastate  economies. Helicopter money would be   a dangerous step towards the latter.   Central bankers should  not fly helicopters Helicopter money was never intended to be taken as a credible  policy move.

The next  generation of  leaders may also  have to become  more visible  externally, and  be more involved  in the regulatory   debate, to ensure that any  potential changes don t wipe  out previous initiatives and  that future changes also  benefit them as a business.   Brexit will undoubtedly  bring change and, therefore,  treasuries and businesses will  need to ensure they become  more efficient and better  adapted to how the UK will  operate outside of the EU.  For future treasury leaders,  the skill that will be critical  to success is leadership.  Indeed, treasurers will need  an acute sense of leadership  in order to develop a vision  and strategy adapted to a new  environment, and to drive  the implementation of small-  and large-scale projects.  Leadership skills take time  and effort to develop, and as  future leaders, young treasury  professionals should start  developing those now.   SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K   www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer October 2016 The Treasurer  17  Brexit will undoubtedly bring change,  and treasuries and businesses will   need to become more efficient  As a young treasury  professional, Brexit  represents the single   most impactful political and  economic event that I have  witnessed. It is also a decision  to leave an arrangement that   I cannot remember not being  part of.   Now this decision has   been taken, we are all trying  to understand what it will  mean for the future. It is a  very difficult assessment  to make, and even after  negotiations start and finish,  we will only realise the long- term impact of Brexit in the  next 10 to 15 years.  By then, the current  treasury leaders will have  been replaced by my  generation of leaders. What  will this mean for us? Will  Brexit be an opportunity,  making us approach business  in new and better ways,  supporting our organisations  better than we do now?  Or will Brexit impact us  negatively and hold us back  on the things we could have  achieved if we had stayed in  the EU?  I think Brexit will impact  the next generation of  treasury leaders positively  and negatively.  Most economists foresee a  slowdown in business trading  and consumption. I m not  an expert in macroeconomy,  but intuitively, it sounds  right. UK businesses may   start to see their revenue  and profit fall, and cut costs  to offset worsened trading  performance. In my view,  there lies the biggest risk  for the next generation of  treasury leaders: as budgets  get squeezed, treasurers will  need to do more with less,  and operate with a smaller  budget, often meaning  smaller teams.  What about the impact of  Brexit on treasury activities  and processes? It is only  speculation at this stage, but  what would be the impact  on FX and interest rate risk,  cash and banking, funding,  compliance, tax and so on?  On the cash management  side, will it become more  difficult or costly to pool cash  cross-border, due to tax or  regulatory changes? Will it  be more difficult to attract  funding from European  investors? Will all the  investment made to comply  with European Market  Infrastructure Regulation be  proven worthwhile?  All these questions cannot  be answered at this stage, and  we will only understand the  full implications of Brexit on  the medium term, but what  seems clear is that life as  young treasury professionals  know it, is likely to change.   Which is where I think the  opportunity lies: change is  good! If the future treasurers   budgets get squeezed and   we need to do more with  less, treasury teams will  have to find ways to become  more efficient and effective,  automate processes, and let  go of processes that do not  create value and consume  resources. As competition  for budget and projects will  increase, only the projects  with the highest rate of return  will be approved, overall  increasing the quality of  standards and processes in  treasury, and in the business.  Treasury teams will be  asked to work with the   business to unlock value from  how the business operates.  For instance, potential  difficulties in pooling or  repatriating cash will actually  force the business and  treasury to look at their cash  and banking strategy, and  design and implement the  best solution for the business.   { FUTURE LEADERS }  COMMENT  AGNES FAVILLIER Will Brexit be an opportunity or a setback for the next  generations of treasury leaders?     18  The Treasurer October 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  SWITCHED-  N  TREASURY    PROFILE  While studying to become a chartered  accountant, it became apparent to Rahul  Daswani that a career in public accounting   or audit was not where he pictured his future  professional life.    Many people enjoy roles like that, looking  at a transaction after the fact, seeing what went  wrong and providing a report,” says Daswani,  who today is group treasury manager    structured finance at Microsoft.  But I wanted to  have a career where I am part of creating those  transactions rather than auditing them. That  was what led me to join a corporate, initially   GE Capital, unlike many of my colleagues.”  Having a customer services and operations  role at that company, Daswani learnt the  fundamentals around operations and finance  that would go on to be his specialised field.  Moving to Citibank, he took on various roles,  including work around credit risk management  and product development.  The core of my  work started to revolve around financial risk  analysis and the study of financial statements,”  he says.  That was when I decided that  corporate finance was the area in which   I would like to develop my career. Following  that path, I moved to Nokia and then, through  acquisition, to Microsoft.”   Technology trends Microsoft has a hybrid structure with most  functions centralised in Redmond, in the US,  while some of the sales support functions  like credit services and structured finance are  located around the world. Being a technology  company, its teams are technically savvy and  use Microsoft s own Azure cloud platform  across all its treasury applications.   In structured finance, the clear goal is to  support the sales organisation to sell more by  addressing credit risk and the liquidity needs of  the company s customers and channel partners.  This is achieved through use of third-party  balance sheets.  When the sales and marketing organisation  requires support, Daswani looks at what the  issues are and how a solution may be possible.   Once we have assessed that there is a realistic  solution possible, my role is that of a project  manager,” he says.  I put all the stakeholders  together, get the product from the banks,  explain it internally to get the appropriate  approvals from legal and accounting, and   then execute the transaction by designing   the operational process. It also means that   I need to train the operational team, who will  continue operating it going forward, so I have  oversight of this.”   Funding feasibility  Structured finance as an entity at Microsoft was  established relatively recently, demonstrating  the company s understanding of the need  for the types of solutions it offers. This is  particularly the case for sales in emerging  markets that may not have the same macro  environment as some of the developed markets.    Credit risk is a very important element, but  we are obviously still exposed to some credit  risk after putting a funding structure in place,”  says Daswani.  We look at whether we have  been able to help our sales organisation by  doing a transaction that they would not have  been able to do without our structure. We also  look at the pricing dynamics to see whether  it is viable or not.

My ACT studies have personally helped me to take  concepts and use them in dialogue with stakeholders to properly express   my point of view.” 3   You have to have the latest smartphone. If you don t, then you may not  be as productive, as it really helps with multitasking. And I m not just   saying that to promote Microsoft!” 4   I worked in many different roles before I entered treasury, moving  horizontally to areas such as operations, quality, bank operations, risk  management and business development. That allowed me to learn lots  of different skill sets. This is good to do early in your career before you   have to really specialise. It helped me to get a better perspective of how  companies operate and not have a fixed mindset.”  5   I try not to have a fixed mindset. I want to learn and understand  different points of view. This can be a challenge. In many areas I am quite  opinionated, so sometimes it can be difficult to detach my opinion and   hear someone else s point of view, but it is definitely something that   I always strive to do.”  6   The most difficult question my boss could ask me is one that will  come up during an appraisal: what is the impact you have made? This   is a serious question that requires some introspection. You need to  understand what value you personally bring to the organisation, and   be able to articulate this by describing the challenges you have faced,  the effort you have put in and what that will lead to. It is something you   should always be thinking of.” 7   It can be hard to wind down in the 24/7 work environment, but it is  important to find that time where you can. I like to sit down with my two   young daughters and hear from them about how their day went.”  ROI, this may include looking at the time  you would spend putting the transaction  together, the scalability of the transaction  and how replicable it would be in the  same geography or in another market.”   Enhanced cash flow is a valuable  side effect of some of these structured  transactions, but it is not a key driver.  Growth in revenue and supporting  customers and channel partners remains  the key focus.   I work with a relatively small team  in structured finance, and each of us  contributes to the discussion on how we  can develop the function,” says Daswani.   We look at what we do in one geography  and see how that can translate to other  areas around the world. The fun part  of this role is that we can share strategy  and the way in which we conduct these  transactions. Things will always be  different if you compare Brazil, China,  and Dubai, for example, but if there  is a way to take a successful mode of  operating from one market to another, we  will certainly investigate how to do this.”   Communicating the benefits Like many large global organisations,  Microsoft has a central corporate  plan that is translated down to the  broader field organisation   essentially  a blueprint for success. Whether that  success comes or not depends on how  the company executes the plan.  You  need the resources and also the cutting- edge technology to achieve this group- wide communication,” says Daswani.   We make our own tools like Skype for  Business and SharePoint, so you could say  that we have a built-in advantage here.”  Communication allows everyone to  understand the broader company strategy  and, more importantly, how their team s  goals relate to that broader strategy. Also,  closer ties between the treasury function  and the business allow the value that  treasury adds to the organisation to be  clearly seen, and vice versa.   Treasury is recognised within the  company as a career that requires  specialised skills, and so treasury  qualifications are very important,”   says Daswani, who achieved his AMCT  qualification in 2015.  The company also  encourages us to take on certain roles  outside of treasury in different functions  of the organisation, in order to get a   better understanding of the business.  Staff are then encouraged to come back   to treasury and share their experiences.”     www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer October 2016 The Treasurer  21   Treasury is recognised within the company as  a career that requires specialised skills, and so  treasury qualifications are very important”  Ben Poole is a freelance writer and   editor, specialising in treasury and   transaction banking  RAHUL S CV January 2015-present  Group treasury manager     structured finance, Microsoft July 2012-December 2014  Regional treasury manager     India Middle East & Africa, Nokia  September 2011-June 2012 Manager, local treasury      India, Nokia December 2009-August 2011 Customer finance manager      India & South East Asia Pacific, Nokia December 2007-December 2009  Customer finance manager    India, Nokia  November 2006-December 2007 Business development manager     microfinance, Citibank India August 2004-October 2006  Regional credit manager, Citibank India  October 2002-August 2004 Banking service and operations    manager, Citibank India January 2002-September 2002  Quality black belt,   GE Capital International Services December 1999-December 2001  Operations manager,  GE Capital International Services  QUALIFICATIONS 2013-2015  AMCT: CertRM, CertCFF   and CertITM, ACT  1996-1999 Associate of Chartered Accountants,  Institute of Chartered Accountants   1994-1997 Bachelor of Commerce (H),    Delhi University  PROFILE  VITAL STATISTICS $85.32bn  Microsoft net revenue   $16.79bn  Microsoft net income  38%  YOY growth of net income   compared with 30 June 2015  114,074  Staff headcount worldwide  122  Countries with Microsoft subsidiaries  1975  Year in which Microsoft was founded  Daswani describes studying for the  AMCT as one of the best decisions he   has made, and for more than one reason.    I was studying for the AMCT some  10 to 12 years after I d graduated. It really  helped me refresh my concepts. There  were also parts of the AMCT that were  completely new to me, so I was absolutely  brought right up to date.”  The fact that he was studying for the  AMCT alongside his corporate treasury  role was also a benefit.  When you study  these concepts, they are very real when  you are also practising them in your day  job,” explains Daswani.  A good example  of this is the capital asset pricing model    you don t actually appreciate that until  you spend some time trying to do things  around it in the real world. Then you  understand how you can make the most  out of it in your day-to-day work.”  Middle East markets Being based in Dubai, Daswani has a  prime view of what is happening in the  financial markets of the Middle East.  Naturally, the topic of oil is never far   from the surface.    The development of financial markets  in the Middle East has frankly been  quite slow; for example, there is no good  bond yield curve,” says Daswani.  One  reason for this is the advantage that the  oil economy has provided to this region.  Higher oil prices provided government  revenues that could then be invested  in a broad range of projects. Today s  lower oil prices are changing the status   quo   but it could actually be helpful  in the development of the financial  markets. Most governments will have to  borrow in the near term to manage their  investments, which could help to boost  the financial markets. Countries such  as the UAE and Saudi Arabia seem to  understand that oil volatility is here to  stay, and are now working on regulation  and policies focused on key strategic goals  to provide a sustainable financial model.”   For treasurers operating in the region,  or looking to expand into it, there are a  couple of points that Daswani highlights  as particularly worthy of attention. The  first relates to receivables and credit  risk management.  This is something  that treasuries operating in the Middle  East really need to own; it is the most  challenging area of business in this  region,” he says.  This is best managed   by treasury, as it allows the treasurer to  make longer-term strategic decisions   that impact the cash flow of the company.  Choosing the structure and the way we  function is vital. In the longer term, this  will reduce risk, allowing for lower loss  provisions to be made that will impact   the profit and loss.”  The second point to note is on funding  and FX. Many countries in the Middle  East, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE,  are linked to the US dollar. This has a  tendency to reduce an FX risk element  in people s minds.  You also need to  remember that the dollar depth in these  markets is fairly limited,” states Daswani.   You may think you are in a dollarised  economy, but then any time you want to  raise any sort of financing, it comes at a  much higher cost, particularly if you want  to do longer-term US dollar financing.  It is very difficult to benchmark pricing,  as the bond markets are not very well  developed and yield curves are not very  well established.”  In this scenario, treasurers need to  spend a lot of time negotiating terms,  conditions and pricing, for example.   It is not as transparent as you would  expect, even if the currency is linked to  the dollar,” says Daswani.  Then there are  certain countries that are not at all linked  to the dollar, which bring their own FX  challenges. This is unique to the Middle  East market.”   All statistics taken from the fiscal year   ending 30 June 2016    22  The Treasurer October 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Cross-border initiatives to close tax loopholes  arguably increase risk for corporates and add   to treasurers  workloads, Michelle Perry reports  The Global TAX RULE BOOK    INSIGHT  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer October 2016 The Treasurer  23  With US multinationals among some  of the biggest culprits for aggressive tax  avoidance, tax authorities there have  updated their own tax laws, introducing  the Foreign Account Tax Compliance  Act (FATCA). The US Treasury has also  implemented new country-by-country   tax (CbC) reporting laws from 1 January  2016. Other OECD countries are due   to introduce CbC reporting   action 13   in the OECD BEPS project   next year.  The UK has already taken action   on CbC reporting, meaning that from  1 January 2016, all UK-headquartered  multinationals and UK subsidiaries  of foreign-owned multinationals are  required to provide HM Revenue &  Customs (HMRC) with information  about global activities, profits and taxes  annually for each tax jurisdiction in which  they do business. The Treasury expects to  raise an extra £5m in tax in the first two  years following the introduction of the  new tax rule, and an extra £10m in the  years thereafter.    Some companies will already be  struggling with it [country-by-country  reporting]. It is a disclosure issue, but  you have to consider your situation  and the picture that it gives. HMRC  thinks it will influence behaviour and  not just disclosure,” says Paul Johns,  director treasury and tax at international  construction services company ISG plc.  Action points The UK government has also introduced  new measures to deal with hybrid  mismatch arrangements   action 2   of the BEPS project   which typically  give rise to a tax deduction without a  corresponding taxable receipt, or more  than one tax deduction for the same  expense. The aim is to eliminate the  unfair tax advantages and to encourage  businesses to adopt less complicated,  cross-border investment structures.  The BEPS guidance on action 4   limiting net deductions for interest to   Modern international business  practices have long outgrown the  global tax rules for which they were   intended. Designed in the 1920s, there is  little doubt that the global tax framework  has exceeded its sell-by date, but forging  international consensus to build a new  one has been no easy task.  Over the past decade, governments  have made attempts to close loopholes   in domestic tax laws. Governments  around the world, including the UK,   have imposed a general anti-avoidance  rule. Last year, UK tax authorities  introduced the diverted profits tax   (DPT)   also dubbed the  Google tax .  Plans for an EU financial transaction   tax (FTT) were introduced in 2013   to  temper irresponsible trading”  following the 2007/8 credit crunch,   but member states are struggling to   reach consensus.   In the background to domestic  attempts, G20 nations realised that unless  an effort was made to work collectively,  multinationals bent on reducing their   tax liability would continue to find ways  to do so.  The push to reform international  tax laws has been somewhat aided and  abetted by the media and a growing  public awareness and interest in  how much tax multinationals like  Amazon, Google and Starbucks pay  in certain jurisdictions. For their part,  multinationals, despite defending their  records and doing nothing illegal, have  realised that their reputations are at risk  and have begun working with authorities  to pay more tax.   Since the 2007/8 financial crisis, the  trust in institutions, both government  and business, has been eroded,” says  James Lockyer, development director  at the ACT.  People have looked for  someone to blame, and tax is the  one issue companies have not been  particularly transparent about.”  With a growing political will to tackle  tax avoidance, three years ago, G20  governments and the Organisation  of Economic Co-operation and  Development (OECD) launched the base  erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project  with the aim of curtailing aggressive tax  avoidance. The OECD has produced a  15-point BEPS action plan to which, as    of July 2016, 85 OECD members have  signed. G20 finance ministers, including  then UK chancellor George Osborne,  endorsed all 15 action points.   The OECD has created a menu so  that governments can pick and choose  without being seen as anti-business. It  allows governments to change tax laws  relatively uncontroversially. And OECD  countries mostly have an interest in  cooperating on this,” says John Cullinane,  tax policy director at the Chartered  Institute of Taxation.  The temptation to act independently  of these kinds of initiatives can be hard  to resist. Last month, the European  Commission said Ireland must recover  €13bn from Apple, a sum it regards as tax  avoidance. This kind of breaking ranks is  clearly problematic, but the Commission  says Apple s arrangements with Ireland  amount to state aid. And yet Ireland,   the Netherlands and Luxembourg   have already agreed separately to   close loopholes in their corporate   tax arrangements.  Despite the desire to stem the tax  leakage from government treasuries, the  fall in tax income cannot be entirely put  at the door of multinationals  creative  tax planning. Since the financial crisis,  economic growth has fallen and, with it,  the amount of tax due. So governments  have been trying to balance the need to  ensure they receive the correct amount  of tax due, while also making themselves  attractive to investment. Many  governments, including the UK, have  done this by reducing their corporate   tax rates, as well as attempting to curb   tax avoidance.    Some countries are looking to lower  their corporate tax rate, but broaden the  tax base. While wanting to tighten tax   law to reduce avoidance, countries are  trying to make themselves seem attractive  places to invest in,” says Matthew  Rose, vice president   tax at Seadrill  Management Ltd.   The OECD has created a menu so that  governments can choose without being seen  as anti-business. It allows governments to  change tax laws relatively uncontroversially”    What is important to note is that   few of the measures in the OECD BEPS  project are entirely new to the UK tax  system. Treasurers and heads of tax at  multinationals will already be familiar  with many of these types of taxes, such  as withholding tax (WHT) and transfer  pricing rules.  On BEPS action point 6 on treaty  abuse relating to royalty WHT, the UK  has announced its adoption of three  measures. The first is an anti-abuse  measure with immediate effect, to deny  treaty benefits when royalty payments are  routed through a connected company in a  treaty jurisdiction to gain a tax advantage.   The other two measures extend the  scope of the WHT regime for royalties  to include intangible assets   such as  trademarks and brand names. The  regime will also apply to royalty payments  connected with the activities of a UK  permanent establishment of an   overseas company.  The DPT, which is similar to BEPS  action 13, is a new tax charged at 25% on  profits that are considered to be artificially  diverted from the UK to a related company  with a low tax rate. HMRC updated tax  law on this point last year.   The DPT forces everyone to consider  their group transactions and in particular  the transfer pricing position, along with  any risks and whether they need to notify  HMRC. It s not inconsistent with the  substance of BEPS initiatives, but it is  slightly different,” Rose says.  Implementation Despite the familiarity with the concept  of certain types of tax, the workload is not  to be underestimated.  It s a mammoth  task. All of these new regulatory issues  that affect treasury involve data capture  and you have to change your systems to  manage that,” Johns says.  24  The Treasurer October 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  a percentage of a company s earnings  before interest, taxes, depreciation and  amortisation (EBITDA) is causing slightly  more consternation than other OECD  actions. To meet this, the UK would  need to introduce a new general rule for  restricting interest, which would be a major  change to the UK corporate tax regime, but  it also runs the risk of capturing companies  that do not pose a risk of avoiding tax by  benefiting from the measure.  In its latest submission to the  government s consultation on capping   tax relief on interest on debt, the ACT  says:  BEPS is a poorly targeted tool  intended to affect global multinationals,  but, in fact affecting purely domestic  businesses, which have a history of  using debt capital to achieve growth and  government objectives for development   of UK infrastructure.”  One of the biggest concerns of BEPS is  that companies in multinational groups  are increasingly using leverage and  interest to avoid tax. However, more often  than not, the choice between debt and  equity financing within a multinational  group are commercial decisions rarely  based on pure tax considerations, but  on legal requirements, regulatory  constraints, contractual limitations   and foreign currency implications.  Any company that is thinly capitalised  will be heavily impacted by the new rule  on capping relief, on interest on debt.   SUPPLY CHAIN IMPACT  The OECD BEPS initiative,  and in particular country- by-country (CbC) reporting,  is likely to have an impact  on some companies    supply chains given that  most of the action points  required by the BEPS  project involve greater  transparency through  increased disclosure.  What this means   in practice is that tax  authorities around the  world will be able to see  exactly where a company  makes its profits, how much  tax it is paying in each   country versus profits  made, and how much  business activity there is   in a particular jurisdiction.  Shared service centres  (SSCs) in particular are  likely to come in for closer  scrutiny by authorities.  Over the past two decades,  SSCs have become a useful  tool in better management  of the supply chain. Groups  have sought to centralise  sales, procurement or  finance, for example, to  reduce duplication and  increase efficiency through  reorganising resources and   sharing investments  between business units.  Often, reducing a group s  tax liability   not necessarily  corporate tax, but perhaps  personal taxes   has been   a factor in this decision- making process. Such a  decision may have been  made for clear commercial  reasons, but with CbC  reporting, the intracompany  charges will be magnified.   If a business unit were   to show big profits but   little activity, then tax  authorities will likely  question the structure.  A big concern for treasurers  is that there will be little  consistency in interpretation,  application or in the timing  of BEPS measures across  OECD countries  It is, however, doubtful there are many  companies that are accruing so much  interest on debt that it is taking up all   of their profits. And if that were the case,  experts say, those companies are very  likely facing serious problems anyway.  It is worth noting that the amount of  tax planning in respect of debt is very  different in today s world of record low  interest rates compared with that of more  than a decade ago when interest rates  were in double digits. The opportunities  and benefits of structuring debt based on  reducing tax through interest relief are far  fewer in an environment of historically  low interest rates.  The current time frame for the UK   to introduce the measure is April 2017     a plan that many are less than happy  about. The ACT has expressed caution  at the planned timing, because it  would mean that the UK would be  an  early adopter” of the tax rule,  which  remains under development, and before  understanding how trading partners  intend to implement the initiative”.  The OECD guidance includes  the option for countries to consider  introducing a group ratio rule in  combination with the fixed ratio rule.  Depending on the design of such a rule,  it could ensure that no restriction arises  for domestic groups and stand-alone  companies in respect of interest paid   to third parties.    www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer October 2016 The Treasurer  25  The new tax rules will involve a  significant amount of work for treasurers  in terms of compliance and reporting, and  even though some BEPS measures are still  under consultation, the direction of travel  is clear so treasurers and tax teams can get  to work in preparation for what is likely  to come.    My view is that the response to BEPS  initiatives may be that many authorities  will introduce strong tax laws that could  be perceived as taking a sledgehammer   to crack a nut,” says Rose, who is also   a former treasurer and head of tax at   Royal Mail.   What companies would  ideally like is as much advance  clarity on proposed legislation  as possible to give time to  restructure or reorganise  transactions where necessary”  A big concern for treasurers in general  is that there will be little consistency   in interpretation, application or in   the timing of BEPS measures across  OECD countries.    What companies would ideally like  is as much advance clarity on proposed  legislation as possible to give time to  restructure or reorganise transactions  where necessary. Tax authorities need to  think about the impacts on companies,  but also take into account public  perception for action on tax. However,  for multinational groups operating in  many countries that may introduce a   variety of rules at different times, it could  result in there not being enough time to  restructure everywhere. That s clearly not  helpful,” Rose says.  Governments are treading a fine line in  their desire to increase their tax income,  but avoid penalising legitimate business  practices and simultaneously ensure they  remain attractive to inward investment. It  is a balancing act, especially considering  all the other huge political and economic  decisions facing business over the next  few years.

While cash continued to be  used for 48% of transactions, other  payment methods   such as debit cards  (26%), direct debit (10%) and credit  cards (6%)   together represented more  than half of transactions. This trend   is expected to continue: the Payments  Council (relaunched as Payments UK   in June 2015) also predicted that by   2024, only 34% of consumer payments  will be made in cash.  Meanwhile, the area of payments is  evolving rapidly. From mobile payments  to blockchain, new technology is  reshaping the way that people and  businesses transfer money. While some  of these developments are already in  use, others are more nascent. Innovation  is also breathing new life into traditional  payment instruments, from the launch   of polymer notes to the development   of mobile cheque-imaging services.   Embracing revolution Against this backdrop, to what extent  are treasurers taking advantage of the  opportunities currently presented by   the changing payments landscape?    From a business perspective, we  are seeing corporates reap the benefits  from innovations like contactless cards  and Faster Payments, especially where  they deal with consumers directly,”  comments Natalie Willems-Rosman,  head of payables and receivables,  GTS EMEA, Bank of America Merrill  Lynch.  However, in general, there is  still ground to cover when it comes  to both consumers and businesses  fully embracing the benefits new  technologies have to offer.”  Areas of focus include B2B payment  systems, while debate continues about    www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer October 2016 The Treasurer  29  the role that distributed technology  could play in correspondent banking.  In more established developments,  treasurers should also be asking  whether they can leverage the UK Faster  Payments Scheme more effectively.  Faster Payments Launched in 2008, Faster Payments  was one of the world s first real-time  24/7 electronic payments schemes. Last  year, it processed 1.24 billion payment  transactions with a value of £1,104bn.  Mike Banyard, head of development  for Faster Payments Scheme Ltd, says  there are some interesting use cases  for Faster Payments that are driving  tangible benefits to businesses and their  customers:  From insurance companies  seeing a competitive advantage by being  able to settle claims immediately (no  more waiting for the cheque to arrive)  through to consumer-lending firms  being able to deliver the proceeds of   a loan request within minutes, or firms  that are moving to  just in time  stock  management   ordering and paying  for goods only when they actually need  them,” he says.  MEANS ofEXCHANGE  Payments technology is fruitful territory  for innovation, and new solutions add  speed and efficiency, but a genuinely  revolutionary approach is some way off.  Rebecca Brace looks at developments   There is still ground to cover when it comes to  both consumers and businesses fully embracing  the benefits new technologies have to offer”  MANAGEMENT    30  The Treasurer October 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  These  advantages  are not  always fully  realised.   For many  corporates   in the UK, up until  now, Faster Payments   has mainly been seen as a  get out  of jail  card to play in exceptional  circumstances, such as a delay in payroll  or supplier payment submissions,” says  Banyard.  This has been, at least in  part, because taking advantage of the  immediacy of such payments could  require changes in business processes,  IT systems and service propositions.”  B2B payment systems B2B payment systems represent another  interesting area of development.   Carl Sharman, senior director in  Deloitte s Financial Advisory  practice, notes that there are three  types of B2B payment systems:  •  Those that replace the   traditional role of the bank   (ie M-Pesa);  • Those that work with banks to  provide a service that banks can  offer to their own customers (ie  mobile payments and non-financial  counterparties, prepaid cards, Faster  Payments); and   • Those that use the automated  clearing house (ACH) system to  process payments (ie supply chain  finance multi-bank platforms, such   as Orbian and GT Nexus).  According to Sharman, M-Pesa is the  benchmark for bank disintermediation.  However, he questions whether this  scheme has global scale, having evolved  to fill a need where the existing bank  infrastructure was poor.   The fastest growth potential is in  supply chain financing intermediaries  that facilitate dynamic payments  discounting on a large scale through   multi-bank platforming, as  part of a wider working capital   management programme,”   he says.    Already some huge  multinationals are choosing  these platforms over single-  bank proprietary systems.”  Distributed ledger technology The possible applications of this  technology are certainly interesting.   Distributed ledger has great  potential to bring enhanced features  to the payments landscape,” says  Matthew Davies, co-head of product  management, GTS EMEA at Bank  of America Merrill Lynch.  Some of  these include the ability to carry more  data and, therefore, make it easier for  organisations to reconcile payment  information and use data effectively.”  Davies adds that distributed ledger  technology allows for transactions to  be settled more quickly and around  the clock, and more easily across  geographies.  These features could  potentially be very beneficial for  corporates and can open up all sorts   of opportunities off the back of having  real-time payment confirmations   across the globe, such as entering     new markets.” However, it is important to   note that these benefits may not  materialise any time soon   despite  significant attention given to this   topic in the past couple of years. As  Willems-Rosman says:  It will take time  before we have a clear view of how new  technologies, such as blockchain, could  be fully embedded in the payments  landscape, as the industry is focusing   on how they can be delivered in a  secure, tested and integrated way.”   Everyone gets very excited about  blockchain, but it s interesting to cut  through the hype,” comments Ruth  Wandhöfer, global head regulatory  and market strategy, treasury and  trade solutions, at Citi.  There are a  lot of areas where people are probably  under the impression that blockchain  technology is already extensively being  used in financial services to transfer  financial assets. This is really not the  case   apart from Bitcoin.”  She adds:  Various players in the  blockchain space have reassessed  their proposition and begun to embed  features of this innovative technology,   such as distributed consensus  mechanisms, rather than  replacing existing financial  market infrastructures and  processes altogether, for  example, in the correspondent   banking space.”  Gaining ground Much is changing   but how significant  are these new developments compared  with traditional payment methods?   Sharman argues that technology  such as UK Faster Payments and  mobile payments represent evolution  rather than revolution.  The same  single-ledger banking system applies  (ACH)   but these recent developments  in technology enhance the customer  experience, making it faster and easier  to access it,” he explains.    For example, Faster Payments  artificially speeds it up, as banks take   on the risk through collateralisation.  So if a payment fails in the traditional  clearing process, the claim is against  the bank that has guaranteed it. Hence,  there are upper limits on transaction  amounts to match the banks  collective  appetite for risk.”  Sharman notes that mobile and  internet systems, such as PayPal  and Paym, add a layer of security by   attaching email addresses and  mobile numbers to bank  details, or by using new  passwords. This enables   consumers to access their  accounts in a different way.   Consumers get better access  to their accounts to pay and  receive cash, but essentially  with upper limits dependent  on the risk the new provider(s)  is prepared to take,” he says.  Blockchain technology, in  comparison, offers a genuine  revolution by promising a  new way of accessing value  exchange. However, no system  is infallible.

Opinions differ on when  this will become a reality, but  commercial pressures will push  this along faster than we might  expect, certainly a lot faster  than SEPA implementation.”  At the same time, the UK s  Payment Systems Regulator is  currently consulting on draft  guidance, which looks at how   access is given to certain regulated  payment systems.  The consultation  is looking at what users want, how  access to markets can be improved,  whether this needs to be done through  collaboration or competition between  people, and how best to enable that,”  explains Shaun Kennedy, group  treasurer of Affinity Water.  I think we ll  come through this consultation with a  definite plan for the UK and hopefully  some innovation will come to the fore.”  Payments technology is evolving  rapidly. Some of the most significant  changes currently being developed may  take many years to come to fruition. In  the meantime, however, there are plenty  of opportunities for treasurers to gain  a greater understanding of new and  recent developments, and explore how  these can be used to their advantage.   Rebecca Brace is a  freelance journalist  specialising in  corporate treasury  and banking   www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer October 2016 The Treasurer  31  CUSTOMER CHOICE  Shaun  Kennedy,  group  treasurer    of Affinity Water, says   the utility offers up   all payment methods  regardless of how long  they have been in use.  It s  really important not just to  think about people who ve  got mobiles and are using  all the latest gadgets and  apps, but also to make sure  that the payment systems  continue to serve those  who don t have access to,  or feel comfortable using,  the latest technology,”   he says.  Kennedy notes that   there has been a lot of  innovation around mobile  payments in emerging  economies, such as Africa  and China, which have  skipped ahead of the UK in  some ways.  WeChat, for  example, is fundamentally  a messaging service, but   the way people are   using that to make  payments to each other   is really interesting.”  For Affinity Water,  meanwhile, some of   the most interesting  developments include  those relating to direct  debits.  Direct debit has  been around for nearly   50 years, but some  developments may be  happening here, too,”   says Kennedy.  If I m a  customer who gets paid   on an ad hoc basis, you  might take the direct debit,  but I might not have any  money that day   so the  direct debit will bounce.  One possibility is for the  concept of Request to   Pay. A company sends   me a request for £30 for  my water bill that month  and I can say: actually,   I m not going to accept   it today, but in two days   time, when I know I ve got   money, I ll release the  payment. That idea has  been talked about for a  while and will hopefully  become a reality.”  At the same time, the  ability to include more  detailed information   could make it easier for  companies to match up  incoming payments with  the relevant bills.  As a  water company, we get  payments from lots of  people, but we don t  always know what those  payments are for, because  not everyone includes   their account reference,”  Kennedy explains.  The  ability to interact more  through the payments  system would be useful    for example, by allowing  customers to send a  picture of the water bill  alongside the payment.   I think it will be interesting  to see how that develops  going forward.”  incentive to collaborate” because of the  potential costs they could face as a result  of disintermediation, Sharman argues.   My hunch is that non-financial  applications will lead the way    documentation exchange, for example,”  says Sharman.  Once these are  considered foolproof, the step can be  taken towards value exchange. However,  early adopters will be brave. It would  take a move into commercial  payments to make it worthwhile  on scale, and the levels  of trust needed are  huge. And as the  cost of accessing  traditional  (evolutionary)  methods erodes, then  the touted benefits  may be significantly  smaller by the time  the technology is  considered viable.”  Regulatory developments Meanwhile, regulatory  developments, such as the  revised Payment Services  Directive (PSD2) may  support further innovation in  payments.  PSD2 and changes  in interchange fees will further  promote change and demand  for real-time services   and  the PSD2 may support the  move away from cards for some types of  payment,” comments Banyard.  There   could also be significant implications  for the use of direct debits in future  as end users seek greater real-time  control over their finances.”  The industry is currently working  on an enhanced common ISO 20022  standard, which is specifically  designed to handle real-time   payments, he notes.  This will have  a major impact on the speed at   which cross-border immediate     32  The Treasurer October 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  A detailed look at the cash  conversion and working capital  issues for European companies  reveals a mixed picture, says  Andrew Bale  THE ONE TRILLION  EURO OPPORTUNITY   The year 2015 was not a bad one for the top European companies tracked in REL s Europe Working Capital  Survey. The average cash conversion cycle  (CCC) of the 960 companies surveyed  shrank 1.7% year-on-year as receivables  and payables both improved.  However, some causes for concern  remain. Revenues came at a higher cost  than in 2014, with gross margins slipping  an average of 13.8%. The earnings before  interest and taxes margin fell steeply  (-22.1%), and debt rose 8.3%. There was a  2.9% increase in cash on hand, outpacing  revenue growth (+2%) and Europe s   GDP (+1.9%).  One trillion on the table Net working capital improved relative  to revenue growth, only 0.2% against  2% revenue. However, few companies  have focused steadily on improving their  working capital management. Overall,  Europe s largest and most sophisticated  companies still have an opportunity to  release nearly one trillion euros (€981bn)  now tied up in working capital, the  equivalent of 6.7% of European GDP  (€4.63 trillion). Better management   could represent significant benefits in  each area of working capital (payables,  €349bn; inventory, €328bn; and  receivables, €304bn).  Despite the good macroeconomic  news, only 13.2% of the companies  surveyed managed to sustain  improvement in their CCC for three  years in a row. Indeed, 9% suffered  deteriorating CCC performance for three  years running. Nor did cash conversion  efficiency (CCE, which measures   SCORECARD METHODOLOGY  REL s Working Capital Survey calculates  working capital performance based on the  latest publicly available annual financial  statements of the largest listed non- financial companies with headquarters   in Europe. This year, the survey included  960 companies. The survey takes an  industry-based approach to ranking  companies according to the four   key working capital metrics: days   sales outstanding (DSO), days inventory  outstanding (DIO), days payable  outstanding (DPO) and cash conversion  cycle (CCC). For each industry, the  companies are ranked according to   overall CCC, and the top three and   bottom three performers are listed   in the scorecard.  Companies are classified according   to the industry classification system   and data sourced from FactSet. For  purposes of the survey and presenting  results, we have grouped certain  industries together. Historical  comparisons within the survey are   made on a like-for-like basis. Where  off-balance sheet arrangements are   used by the company, adjustments   have been made to the data in order   to provide true, consistent and  comparable figures.  Days sales outstanding (DSO) =   accounts receivable/(one-day revenue)    Year-end trade receivables net of   allowance for doubtful accounts,   divided by one day of average revenue     A decrease in DSO represents an  improvement, an increase, a deterioration  Days inventory outstanding (DIO) =  inventory/(one-day cost of goods   sold (COGS))    Year-end inventory balance divided    by average days COGS    A decrease is an improvement,    an increase, a deterioration  Days payable outstanding (DPO) =  accounts payable/(one-day COGS)    Year-end trade accounts payable balance   divided by average days COGS    An increase in DPO represents an   improvement, a decrease,  a deterioration  Cash conversion cycle  (CCC) = (DSO + DIO - DPO)    Year-end DSO + DIO -    DPO performance (in  days, as calculated above)     The lower the number   of days, the better  operating cash flow/revenue) improve  much: CCE showed only marginal  improvement for the third time round.  Despite those slight gains, CCE is still  down 3.4% from where it was five years  ago, and the average European firm has  yet to recover to its 2009 position.  Ultra-low interest rates (0.6%) on   loans from the European Central Bank  (ECB) are a key cause of their distraction.   Total indebtedness has increased from   €2.26 trillion to €3.13 trillion since 2010;  and, in the past year alone, has risen by  8.3% as companies have taken advantage  of the ECB s nearly free money.  Much of this money went either into  capital expenditures, M&As or dividend  payments. Capex grew by 5% (€28bn)  in 2015, particularly in biotechnology  (+78%) and internet software and services  (+54%), although there were declines in  energy services and equipment (-23%),  and metals and mining (-14%). M&As  were at a record high, particularly in the  pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and  consumer goods sectors. Dividend payouts  grew by 5% year-on-year, increasing  substantially in pharmaceuticals,  telecommunications and beverages, and  continuing a seven-year growth streak.

High inventory levels and less  advantageous customer and supplier  payment terms have given Sweden and  Finland the highest CCC in Europe.  It s worth noting that the regional best  performers have all improved in recent  years. Belgian companies, for instance,  saw their CCC rise to -9 days from -3,  and the Spanish CCC two-day gain to  9 from 11 days. Overall, only four of the  18 countries tracked by REL improved  their CCC over the past five years: France,  Greece, Portugal and Spain. This is  cause for concern, as it appears that  these countries have focused on working  capital only once they were in the midst   Companies currently hold the rest of  the cash, the equivalent of 11% of revenue.  They have a total of €833bn in cash on  hand, but the holdings are far from evenly  distributed: just nine companies account  for €164bn, 20% of the total.  But as the many US companies that  have also piled on low interest debt this  year are learning, even nearly free money  comes at a price. European companies  that added 50% or more to their debt in  2015 suffered a 20% increase in their CCC.  Slower conversion and an upward trend  in total debt (with above-average overall  debt and lower average cash on hand for  these companies) suggest that European  companies have made themselves much  more vulnerable in the event of a major  shock or disruption to their business.  Countries and sectors swing further The 1.7% average improvement of all the  companies surveyed encompasses much  sharper positive and negative sectoral and  regional swings.  Industry leaders included companies  in marine shipping, which saw their CCC  improve to -9 days in 2015 from -1 day;  internet software and services, which rose  to -5 days from 4 days; and household and  personal care, which climbed to 2 days  from 6 days. The most dramatic negative  changes were suffered by companies  in internet and catalogue retail, which  fell to -3 days from -11 days; wireless  telecommunications, which dropped   to -75 days from -91 days; and wholesale  distribution, which lost two days, rising  to 14 from 12 days. The largest nominal  loss was semiconductors and equipment,  which added 17 days to its CCC total,  bloating to 157 days from 140.  Country performance also varied  dramatically. Belgian companies in the  ranking topped the list for CCC with -9  days, a six-day improvement in overall  performance in 2015, followed by Spain  (9 days) and Portugal (10 days). CCC  stragglers include Finland (77 days),  Sweden (72 days) and Ireland (57 days).  Both Belgium and Spain have longer  payment terms with suppliers.

What should companies expect this year?  The likeliest scenario is for more CCC  improvement. As we forecast in 2015, we  believe that the trend towards faster cash  conversion will continue. However, if, as  expected, many of the largest European  companies continue to gorge on debt,  their overall risks will increase.  Improving working capital practices is  always a good idea, but with the ongoing  uncertainty that seems likely to follow  the Brexit crisis, and no guarantee that  interest rates will remain low, 2016 may  be a particularly opportune time for  companies to reduce borrowing and  concentrate on generating cash through  tighter working capital management.  At the very least, it seems prudent  to strengthen internal processes and  policies around working capital to enable  sustainable cash-flow improvement and to  minimise the cash impact of any potential  deterioration in trading conditions.   What should companies expect this year? The  likeliest scenario is for more CCC improvement    34  The Treasurer October 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Since the global financial crisis, corporates have amassed cash in the billions.   Are they being recklessly prudent or is caution now a fundamental part of the   business landscape? Paul Cowdell takes a closer look   Many financial managers appear  to be sitting behind a wall of cash. Ostensibly, this is a necessary  precaution for the benefit of their  organisations in an uncertain  environment. It is also a very expensive  precaution, one that contradicts  traditional ideas about returning   surplus cash to shareholders if there   are no positive net present value (NPV)  projects available.  Agency theory suggests that some  managers are tempted to be  recklessly  prudent  or overly cautious for career or  personal reasons, ahead of the interests  of shareholders. But what s the truth of  the matter?  Cash mountain origins Cash hoarding by companies seems   to have started around the year 2000,  which coincides with the bursting of   the dotcom bubble.   In the run-up to the millennium,  during a boom in IT shares, investors  began to take a  this time it s different   stance, apparently persuaded that  traditional business valuation  fundamentals had ceased to apply.   Stock markets worldwide peaked in the  wake of the dotcom experience. Then,   in early 2000, reality reasserted itself   and technology stocks lost about 60%   of their value. This was accompanied by  a decline in stock markets worldwide, as  illustrated by the FTSE 100, which traded  at 6930 towards the end of 1999 and  today, almost 17 years later, is currently  still trading below that figure.  Where are we now? Traditionally, treasurers would manage  liquidity on the debt side by techniques  such as revolving credit facilities (RCFs).   CASH STASH However, since the global financial   crisis and the development of Basel III,   RCFs are not as attractive to banks.  Consequently, corporate treasurers who  can t offer attractive ancillary business  face a combination of reduced availability  and/or higher interest and fees for RCFs.  Hence, many treasurers now manage  liquidity via a combination of cash   and debt.   So, while some may argue that  treasurers tend towards being overly  cautious, that caution is a product of  today s business environment. Since  the global financial crisis, treasurers  have concluded that they cannot always  rely on the bank facilities being there  when they need them. Thus, corporates  worldwide continue to build up large  cash balances.   The US has some striking examples.  US businesses collectively have currently  amassed around $1,900bn in cash   on their balance sheets. Specific  examples include:  • Alphabet, Google s parent company,   which has on its balance sheet cash  amounting to $80bn, around 16% of its  total market capitalisation. The $80bn  is enough to fund the purchase of a  controlling interest in Goldman Sachs  or American Express.   • General Motors has cash holdings  amounting to nearly half its market  value, and Apple s balances are almost   a third of its market value.   What s the future Is this situation likely to change in the  near future? In a word, no. A survey by  the Association of Financial Professionals  shows that the recent trend and forecast  trend is for cash balances to increase.  Change   in cash   holdings  Jul 16 Apr 16 Jan 16 Oct 15  (Over the  past year)     +14 +10 +15 +13  Expected  change   (during  current   quarter)  +16 +7  -1 +8  The indicators measure recent and  anticipated changes in corporate cash  balances by calculating the percentage of  survey respondents reporting an increase  (or expected increase) in cash holdings  minus the percentage reporting a decline  (or expected decline). The survey s  authors comment:  Declining indicators  are indicative of increasingly confident  businesses. Conversely, rising indicators  suggest growing pessimism.”   So what does this say about traditional  financial theory? According to agency theory,  the build-up of cash balances serves to:  Corporate treasurers who can t offer  attractive ancillary business face a  combination of reduced availability   and/or higher interest and fees for RCFs  SOURCE: AFP CORPORATE CASH INDICATORS JULY 2016 (WWW.AFPONLINE.ORG/ PUBLICATIONS-DATA-TOOLS/DATA-TOOLS/AFP-CORPORATE-CASH-INDICATORS)     www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer October 2016 The Treasurer  35  to back that  sentiment. But  not all investors  appear happy   about Apple s cash mountain, however.  Activist investors David Einhorn and  Carl Icahn have each campaigned at  times in the past for Apple to return cash  to shareholders. Einhorn even went so   far as to take legal action in 2013.  Investor sentiment is clearly divided  on this issue, and much depends on the  industry, and on investor confidence in  the management.  Research by Rohan Williamson and  Lee Pinkowitz, quoted in Davidson s  article, suggests that, while in some  industries investors support the build-up  of cash balances, in other sectors, such as  defence and coal, investors valued every  $1 of stockpile at a mere 40 cents.  Cost of carry At face value, it makes little sense to   hold cash balances and simultaneously  have borrowings, as the cost of carry   will inevitably work against the company,   and that value destruction effect will  be even greater if, as has been   suggested, banks begin to  charge negative interest rates   on them. However, there are   two possible explanations of this   apparent anomaly.  With Apple, for instance, the  vast majority of cash is held   outside the US and beyond the reach  of the Internal Revenue Service.    If Apple repatriated the cash to the  US, under current tax law, which may  change, it would have to pay about  35% in tax. So long as the US corporate  tax law remains unchanged, it is more  economical for Apple to borrow any  money it distributes to shareholders  from US sources than to use its overseas  cash balances. In 2014, Apple issued a  $17bn bond to fund its buyback, rather  than depleting its cash balances.  It s not just tax that has an impact.  The other advantage of cash mountains  that can be cited to outweigh the cost of  carry argument is the buffer they provide  against economic turbulence.   As Ben Wright, writing in The  Telegraph, put it:  The scars from the  credit crunch   when banks suddenly  pulled their credit lines   are even  fresher [than the dotcom crash]. A   whole host of companies have since  learnt that they can t necessarily rely   on the banks being there when they  need them and have increased their   own balances accordingly.”2  Bearing all this in mind, and as John  Grout, the ACT s former policy and  technical director, said when asked  about his primary advice for treasurers,  it may be simply that the answer lies in  the old edict:  fund early and fund long”.  The rise of corporate cash balances has  not changed traditional financial theory,  but it does add extra dimensions and  nuances that should be considered on   a case-by-case basis.   • mask poor decision-making on the  part of a manager;  • protect managers  jobs; and  • avoid scrutiny by external lenders    of any  pet projects .  However, given concerns about  availability of finance when needed,  holding cash should reduce the danger   of  costs of financial distress  or having   to dispose of assets at fire sale values.   Returning surplus cash  Another traditional tenet of finance  theory is that if there are no positive NPV  projects available, surplus cash should  be returned to shareholders as holding  cash, especially in the current low or  negative interest rate environment, which  will generate far lower returns than the  company weighted average cost of capital.   However, today the conclusion is not so  clear-cut. Holding cash means that it is  possible to make opportunistic takeover  bids or exploit a major new investment  opportunity. For IT companies,  acquisitions are seen as an essential  means of keeping abreast of changes   in technology and customer preferences.  Indeed, it is said that Google undertakes  an average of one acquisition a week.   To quote Adam Davidson in The New  York Times Magazine:  For a company  such as Google, this means that  investors are behaving as if they trust the  executives in these industries, like Larry  Page of Alphabet, to be smarter about  using that money [ie the cash balances]  than the investors themselves could be.” 1   Berkshire Hathaway s $1bn investment  in Apple earlier this year would appear   MANAGEMENT  1 www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/magazine/why-are- corporations-hoarding-trillions.html?mwrsm=Email   2 www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/11375709/ Apple-might-need-to-save-its-178bn-cash-pile-for-  the-next-rainy-day.html   Paul Cowdell is  associate lecturer   at Sheffield   Hallam University    36  The Treasurer October 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  Clearing and settlement systems around the world are becoming faster,   but research shows that approaches vary.

As Payments Canada moves forward  with its modernisation strategy, the  research looked at how 27 jurisdictions  compared to Canada in their response  to new technologies, evolving user  demands and a changing regulatory  landscape. The research, Clearing and  Settlement Systems from Around the  World: A Qualitative Analysis, compared  timeliness, access, functionality,  interoperability and risk management   in payment systems.   The world is getting faster A major driver for modernisation around  the world is the push for faster retail  payments systems that deliver funds   to the end user in a timely manner.   Most large-value payments systems  (LVPS) around the world have already  developed real-time processing, but   some retail systems are lagging behind.  For example, the decision to implement  the UK s Faster Payments Scheme  (FPS) was made by the government  after a review of the payments system s  inefficiencies, including the need for  faster access. FPS is available day and  night all year to support the demands   of personal and business customers to  move money quickly.  The FPS is an example of an Expedited  Retail Payment System (ERPS), which  provide interbank clearing and are  typically integrated into large-value  systems for settlement. These kinds  of systems are developed, under  construction or planned in 17 of the   27 jurisdictions analysed.  Jurisdictions are also enhancing the  timeliness of their retail batch-processing  systems by adding intraday clearing  and settlement. As a result, all but three  countries (Canada, Egypt and Israel) MOST DATA ARE FROM THE COMMITTEE ON PAYMENTS AND MARKET INFRASTRUCTURES, SEPTEMBER 2015     www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer October 2016 The Treasurer  37  of Canada research. Payment operators  are leveraging centralised architecture to  implement advanced system capabilities.  We found higher functionality in  centralised retail systems, including the  ability to sort, validate, route payment  batches to financial institutions and  interact with other systems. For example,  if the system can scan payments for fraud  and errors, the participants don t have to.   Interoperability Systems are becoming more  interoperable. There is a trend among  the countries studied to move towards  more interoperability between systems,  which enables automation. For example,  TARGET2 in Europe has one of the most  interoperable systems identified in the  research, connecting to 83 ancillary  payment and security systems, and  supporting more than 2,000 direct  participants across 23 jurisdictions.   The research also found that  ISO 20022, a messaging standard,  is becoming the most prominent  international standard for electronic  payment messages. ISO 20022 will help  businesses and financial institutions  move away from paper by creating   the conditions for data-rich electronic  payments. ISO 20022, which can be  found in EU countries, Japan and New  Zealand, can also help streamline cross-  border payments by using a common  language for payments data.   In Canada, the ability to use  rich standardised payments  information will save businesses   time, and our research released   in 2015 on the benefits of ISO 20022  suggests that it could save more than  $4.5bn over five years. Payments Canada  plans to implement ISO 20022 for  its core payment system to improve  interoperability and provide more  services for participants and end users.   Risk management is evolving Risk management processes in retail  systems have evolved to accommodate  interoperable systems, more participants  and faster availability of funds. Risk  management is being addressed  primarily through faster settlement  processes and enhanced collateralisation  use. Large-value systems are seeing more  advanced liquidity-saving tools and real- time monitoring to help mitigate risks.  Payments Canada s Automated Clearing  Settlement System was designated for  oversight by the Bank of Canada in   May, which means it will be subject to  more stringent risk management criteria  going forward.  No  one-size-fits-all  Core payment systems around the world  have significantly evolved since 2005.  Of the 27 countries examined, 24 have  redesigned or added at least one core  payment system. Of these jurisdictions,  20 have made, or are in the process of  making, major changes to more than   one core payment system.   However, there is no one-size-fits- all approach to modernisation. Each  jurisdiction has modernised based on  its own public policy objectives, user  needs and legacy systems. What does  seem clear is that success is enhanced by  taking a holistic, multi-system approach  to modernising core payment systems  that complement each other.   now have at least one ERPS or batch- retail system that provides same-day or  intraday settlement.   To support more timely retail payments,  LVPS hours of operation in some countries  have been extended beyond business  hours. Significant changes to settlement  systems have been made in Australia,  Sweden and the UK to accommodate  faster settlement of retail systems.   Participation A major finding in the research has   been that direct participation in core  systems is widening. Many jurisdictions  have an explicit public policy objective   to increase access for direct participants  in their batch or retail systems and   LVPS. This has resulted in a steady   rise in direct participation, along with   the need to upgrade technology and  improve risk management.   For example, the batch retail system in  New Zealand, with multiple settlements  a day, was established largely to reduce  credit risk to allow international banks  to become direct participants. China  established more than 268 direct  participants in its national automated  clearing house when the China National  Advanced Payments System was  introduced, while managing credit   risk with collateralisation and same-  day settlement.

First and foremost, companies need  to make sure their own processes are as efficient as possible.   Llewelyn Mullooly and Martin Flint explore the issues  In the wake of the Leave vote,  uncertainty abounds. For UK  companies, this uncertainty    has wide-ranging implications     and nowhere is this more evident   than in the area of working   capital management.   Economic uncertainty can affect  working capital management in a  number of ways. For one thing, less  certain market conditions may render  sales forecasts and cash-flow forecasts  inaccurate, leaving companies with a  funding shortfall or with too many assets  on the balance sheet.   Uncertain conditions can also prompt  companies along the supply chain  to adopt greater caution, sometimes  resulting in changes to payment terms  or to the timing of payment to suppliers.  For other companies, particularly  manufacturers, movements in exchange  rates and commodity prices will also  impact working capital, having a   knock-on effect on the cost of raw  materials and inventories.   Impact of the vote Following the financial crisis, many   UK companies focused squarely on  working capital management, and, based  on our analysis undertaken with Markit  Economics, this focus appears to have  remained in place for a number of years.  Positive GDP and more stable economic  and financial conditions in the past   MANAGING   WORKING CAPITAL  UNCERTAIN TIMES  couple of years may, however, have  prompted some companies to shift  some of that focus.  Following the referendum, the  British pound has fallen against   the US dollar by around 12% as    of the beginning of August. For  companies purchasing goods from  overseas suppliers, this type of swing   can have a significant impact on the   cost of raw goods. The Bank of England s  response was to reduce interest rates   by another 25 basis points, while  increasing government and corporate  bond purchases, driving FX rates down  even further.   Equity markets may have rebounded  more recently   but the continuing  uncertainty and mixed economic data  are likely to make working capital  management a challenge for some time  to come. For treasurers, this may be a  good moment to review the company s  working capital management processes.   Best practices Working capital is a resource that  companies need to manage effectively.   Financing working capital comes at   a cost, and in a challenging economic  environment, this can have a direct   impact on the efficiency of assets   and the company s return on capital.   Reducing the amount of working capital  used by the company not only releases  cash into the business for other strategic  objectives, but can also reduce ongoing  financing requirements.   The efficiency of UK companies   working capital practices varies  considerably. Our own research, based   on the publicly available financial data   of around 19,000 companies in the UK,  found that the top 10% of companies in  terms of working capital efficiency had,   on average, twice as much proportional  cash from operations as the bottom 10%.  In an uncertain market, there is a clear  business case for prioritising working  capital management.   Effective working capital management  involves working cross-functionally  within the business and balancing  commercial and financial objectives. For  example, companies have to balance their  need for cash against the importance of  maintaining strong relationships with  their suppliers and customers. They may  also have to consider whether it is better   to prioritise making their own processes  and operations more efficient, or  adopting the financial solutions offered  by banks and others.  Working capital focus While financial solutions can play an  important role in supporting effective  working capital management, the  implementation of those solutions   can be limited by a company s available  management information and existing  business structures and processes   within the organisation. In addition,   a key challenge when optimising   working capital is to ensure that  improvements are embedded within  the organisation and do not adversely   Companies need to ensure that working  capital is a boardroom discussion and   seen as a finance and business priority  in     www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer October 2016 The Treasurer  39  Llewelyn Mullooly (left) and Martin Flint  (right) are directors of working capital,  global transaction banking, at Lloyds Bank  BUILDING WORKING  CAPITAL INSIGHTS  Lloyds Bank has been working with Markit  Economics to create a UK Working Capital  Index through the analysis of macroeconomic  data and business performance indicators.   The objective is to highlight the drivers and  pressures affecting UK working capital cycles,  while supporting UK companies in managing  this critical resource effectively.  The research carried out just before the EU  referendum found that economic uncertainty,  including the UK leaving the EU, was one of   the top five concerns for UK companies when it  comes to working capital management, cited by  19% of respondents. The associated uncertainty  over demand and sales volumes was a concern  for a further 14%.  While it is early days yet, the possible   impact of the Leave vote was illustrated by the  survey, with 20% of respondents saying that  they expected their customers to take longer   to pay them in the coming 12 months.   3.  Robust management information    Simply put, if you can t measure it, you  can t manage it. Banks can play a role  in supporting this exercise. Companies  can work with their banks to analyse  their existing payment and collections  processes, and identify opportunities  for improvement. A good relationship  bank will work with the company to  analyse its data and ask whether those  processes are as efficient as possible.   4.  Financial solutions   Treasurers  should assess the full range of  financial solutions available. In times  of economic uncertainty, treasurers  should take the time to understand  the options available and how they can  be deployed to benefit the company.  Banks will have numerous solutions  available, including supplier financing,  asset invoicing and trade instruments,  as well as cash management solutions  designed to improve companies   payment and collection processes.  Meanwhile, the rise of fintechs has led  to the development of a number of  new technological solutions.  Conclusion While the longer-term impact of the  EU referendum vote remains to be seen,  treasurers should be aware of the likely  effects of the current uncertainty.   In a low-rate environment, companies  may tend to focus less on working capital   because they can manage any shortfalls  through cheap debt. During times of  economic uncertainty, however, there   is a greater need for companies to revisit  their working capital management  strategy. Going into an uncertain  environment, the last thing that any  treasurer wants is to leave untapped   cash in the business. They will therefore  be taking the opportunity to make sure  that working capital is a priority across  the business.   impact margins, increase risk within  the supply chain or damage commercial  relationships or reputations over the   long term.  The cross-functional engagement and  requirement to balance often competing  priorities requires treasurers to think  carefully about how effectively working  capital is being managed within their  organisations. The following are a few key  points to consider in light of the current  economic environment: 1. Proper focus   To be effective,   companies need to ensure that working  capital is a boardroom discussion and  seen as a finance and business priority  throughout the organisation. It should  be incorporated into planning cycles,  agendas, targets, KPIs, investment  cases and scorecards   and should also  be measured, with metrics managed  and shared across the different  functions in the organisation.  2.  Governance frameworks    Clearly defined areas of  accountability are needed for  influencing and working across  functions, as well as regular  forums for review and challenge.  Only then can companies achieve  sustainable improvements.

What actions  should I take in the immediate  term to protect my financials  from further volatility?”   We experienced similar  frantic reactions from the  global treasury community  the morning after the Swiss  National Bank broke the peg to  euro, or when negative interest  rates became a new normal in  the eurozone. These concerns  are also further elevated for  companies that are undergoing  organisational or structural  shifts, such as an initial public  offering (IPO) or M&A.  Across currencies in the  Americas, Asia and Europe,  the past year and a half has  seen more extreme movements  beyond two standard  deviations   movements  that are greater than 95% of  statistically expected outcomes.

ANH NGUYEN EXPLAINS  unprecedented  volatility. From  our experience  of working with  more than 300  corporates globally,  a solid foundation   of objectives and constraints is  the most important compass  to navigate uncharted waters  and devise risk management  decisions. A holistic assessment  across all aspects of risk is then  required if corporates are to  select optimal strategies. Those  will then need periodic reviews  and updates, particularly in  changing environments.  Put objectives first Risk management objectives  need to be specific, well defined  and understood across all   levels of the organisation.   For the majority of companies,  having a hedging strategy in  place allows them to buy time  to react to sudden shifts in  the market with appropriate  business decisions and smooth  FX impact on the financials.   In an ideal world, if a company  had perfect ability to change   its business operations, such   as immediately raising sales  prices or changing suppliers   in response to adverse currency  impacts, the company would  not need to hedge. In reality,  depending on the industry  and competitive dynamics,  few companies are able to pass  currency risk up or down the   value chain immediately. The  timing cushion, within which  the company can be insulated  from these shocks, determines  the length of the company s   risk management horizon   and expectations.  Risk management objectives  can change over time as  the company experiences  organisational shift throughout  its life cycle. Impacts on FX  risk management approaches  due to structural changes  in the organisation can be  overshadowed by impacts   of overnight shifts in external  market conditions. While  market shocks tend to trigger  scrutiny of the company s  hedging strategy by the board  and investors, more attention  should also be paid to how  risk management objectives  and constraints may change  following shifts in corporate  structure, such as an IPO or   a strategic acquisition.   Such events require the  company to reassess its risk  tolerance and the sensitivity of  its stakeholders. For example,   a private company under a  single investor s ownership   may have a more discretionary  view of specific exposures.  Once the company is listed,   risk management objectives  might gravitate towards a  removal of financial volatility,  given the large base of investors  with varying priorities.  Similarly, separate entities   are likely to have different  perception and objectives of  risk management that need   to be discussed and reconciled  upon a merger or acquisition.   Capital structuring   and hedging  Strategic capital structure  selection can be an effective  way to introduce natural  offsets to the company s  overall risk profile. When used  appropriately in conjunction  with operational hedging  programmes, this approach  can provide companies with a  more dynamic risk strategy that  addresses different objectives  and constraints.  An issuance in foreign  debt markets (or a synthetic  foreign debt via the use of  cross-currency swaps) can  create a natural hedge: foreign  interest payable offsets positive  cash flow in that currency  on the profit and loss, while  the liability itself can be a  natural hedge of foreign equity.  Operational hedging, on the  other hand, is the ongoing  hedging of foreign flows  generated by the business,   to remove volatility in specific  financial metrics (for example,  EBITDA, net income or  covenants). Given the multiple  impacts of a single strategy  on a company s results, it is  crucial that every risk strategy  is assessed against specific  and well-defined objectives.   42  The Treasurer October 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer    exposure to stabilise financial  results. A large negative mark- to-market can be emotionally  unnerving; in the wake of  the EU referendum, we had  conversations with companies  that considered unwinding  their forward contracts to  capitalise on the gains, or settle  the losses and put on new  trades at market levels. These  may be discretionary tactics  for cash flows and budgeting  reasons specific to each  company, but might not be  straightforward to implement  for complex tax and accounting  reasons. Moreover, since  hedges were put in place to  protect certain forecasts against  market volatility, there is a  strong case for not removing  this protection at the most  volatile time, unless the nature  of the underlying exposures has  changed significantly due to  this market shock (for example,  a re-forecasting is required). In  this example, long-term risk  management priorities can be  overshadowed by foggy market  environments, and companies  that rely solely on tactical  actions may risk no longer  having a strategic direction.   In light of recent market  shocks, risk management  policies should be reviewed  to validate whether they are  still appropriate and meet set  objectives. It should be assessed  at what cost these objectives are  achieved and whether there are   hedging results when  capital structuring and  operational hedging  decisions lie within  separate teams, or  when there is no holistic  assessment of risk profiles   across these separate functions.  For example, a company  may over-hedge its euro net  cash flows when hedging  forecasted euro EBITDA  without taking into account  the impact of interest expenses  from an existing EUR/GBP  cross-currency swap that  synthetically converts sterling  debt to euro liability.  Policy requires regular  review and maintenance A hedging policy that  efficiently addresses the  company s objectives, priorities  and constraints can be   more resilient in the face   of changing environments.  When confronted with a  sudden market shock, the  company s approach to natural  hedging strategies is less likely  to change significantly.   In the shorter term,  an operational hedging  programme helps insulate the  company from this overnight  shock, as FX rates are already  locked in for the chosen  hedging horizon. That said,  this benefit is achieved via a  sizeable mark-to-market figure,  an asset/liability that offsets the  FX loss/gain of the underlying   For example, a publicly  listed company primarily  focusing on earnings  per share may only reap  marginal benefits from  foreign debt (via its interest  expense netting positive  flows in the same currency),  whereas a company that cares  more deeply about its equity  value (for example, to protect  investors  equity returns) may  consider capital structuring the  most efficient tool.   While capital structuring is  most appropriate as a longer- term risk-mitigation strategy  (for example, three to five  years), given the relatively rigid  structure of debt, operational  hedging can be more dynamic  and adaptable to a changing  profile of exposures over  time. This flexible structure  also means that operational  programmes are designed   to smooth FX impacts over a  shorter horizon (for example,  a fiscal year), rather than  removing risk altogether.  The two approaches, with  their respective pros and cons,  offer limitless alternatives for  designing an optimal policy.  They cannot be designed in  isolation and need to work   in tandem to achieve the   level of risk reduction and  horizon of risk management  defined by the company s  objectives. We have seen  companies experiencing  inefficiencies and unexpected   new objectives and constraints  that need to be addressed.  With changes in corporate  ownership, capital or  organisational structure,  the company s risk policy  should adapt to shifting risk  management objectives. Whereas  FX used to be a more reactive  topic in the larger context of  change management in corporate  finance and treasury, we have  increasingly seen companies  taking a more proactive approach  to FX discussions at the board  and senior management level at  the early stage of an IPO, M&A  or divestiture in anticipation of  shifts in priorities or potential  disconnect in objectives   and constraints.  In the face of changing  environments, we have seen  that the three crucial pillars   for a resilient risk management  strategy are a solid foundation  of objectives and constraints, a  holistic assessment of potential  strategies with both capital  structuring and operational  hedging approaches, and a  discipline of periodic policy  reviews and updates.    www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer October 2016 The Treasurer  43  Anh Nguyen is   manager in risk  management advisory  at Chatham Financial     More than 10,500  treasury professionals  around the world  are looking at this page  Advertise today: CONTACT Tom Fountain  Group Advertising Manager   tel: +44 (0)20 3771 7250   or email:   tom.fountain@thinkpublishing.co.uk  Dan Gallagher  Senior Advertising Executive  tel: +44 (0)20 3771 7244   or email:  dan.gallagher@thinkpublishing.co.uk  Online at:  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  www.treasurers.org/treasuryjobs  The M agazine of The Association of Corporate Treasurers  w w  w .treasurers.org/thetreasurer  The Treasurer O  cto b  er 20 16  THE MAGAZINE OF  THE ASSOCIATION O  F CORPORATE TREA SURERS   OCTOBER 2016  DEALS OF THE YEAR  2016  How to enter this yea r s awards and   secure your place in  the limelight  14-PAGE   SPECIAL   Cash & liquidity management Europe s conversion c  ycle,   payment and settleme nt   trends, and cash mou ntains  www.treasurers.org/ thetreasurer  SKILLS RECOGNISED Microsoft s Rahul Da  swani on   structured finance an d the need    for good communicat ion  LOCATION LOCATION The case for having t  reasury  operations in Hong K ong  THE GLOBAL TAX PRO JECT  International measu res that aim    to level the playing fi eld  PLUS  01 Cover Oct16_v2_gre ybackgroundB.indd   1  23/09/2016   10:46  10  issues a year    in print    regulation and supervision of  insurance companies, while  rating agencies consider various  criteria in order to provide  opinions on the financial  strength of insurers in respect  of their ability to pay claims   to policyholders.   Regulatory capital coverage  ratios and rating agency  opinions are helpful to pension  schemes in assessing the   short-term financial strength   of prospective buy-in and  buyout providers, but what  criteria might those schemes  and their advisers use to form  their own view?  Capital requirements Insurers hold capital to ensure  they can pay policyholders.  Under the current regulatory  capital regime (known as   Solvency II ), insurers are  required to hold capital that   In selecting an insurer,  price is an important  factor for pension   schemes, but it should not   be the only factor. Unlike the  short-term insurance business,  where the consequences of  under-pricing quickly manifest  themselves, the repercussions  for the pension buy-in and  buyout business may not be  realised for many years. This  poses a challenge for pension  schemes that are entrusting an  insurer to meet the obligation  to pay scheme members for   the next 50 or more years.  One of the main benefits  of buy-ins and buyouts is  that the security of members   benefits naturally increases as  they move out of the pension s  framework into regulated  insurance. However, not all  insurance companies have the  same financial strength, and  this should not be overlooked  when selecting an insurer.  In the US, the 1991 insolvency  of Executive Life, a California- based annuity writer, offers an  interesting case study, which  ultimately led to a system  under which pension plans  cannot select insurers that have  not first met independently  assessed  safest available  provider  criteria, irrespective   of the price they can offer.  In the UK, a prudent  regulatory framework exists  to ensure that insurance  companies remain strong, but  no such specific requirement  exists for buyout providers to be  independently assessed against  set criteria. To a large extent,  pension schemes implicitly  rely on rating agencies,  the Prudential Regulatory  Authority (PRA) and any  covenant advice that they  take to assess and ensure the  financial strength of insurers.  The PRA is responsible for the   Financial risk management Governance issues  of the insurer s balance sheet,  are also important indicators.  Balance-sheet quality,  size and diversification Insurers back the pension  promises they take on with  a variety of investments and  must strike a balance between  investing with caution and  sourcing assets that generate  yields sufficient to support  competitive pricing. A large,  established insurer with a  high-quality, well-diversified  investment portfolio may in  some instances charge a higher  premium than those insurers  that operate less diversified  investment portfolios.   Monoline insurers that  focus on a specific product are  exposed to a much narrower  range of risks than multiline  insurers. Pension schemes,  therefore, need to decide  whether a higher premium  represents good value for the  additional security offered.  Long-term value While price will always be  an important consideration,  trustees and sponsoring  companies should also  pay close attention to the  value of the policy they  are buying. The long-term  security of the insurer    demonstrated by a large and  well-diversified balance sheet    is an important, and often  overlooked, point in that   value consideration.

Relationships   and correlations between  currencies, which for a long  time appeared reliable, have  recently shown a tendency to  break down. These breakdowns  usually occur at a time of  general economic stress, and  the fallout is often dramatic.   Recently, the most extreme  example is the EUR/CHF  currency pair. It was floored   at 1.2000 by the Swiss National  Bank (SNB) on 6 September  2011 and the floor was defended  by the SNB selling CHF and  buying EUR (see Figure 1).  However, the SNB did not   sterilise  its intervention in  the markets   ie, it did not sell  government bonds to soak up  the extra supply of CHF.   Although this policy could  have gone on ad infinitum from  a pure currency perspective  (since a central bank can  always turn to the printing  presses and never run out of  its own currency to sell), from  a money-supply perspective,  there were always going  to be limits to the policy s  duration. This is because every  unsterilised Swiss franc that  was printed added to the Swiss  money supply. One of the main  reasons for the intervention  in the first place was to avoid  deflation. However, a spiralling  money supply eventually  unnerved the SNB, and on   15 January 2015, it abandoned  the EUR/CHF floor. This saw  the exchange rate plummet   by some 30% on the day,   and anyone who was relying    ONCE RELIABLE, CURRENCY PAIRS MAY NOT BE A SAFE BET IN THE FUTURE,   AND TREASURERS SHOULD CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY VOLATILITY   ON SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS, JAMES STRETTON ARGUES   on the continuation of the  1.2000 floor was suddenly  completely wrong-footed.  Another currency pair, the  ongoing stability of which it  would be imprudent to rely  on, is EUR/PLN. Indeed, this  may be an accident waiting to  happen. Figure 2 shows the  history of this currency pair  since the euro s inception on   1 January 1999.   The past five years have seen  the rate range bound between  broadly 4.0000 and 4.5000.  Encouraged by Poland s  enthusiastic membership of  the EU, and the recent relative  stability of the exchange rate,  some have been prompted to  regard the PLN as a proxy for  the euro. This could be a very  dangerous notion.   Were one or more eurozone  members to leave, it is not clear  whether the euro would be  stronger or weaker   it would   depend on who left. A euro  without Germany would leave  the single currency as weak as  a kitten. Certainly, EUR/PLN  would be highly unlikely to  remain in the 4.0000 to   4.5000 range.   It is not just reliance on  correlations that can wreak  havoc in corporate treasuries.  Many businesses also have  loose or formal arrangements  with their suppliers or  customers to share in the pain  or gain from substantial FX  movements. Yet, even formal  agreements can be subject   to hasty renegotiation in  difficult times, and loose  agreements have a habit of  disappearing completely.  For example, in the  aftermath of the financial  crisis, suppliers of imported  food products, who had  looked for support from  their supermarket customers   during previous bouts of  sterling weakness, found it  very difficult to push through  price rises. They face the same  problem once again, in that  the fall in GBP/EUR since  the referendum has occurred  against the backdrop of a  sharp fall in general business  confidence. This, combined  with fierce supermarket price  wars, means the supermarket  buyers are in no mood to help  out suppliers by paying more  for imported products.   Currency risk This is the iron law of FX: large  currency movements always  happen for a reason. In many  cases, the underlying cause  of the movement will make  it even more difficult to cope  with, whether it s a financial  crisis or an unanticipated  political event.  Some companies, perhaps  due to a lack of experience,  could make the mistake of  assuming that since they pay  for certain imported inputs in  sterling, they are not exposed  to currency risk. While this  may be convenient in times   of stable exchange rates, in the  event of a decent downward  move of the pound, suppliers  will quickly raise their sterling  prices in order to maintain  their prices in terms of their  own reporting currency. The  pricing of some manufacturing  inputs may be even more  nuanced. For instance, a  manufacturer using oil-based  products from the eurozone  is likely to be exposed to the  dollar, rather than the euro,  since oil is priced in dollars.   As if all of this were not  tricky enough, companies  have to contend with the  competition. Even if a firm  manages to avoid being  lulled into a false sense of  security offered by a particular  consensus view and seeks   to hedge itself in order to  protect against adverse  currency movements, it   must still consider the actions  of its competitors.   46  The Treasurer October 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  IK O  N  IM  A G  ES    Importers trading in  products that have few  substitutes might be assumed  to be in the same boat. In   the case of sterling weakness,  eventually they will all have   to raise prices. Although,   those who have hedged will   be able to hold out for longer  and potentially increase market  share. However, in the case   of sterling strength, the   Alternatively, an exporter  of goods or services may be  competing with domestic  manufacturers in the export  market, who face little or no  FX risk. In this circumstance,  sterling strength, if unhedged,  could prove disastrous, since,  depending on the price  elasticity of demand for the  export, there may be little  ability to pass on currency- induced price increases.  As we have seen from EUR/ CHF and longer-term historical  movements in EUR/PLN,  seemingly stable currency pairs  have the potential to surprise.  And, it can be perilous to rely  on the consensus, as the recent  EU referendum demonstrated.   Attempts to share the pain  or gain of currency movements  with customers or suppliers   are often successful when   the movements are relatively  small and when times are good.  However, when movements  are large, they are often  accompanied by some general  economic malaise for at least  one of the parties.   Some companies may be  able to reprice when input   costs rise or their reporting  currency appreciates. Though  the ability to do this will  depend very much on the  market for the product or  service, and on competition.   For those operating in  competitive markets, neither  currency stability nor  relationships with customers  or suppliers should be  taken for granted. In these  circumstances, the sensible  use of derivatives to create  a flexible hedging strategy  becomes crucial.

Second, Asian corporate  groups are expanding globally  with acquisitions and also  maturing in their operations,  including their treasury  functions. There is a growing  recognition and awareness  among Asian corporate groups,  as they become more global,  of the need to centralise  the treasury function and  the management of cash, to  better manage liquidity and  reduce funding costs across  the corporate group. As these  Asian corporate groups obtain  better visibility over their  cash and debt positions, such  considerations invariably turn  to the centralisation of the  corporate treasury function  into a CTC.   According to a recent EY  survey of corporate treasurers  on global and regional  operating models and  location selection for CTCs in  Asia-Pacific, key factors that  corporate groups look into  on CTC location selection  typically include: • sophistication of    financial infrastructure;  • access to capital markets;  • cost and availability of   treasury talent;  • overall tax environment; • legal and regulatory   environment; and • political stability.   For CTCs actively managing  the treasury position (as  distinct from service-centre- type CTCs performing, for  example, payment processing),  aspects such as the legal and  regulatory environment,  access to capital markets and   Hong Kong has  introduced recent law  changes to address the   asymmetrical tax treatment   of interest income and expense  that previously had made it  less favourable for regional  corporate treasury centres  (CTCs). It has also added a  half-rate tax incentive with a  view to attracting more global  and regional CTCs.   Hong Kong is well  positioned for corporate groups  (both Western multinational  corporations (MNCs) and  Asian outbounds) to centralise  their global and regional  treasury functions because  of its proximity to mainland  China, the largest offshore  renminbi pool, well-developed  banking system, efficient  capital and FX markets, deep  talent pool of experienced  treasury, banking and asset  management personnel,  favourable regulatory and   tax regime, and sound  common law legal system.   The recent tax law changes  will make Hong Kong more  competitive when global and  Asian MNCs look for a location  to set up a corporate treasury  centre in the Asian time zone,”  says Vincent Lee, executive  director of the Hong Kong  Monetary Authority.  There are two key drivers  behind the interest in Asia as  a base for CTCs. First, the size  and scale of Western MNCs  in the region have continued  to increase as the balance of  economic power shifts towards  Asia and other emerging  markets.  The increased scale  of Western MNCs in Asia is  resulting in an increased need  for the active management  of treasury during the Asian  time zone and to be closer to  the markets to better deal with  some of the regulatory and   Hong Kong is one of the most competitive  economies worldwide, according to    the IMD Competitiveness Center  availability of treasury talent  are generally assumed to be  a given for a location to be  seriously considered for setting  up a CTC.   Why Hong Kong? Without doubt, Hong Kong  has its strengths. It ranks as  the world s most competitive  economy in the IMD World  Competitiveness Yearbook 2016,  moving up from second place  in 2015. It also places third  globally behind Switzerland  and Luxembourg and first in  Asia in terms of availability of  financial services in the World  Economic Forum s Global  Competitive Report 2015-2016.  Hong Kong has high standards  of market transparency,  disclosure, prudent supervision  and is without exchange  controls, all crucial for  centralised treasury functions.1    While we are seeing a lot  of interest in Shanghai for  treasury centres focused on  managing the treasury position  in China, and an onshore  cash pool for renminbi, for a  regional or global CTC in Asia,  the choice invariably comes  down to Singapore and Hong  Kong,” according to E-May  Neoh, Asia head of liquidity  management, Bank of America  Merrill Lynch.  The location of  choice is then decided around  a corporate group s current  geographic footprint and  regional headquarters location,  together with economic  factors, such as taxation.”  Hong Kong is one of the  most competitive economies  worldwide, according to the  IMD World Competitiveness  Center, and is already a leading  destination for regional and  international headquarters  and CTCs. Based on the  Report on 2015 Annual Survey  of Companies in Hong  Kong Representing Parent  Companies Located outside  Hong Kong, the number of  regional headquarters, regional  offices and local offices in  Hong Kong rose from 6,948     www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer October 2016 The Treasurer  49  SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K    50  The Treasurer October 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  James Badenach is a  partner and international  tax services leader    financial services at   EY Hong Kong  The views reflected in this article are the  views of the author and do not necessarily  reflect the views of the global EY  organisation or its member firms.   1 Asia Treasury Trailblazer Summit   2015, Hong Kong Monetary Authority,   30 April 2015 (www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/ key-information/speech-speakers/ pstpang/20150430-1.shtml) 2 Published by the Census and Statistics  Department Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region (www.statistics.gov. hk/pub/B11100042015AN15B0100.pdf) 3 Hong Kong: The Facts (www.gov.hk/en/ about/abouthk/factsheets/docs/ financial_services.pdf)  in 2011 to 7,904 in 2015.2 Of  these, there is a steady growing  rate of set-ups with parent  companies located in China.   Hong Kong made its  intention clear in the 2014  budget of attracting more  CTCs to Hong Kong to enhance  its position as a leading  global international financial  centre, a leading offshore  renminbi centre, a premier  asset management hub and an  international capital market.  The Hong Kong government  followed through with the  passing of legislation that  addressed the tax asymmetry  issue in the Hong Kong  domestic tax law and also  legislated a tax rate incentive  of 8.25%.   The asymmetry issue  previously arose where interest  expenses paid to overseas  non-financial institutions  prior to the law changes were  not tax-deductible in Hong  Kong for a CTC carrying on  the business of lending of  money in Hong Kong, while  at the same time the interest  income from overseas lending  was chargeable to tax in Hong  Kong.  The law has now been  changed to address this issue,  albeit with certain conditions,”  says Alice Chan, partner and  international tax services  leader at EY Hong Kong.  Our  clients are now viewing Hong  Kong in a different light in any  analysis on location selection  for their regional or global  CTCs. Now Hong Kong is  being seriously considered,  which bodes well for Hong  Kong, given its geographic  advantage of being proximate  to mainland China.”   In addition, Hong Kong  has legislated for a tax rate  incentive of 50% of the current  profits tax rate (ie 8.25%) for  qualifying CTCs in respect of  a broad range of prescribed  corporate treasury services  and transactions. The tax rate  incentive is relatively wide in  terms of the activities that fall  within the incentive, however,   to obtain the incentive may  require CTCs to set up in a  separate legal entity to conduct  the treasury activities.   For regional or global CTCs  in Asia-Pacific, Hong Kong  and Singapore are generally  the preferred locations, and  there has been a healthy  rivalry between them as  global financial centres, with  both possessing the relevant  attributes for corporate  treasurers. Both locations  are well positioned as CTC  hubs in terms of financial  infrastructure, efficient FX  market, availability of treasury  talents, and sound regulatory  and legal framework. Hong  Kong has a comparative  advantage in its role as a  premier offshore renminbi  centre and, having close ties  with China, better established  equity capital market as well  as a more extensive network  of international corporate and  investment banks.   Under the three-tier banking  system, Hong Kong has a  highly developed banking  market, with approximately  70% of the top 100 banks in  the world having operations in  Hong Kong. Being one of the  most active markets for initial   public offerings, Hong Kong s  stock market was the fifth- largest in the world and the  third-largest in Asia in terms of  market capitalisation as at the  end of April 2015. In addition,  Hong Kong s debt market is  one of the most liquid markets  in Asia. By the end of April  2015, the outstanding amount  of the Exchange Fund Bills and  Notes was about HK$752.8bn,  with a daily turnover averaged  at HK$12.6bn.3  Tax treaties In contrast, Singapore is  often perceived as better in  terms of geographic proximity  to ASEAN countries, the  availability and quality of  treasury talent, a long-standing  specific tax incentive for  treasury centres (among other  favourable tax incentives,  including those in the financial  services space) and a well- developed commodities  market. Singapore also has a  larger tax treaty network than  Hong Kong in terms of the  number of treaties. However, as  a result of Hong Kong s active  effort to expand its tax treaty  network, Hong Kong now   has a number of tax treaties  offering a more favourable  interest withholding tax rate  than Singapore. Specifically  on the CTC regimes in both  locations, the new CTC  incentive enacted by Hong  Kong does leave little arbitrage  between the two locations  from a tax rate perspective.  Nevertheless, tax should  never be the sole consideration  in choosing the location of  a CTC. The location should   depend on the footprint and  business needs of the corporate  group and the physical location  of the corporate treasury  team actively managing the  corporate group s treasury, and  related treasury and financial  risks. Going forward, as a direct  result of changes happening  globally to the international  tax system through the  Organisation for Economic   Co-operation and  Development s Base Erosion  and Profit Shifting project,   aligning the location of the  treasury team and the location  where transactions are booked  will be crucial for any MNC  looking to access reduced rates  of interest withholding tax  under tax treaties, for example,  and to manage its transfer  pricing risk”, says Eng Ping   Yeo, EY ASEAN tax leader.  For corporate groups that  focus solely on the ASEAN  region, Singapore may offer   a slight competitive advantage  given its geographic proximity;  for those corporate groups  that have material business  activities with or in mainland  China and the rest of  northeastern Asia, Hong Kong  has a distinctive geographic  advantage over Singapore. For  mainland Chinese enterprises,  Hong Kong is unquestionably  the natural outbound gate.

MARTIN BELLIN PROPOSES A NEW MODEL  Treasury operations Technology  only large multinationals, but  increasingly also for smaller  companies. Nearly everyone   is active on a global level these  days, and treasurers the world  over are forced to stay abreast  of any economic and political  developments. They need to  think ahead, but at the same  time be able to act on the spot  if need be. They re the ones  managing liquidity; they re   the ones hedging risk; and,   as such, they re key players  in any business. It should  therefore be any company s  top priority to make sure  treasurers have what they need  to meet the challenges of their  profession and the increased  demands globalisation has  placed on them.  and automating processes;  reducing and doing away with  manual processes; and boosting  efficiency. Treasurers want to  be freed of repetitive, tedious  manual jobs, such as gathering  data from subsidiaries. They  want to focus on decisions that  bring real value to the company  and their implementation.   Digitisation has made things  faster, and the world feels  smaller as a result. A seemingly  inconsequential event anywhere  in the world can have huge  repercussions for businesses     and this is no longer true for   No one-size-fits-all way   to strategic treasury So how can we best support  treasurers in their work? It is  important to remember that  every business is different  and that there may be more  than one way of achieving this  ultimate objective of treasury:  underpinning a company s  every financial move and  ensuring a sound strategy   that safeguards liquidity  and boosts profitability    weathering any political or  economic turbulences.   Software as a service (SaaS)  has made the lives of treasurers  much easier: cloud-based  systems have allowed them  access to group-wide data at the  touch of a button, in real time,  regardless of their location.  This has brought a considerable  reduction of treasurers   workloads. Nevertheless, there  is a powerful trend towards   Treasury management  without the use of  professional tools to   underpin treasury processes  seems more and more  unthinkable in a modern,  technology-driven world.

Let s build on the  achievements SaaS technology  has brought us and take the  next step. Let s embrace the  service component of treasury,  and listen to what corporate  treasurers really need.   by someone else who is  familiar with the system and  understands treasury processes.  While using a TMS does  make life that much easier, it   is still an application treasurers  need to spend time on. It  requires implementation,  training and maintenance.  For some treasurers, it  might indeed be time to ask  themselves: am I really running  my treasury, or am I running  my treasury system? Am   I putting the data in my TMS to  optimum use? What if I could  boil things down to the point  where I am left with strategic  decision-making as my only  real  task ?   We ve already mentioned the  important role of treasurers for  sensitive and crucial financial  issues: where is excess liquidity  tied up that could be used  elsewhere? Which investments  are needed and who needs an  intercompany loan? Which  risks need to be hedged? Or,  to put it in even more practical  terms, how do I ensure my  company is unaffected by any  potential repercussions that  Brexit might bring? Treasurers  need to be enabled to stay   on top of these decisions, to  have complete visibility and  to use their overview to their  strategic advantage.  It s the results that count Treasurers need data and  results. They may also want  the application, but they may  also not. Let s put this in non- treasury terms: who today is  still willing to pay for an app  on their smartphone? Hardly  anyone. It is more or less  taken for granted that apps   are provided for free. Now,  the actual data, the results,  are a very different matter.  Yes, we might be willing to  pay someone for providing  us with the information we  need to take further action.  If someone presents me with  the complete results, all neatly  prepared and geared towards  my requirements, and all I need  to do is say yes or no   that  represents a service that really  makes my life easier and that  has real value for me.  The specific treasury  services a company might  require depend very much on  size and strategy. There are a  number of non-mission critical  and non-core competence  processes in treasury. In theory,  TaaS can cover any corporate  treasury operation and can be  made to fit any functionality  required. It is all a question of  capacity, focus and, ultimately,  preference. As a company, you  might have certain tedious,  recurring treasury processes  that you simply don t want your  treasury staff spending their  time on and allocating their  resources to. Or you might have  more complex requirements  that would mean having to   buy in outside expertise. Or you  may not even have a treasury in  the first place.   TaaS can support any role   in a corporate s front, middle or  back office, including operative  maintenance of master data;  regular system-data verification  and maintenance; account  statement collection and  verification; daily financial  status reporting; automation  control and error resolution;  monitoring liquidity   even more automation, and  even more focus on the way  a corporate treasury adds  strategic value to a business.  Even with considerable  automation by means of a  treasury management system  (TMS), companies might still  be left with daily tasks that  exceed their capacities. Or  they may simply choose to  focus their energies even more  on what they can do with the  results a treasury application  provides. Whether you have a  treasury set up, but would like  to spend your time differently;  or whether you don t have a  treasury, but would still like to  benefit from the added value  treasury data and management  can bring, the key to both can  be outsourcing   via Treasury  as a Service (TaaS). Echoing  SaaS, TaaS goes beyond mere  technical support. It aims  to meet the very objective  of modern treasury even  more pointedly: eliminating  inefficient and repetitive tasks  that can easily be performed      54  The Treasurer October 2016 www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer  exhibited by underperforming  teams. These characteristics are  linked and build from one to  another, leading ultimately to  the potential of team failure.  So, what makes a team   go wrong?  Characteristic 1:   Absence of trust Typically, teams that have low  trust levels come about as a  result of team members not  being prepared to be vulnerable  with one another. This will  often manifest itself in people  hiding mistakes, not admitting  their weaknesses and generally  not asking for help.  Characteristic 2:   Fear of conflict When team members do not  trust each other, this can often  lead to members staying quiet  when they disagree, or withhold  ideas and contributions that  otherwise could benefit creative  behaviour. The reason for  staying quiet is that it is easier  than starting conflicts with  colleagues. Often, cliques will  form and conversations are had   Behavioural skills Working effectively with others  Those that can, share EFFECTIVE, FOCUSED TEAMS HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND A WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE WITH EACH  OTHER AT THEIR CORE. VANESSA HARWOOD-WHITCHER EXPLAINS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF   HIGH-PERFORMANCE TEAMS AND SHOWS HOW TO SPOT THE SIGNS OF LESS-EFFECTIVE ONES   Take a small, eclectic group of friends, mix together with some great  minds, a garage and a big  ambition to change the nature  of computing and what do you  get? The answer, of course, was  the birth of the Apple Mac, the  fastest-selling machine that  beat any PC created before it.  The story of the now  infamous Steve Jobs and Steve  Wozniak is widely known,  and while one may not think  that the most people-friendly  leadership skills could be  found at Apple, the story   is worth examining in more  detail when it comes to its  team approach.  The brilliant minds that  formed the Mac team were  incredibly competitive within  Apple and externally, with their  ambition to beat the other PCs  on the market at the time. The  team and its leader, Steve Jobs,  were single-minded in their focus  to create an affordable PC that  could be used by non-techies.  This relentless focus on  creating the Mac often led to  the most stretching goals and  deadlines being set, and stories  prevail of the caffeine-fuelled,  break-free days and nights  spent building the prototype.  Of course, this often led to  those creative minds having  bust-ups and fallouts, some   of which were told to dramatic  effect in the film Steve Jobs.  Spotting a high- performing team Thinking about one s own  experience of leading or  working within a team, it is  worth taking a few moments  to consider what made that  team a success or failure. There  are often signs that a manager  can spot to help them gauge  the health of the team they  are working in. The diagram  below gives some checkpoints  for leaders to use to see where  their team is strong, and areas  on which they can help their  team to develop.  SIGNS OF A HEALTHY TEAM  Looking back at the Apple  example of a team, a few clues  start to unravel why a seemingly  unorthodox group of people  had such success, including:  focus, clarity, productivity,  stretch and feedback.  What makes a team   go wrong? Of course, the Apple team  wasn t perfect, as the film  depicts. Spotting the signs of   an underperforming team can  be really helpful to managers.   Author Patrick Lencioni  wrote a book called The Five  Dysfunctions of a Team.  The first half of the book  introduces the reader to a  fictitious management team  and the journey of its members  together, and the second half  discusses the key reasons for  team failure. It is an excellent  read and recommended for  anyone working within or  leading a team.   Lencioni explains that there  are a number of dysfunctions   WHAT MAKES A   TEAM GO WRONG?

Their  organisations are usually a  source of standards, which  many will recognise in   the shape of values/goals,  KPIs and defined internal  behaviours. Other places   to look for standards are  through competitors or  industry benchmarks.  The ACT has developed its  own benchmark competency  framework, which defines  the skills and competencies a  treasurer needs no matter what  stage of their career. Developed  after extensive consultation  within the profession, it sets  the standards for not only  the technical treasury skills  needed, but also the business  and behavioural skills, too.  In order to be a rounded  leader within treasury, the  ACT suggests that treasurers  must be slick operators when  it comes to influencing and  working with others effectively.  These skills, of course, are  critical when applied to the  need for leaders to drive the  performance of their teams  and overcome the barriers  highlighted above.  To this end, learners on the  ACT s Diploma in Treasury  Management qualification,  which leads to AMCT member  status, are now required to   and leaders need to be aware  of the impact they themselves  have on creating the right  environment for all team  members to: • deal with trust issues; • value conflict; • encourage commitment; • promote accountability; and •   celebrate results when the   team achieves something.  Setting standards   and benchmarking  By setting standards, a  leader can perform their  role in overcoming barriers  to high performance. Clear  performance standards start  to tackle issues around trust,  communication, commitment  and results. Standards are  important because: • they give clarity of purpose; •  they shape the way things   need to be done culturally; • leaders can be explicit    about the performance  expected, leading to  improved productivity;  • leaders can reward excellent  performance, as once the  standard is reached, a result  can be recognised; and  • leaders can identify  development needs helping  self-awareness, confidence  and stretch.  The ACT suggests that treasurers  must be slick operators  R EX   F EA  TU R  ES  The Apple team in   the film Steve Jobs  complete a new unit called  The Treasury Manager.

This checks more than 80  competencies from the ACT s  competency framework and   can offer managers a real insight  into both themselves and their  team s effectiveness.  Back to Apple Looking for some of the signs   of performance in your own   team and striving to improve  them can only help build   success. With Apple s charismatic  leader and team focus, business  performance naturally followed.  In Steve Jobs  own words:  Great  things in business are never done  by one person; they re done by a  team of people.”   behind closed doors rather  than airing issues as a group.  Characteristic 3:   Lack of commitment When there is no conflict,   it is difficult to get issues and  ideas out in the open and  debate them properly. This  means when an idea does gain  traction among some team  members, if it has not been  debated and buy-in gained,  the team will ultimately not  commit to the decision or  action. This can have a knock- on effect of not having clear  and agreed goals, which can  lead to ambiguity and lack   of focus.  Characteristic 4:   Avoidance of accountability When teams are not  committed to the objective  or goal, it is unlikely that the  individuals within them will  take full accountability for the  team s actions. Even the most  dedicated employee would find  it difficult to hold others to  account if they do not believe  in the cause.  Characteristic 5:   Inattention to results If people aren t committed  or held to account, personal  agendas can start to distract   the team and members  eyes  are taken off the ball. This   can lead to goals being missed   and results not achieved,  which, in turn, can affect  commitment and motivation.   Overcoming barriers   to high performance So what can managers or   team members do to move  away from underachievement  and change to a productive,  high-performing team? There  may be no  I  in team, but   there is a  me .

Work to the nearest €k  (thousand euro).  Certificate in International Cash Management,    simplified extract  Trade-off These interest rates are higher in dollars  than in euro. So investing in dollars will  clearly provide more interest income.   However, the different exchange rates for  swapping currencies, and then swapping  back again, work against us. This hits us  with an offsetting FX loss.  WEIGHING UP FINANCIAL COSTS AND BENEFITS CAN BE DAUNTING.   DOUG WILLIAMSON SHARES A SIMPLE TOOL TO SORT OUT THE NUMBERS  SH U  TT ER  ST O  C K  POWERS OF CONCENTRATION   As corporate treasurers, we can often improve interest income by switching temporary cash surpluses between  different currencies, using an FX swap.  This is an example of cash concentration.  Given the obvious benefits, why don t  treasurers do that all the time?  FX differences An FX swap will produce FX differences,  and potentially FX losses. These FX losses  can wipe out any interest benefits.  Weighing up the costs and benefits can  be tricky, but a simple  With vs Without   technique will keep our thinking clear.  We ll apply this technique to a practical  case, derived from a recent exam question.  Dollar attractions TSA, based in Paris, has a temporary cash  surplus of EUR 8 million for 180 days. TSA  has a US subsidiary, which has a surplus  of USD 5 million, also for 180 days. Rates  available locally to TSA and to its US  subsidiary are set out below.  180-day deposits, per annum: EUR: 0.05% USD 5 million: 0.224%   It s useful to understand this trade-off,   but we don t necessarily need to calculate  the offsetting items separately.   Keep it simple A simpler plan is to compare the net cash   at maturity under each alternative.   This will show the net benefit, or   the net loss, from undertaking the   deal. We ll calculate the terminal cash   in euros: • With concentration in dollars using   the FX swap, leaving the US subsidiary  in the same position as if it had acted  independently; and  • Without concentration, investing the   euro locally in Paris.  Difference = benefit or loss The difference between  With  and    Without  will be the net benefit, or   the net loss.  With X - (Without) (X)  = Benefit/(loss) X/(X)  Business skills Qualifications    With concentration The concentration in US dollars, with an FX  swap, needs four steps: (1) Swap €8m into dollars. (2) Interest on the combined dollars deposit. (3) US subsidiary s independent position. (4) Swap back the balance of dollars  into euro.  With c With concentration $k Steps  €8m swapped   + Subsidiary s own funds  = Combined $ deposit   + Interest added  = Maturing deposit  (Retained by subsidiary)  10,000  5,000  15,000  18  15,018  (5,006)  (1)  (2)  (3)  $k to swap back 10,012 (4)  (1) Swap €8m into dollars The near leg exchange rate is USD/EUR  0.8000. We re calculating to the base  currency USD. So divide the variable  currency €8,000k by this rate: 8,000k/0.8000 = $10,000k  (2) Interest on combined dollar deposit $15,000k x 0.24% x 180/360 = $18k  (3) If US subsidiary had acted  independently Dollar interest income, to the nearest $k: $5,000k x 0.224% x 180/360 = $6k  Independent cash at end: $5,000k + $6k = $5,006k  The US subsidiary must be left in the same  final position as if it had acted independently.  So this amount is retained in the US.  (4) Swap back into euro Far leg exchange rate, USD/EUR, deducting  the 180-day points of 6 (= 0.0006): 0.8000   0.0006 = 0.7994  We re calculating from the base currency  USD. So multiply the base currency $10,012k  by the far leg rate:  Doug Williamson is a  treasury and finance coach  10,012 x 0.7994 = €8,004k  This is the cash in euro at maturity,  With   the FX swap and concentration. Now we  need to compare that result against the   Without  independent alternative.  Without concentration, investing  €8m in Paris Euro interest income without an FX swap,  instead investing directly in Paris: €8,000k x 0.05% x 180/360 = €2k  Cash at end: 8,000 + 2  = €8,002k  Net benefit  €k  With concentration  Without: independent  8,004  (8,002)  Benefit 2  TSA is better off by €2k, with the   temporary concentration in US dollars.   The dollar position of the US subsidiary   is identical under both alternatives.   So it s beneficial to undertake the  temporary concentration in dollars, on   the basis of this comparison.  Other factors In practice, we need to take account of a  number of other important issues, including: • Administrative time; • Bank fees and charges; •  Any uncertainty in the cash-flow    forecasts in each currency; and • Counterparty risks.  These may change our decision.   Different rates If the exchange rates were different, the  net benefit of €2k we calculated previously  might become greater, smaller or even a   net loss. Try recalculating the results with  180-day points of 9 deducted, rather than 6. All other information remains the same.  What s changed? Steps (1) to (3) are unchanged. The only  difference is the re-exchange of dollars into  euro, in our final step (4).  The far leg exchange rate will become: 0.8000   0.0009 = 0.7991  The EUR proceeds from swapping back  $10,012k are now: 10,012 x 0.7991 = €8,001k  Worse off The overall comparison becomes:   €k  With concentration  Without: independent  8,001  (8,002)  Loss (1)  Now we re worse off with the temporary  concentration, by €1k.  How did that happen? The reason we re worse off is that FX loss  has increased. The FX loss now exceeds the  interest benefit, by €1k.   With these exchange rates, it would be  loss-making to undertake the temporary  cash concentration. So we wouldn t do it on  the basis of these exchange rates. We should  either decline the opportunity, or negotiate  for better rates.  www.treasurers.org/thetreasurer October 2016 The Treasurer  57  HELP FOR   ACT STUDENTS  Download further useful study  information from the student site   you are assigned to: either the  Resources area of the ACT Learning  Academy at learning.treasurers.org  or the Exam Tips area of the ACT  Study Site at study.treasurers.org    The 110km   regulatory hurdles The traditional hurdles   race is extended from  110m to 110km. The height  of the hurdles varies, as  does the spacing between  them. Moreover, during the  course of the race, hurdles  are moved, repositioned,  heightened, shortened  and (very rarely) removed  altogether, with little or no  warning. Each hurdle has   its own particular set of rules,  which treasury athletes must  read before attempting to leap  over them. At the conclusion  of the race, the whole thing  starts all over again.
