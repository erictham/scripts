The event included entities from the public and private sectors that have collaborated with the centre for the past three years on achieving the strategy’s objectives, and developing programmes and initiatives under the seven pillars of Islamic economy. Commenting on the workshop, Sultan bin Saeed Al Mansoori, Chairman of DIEDC’s Board, stressed that the strategy has progressed in leaps and bounds on all levels. Among the most notable achievements, he highlighted raising investors’ and entrepreneurs’ awareness on the importance of adopting values that ensure comprehensive and sustainable development. He also mentioned that the next phase requires all the centre’s strategic partners to cooperate in protecting the achievements of the strategy and enhancing the capabilities that are available. 'This will allow us to achieve greater growth across the seven pillars that have proven their ability to drive social and economic development in the years to come,' he noted. During the workshop, DIEDC presented all the centre’s accomplishments since His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, launched the strategy in 2013. The participants also identified strategic gaps in achieving the objectives, and compiled a prioritised list of new and revised initiatives to keep up the momentum achieved to date. Additionally, several brainstorming sessions were held among the entities within the same sectors. In line with the recent growing interest in the Islamic economy framework and its sectors, the stakeholders identified ways to encourage the design of innovative Islamic tools and products that meet the requirements of the market and investors in the public and private sectors. In conclusion, the DIEDC and its partners formulated directives that will lead to an execution plan for the next phase of the strategy, focusing on innovation, knowledge, collaboration, and sustainability. Al Mansoori emphasised that the world today is facing more and more challenges, saying, 'Countries as well as social and economic institutions need to collaborate and build more strategic partnerships that help ensure socio-environmental and food security as these are the foundations of development that should drive all investment and economic activities.' 'With its ethics and noble goals, the Islamic economy system has undoubtedly awakened the interest of traditional economy institutions in investing responsibly in genuine sectors. Seeking to boost the UAE’s status on the global sustainable investment landscape, we are keen to overcome any obstacles that may hinder partnerships between traditional and Islamic economy sectors,' he added. Sami Al Qamzi, Director-General of the Department of Economic Development and Vice -Chairman of DIEDC, said, 'We are proud of the achievements to date, which have resulted in a growing global interest in the Islamic economy sectors. Our success is possible thanks to the directives of our wise leadership, their support for economic development, and their long-term vision for the future needs of the world.'' 'We commend the partners on their efforts and effective contributions towards laying the foundations for the growth of strategic sectors, as well as their quest in enhancing the infrastructure that boosts the UAE and Dubai’s position on the global economic map. Such workshops hold immense significance in gathering all relevant parties, and have them share their outlooks on the future of the Islamic economy. We are confident that the outcomes of the workshop are anticipated to contribute to the general framework of plans until 2021 while determining the forthcoming objectives of the ‘Dubai: Capital of Islamic Economy’ strategy – all of which will be announced in early 2017,'' he indicated. Essa Kazim, Secretary General of DIEDC, said, 'The UAE, and specifically Dubai, has become an eminent economic powerhouse on a regional and international scale. The emirate also boasts a credible and attractive international financial centre as well as plans to improve the regulatory and legislative infrastructure in order to attract investments to the dynamic non-oil sectors. The importance of Islamic economy in finding sustainable solutions to global social and economic challenges is growing.' He emphasised that the status of Islamic economy is limited only by the degree of innovation in its sectors, especially finance, as financial institutions have great influence on the success of individual and corporate investments. With regard to managing Islamic economy sectors, he underlined the importance of depending on data, which plays a significant role in competing with other sectors, developing an outline of the economic system, and finding new ways of governing its institutions. Abdulla Mohammed Al Awar, CEO of DIEDC, began the proceedings of the workshop with a word of gratitude to all entities that contributed to the realization of the objectives of Dubai: The Capital of Islamic Economy indicating that new mechanisms need to be created to strengthen a culture of responsibility in halal investments, finance, industry, manufacturing, and trade, in addition to enhancing the global presence of Islamic economy by expanding towards developing markets. Another pressing need is encouraging Islamic finance institutions to adopt micro-financing in support of SMEs, which are key to social and economic development in emerging markets. © Copyright Emirates News Agency (WAM) 2016. © Copyright Zawya.

The introduction of this sophisticated abra, which is being deployed at Al Mamzar, follows several trial runs to verify the possibility of changing speed. The scheme is part of Dubai Government’s initiative billed: Green Economy for a Sustainable Environment. Abdullah Yousef Al Ali, CEO of RTA Public Transport Agency, said, “This abra is the first public marine transit mode powered by solar energy in the Middle East. The project was intended to convert an abra powered by electricity into an abra powered by solar energy through fitting the roof of the abra with solar panels along with other operational accessories. “A specialist company has conducted a Balance Test during a one-month trial run of the abra at Al Jaddaf with no riders onboard. It was established that the solar power system would have no negative impact on the stability and balance of the hull of the abra, and accordingly, there would be no need for tinkering with the design or specifications of the existing abra or even building new ones. Results have shown that the solar system can charge the battery up to 100percent every day, the stored power would be good enough to drive the abra for five hours at the normal operating speed of 3-4 knots, and the residual power in the battery would be around 25percent. The system requires about six daytime hours to recharge the battery in full,” explained Al Ali. “The launch of this abra is part of RTA strategy towards fully adopting the Green Economy concept and using clean energy in various public transit means. The RTA is focused on turning these concepts into reality through creative initiatives for curbing carbon footprint, and using alternative energy in mass transit means,” added the CEO of RTA Public Transport Agency.

The trade mission aimed to familiarise the Chamber with commercial opportunities in Russia’s second largest city, and showcase the benefits of trading with Dubai, in addition to its strategic position that provides easy access to growth markets in Africa and Asia. During the three-day mission, the Dubai Chamber delegation met with several representatives of the city’s public and private sectors, including the St. Petersburg Chamber of Commerce, the Economic Development Agency of the Leningrad region, a number of multinational companies, as well as other leading local and international chambers of commerce. Joining the delegation were Mr. Omar Khan, Director of International Offices at Dubai Chamber, and Mr. Sanan Nasibli, Head of the Chamber’s representative office in Azerbaijan, who highlighted Dubai’s strong trade relationship with Russia that contributes to various sectors of the emirate’s economy.  “Dubai remains an attractive market for Russian businesses, investors and tourists. Yet, there is still huge potential to expand our ties in key industries, including hospitality, tourism, agriculture, and pharmaceuticals, especially given the country’s aims to diversify its exports,” said Mr. Khan. Advertisement During the meetings, the Chamber explored several areas of mutual cooperation and highlighted the active role it plays in helping foreign companies expand their reach to the GCC region through Dubai. In addition, the Chamber highlighted trade and investment opportunities that are being created by the Dubai Industrial Strategy 2030, which aims to elevate the emirate into a global hub for knowledge-based, sustainable and innovation-focused businesses. The delegation was also informed about new measures and strategies being taken by the Russian government and semi-government entities to help boost trade and investment. “The Chamber’s engagement with stakeholders in the country is crucial as it provides its members access to fresh market intelligence and opportunities that are not immediately apparent at the macro-level. The Chamber’s representative office in Baku serves as a gateway for UAE investment into Russia and the wider CIS region.” He added that the Chamber is now looking at investment opportunities which have become more attractive following the challenging economic conditions faced by Russia, as well as the recent devaluation of its currency. Dubai’s non-oil trade with Russia reached AED 6.7 billion ($1.8 billion) in 2015, marking a 25percent increase compared to 2011. In terms of total value, pearls and semi-precious stones dominated the list of products traded between the emirate and Russia last year, followed by base metals and machinery and electrical equipment. -Ends- About Established in 1965, the Dubai Chamber of Commerce  and  Industry is a non-profit public entity, whose mission is to represent, support and protect the interests of the business community in Dubai by creating a favourable business environment, supporting the development of business, and by promoting Dubai as an international business hub.

Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) will open the AED 150m ($40.8m) bridge leading to local developer Nakheel’s Deira Islands project next Friday. 'The project undertaken by RTA, in conjunction with Nakheel, included the construction of a temporary entrance to Deira Islands and the opening of the Water Canal for navigation. Nakheel has started infrastructure work for islands and maritime structures by completing the entrance of the western bridge and linking it with Al Khaleej Road in the direction of the new ship harbour and fish market, along the stretch of Abu Baker Al Siddique Road starting from the R/A at the intersection with Al Khaleej Road,'' said Mattar Al Tayer, Director-General and Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors of RTA. The project also included opening the navigational lane beneath the bridge by removing some two million cubic meters of sand in three landfill areas. Works also included extending the existing canal walls up to the new fish market marina, in addition to lighting works, sewage, asphalt, shifting and protecting the existing services, and extending services along the bridges. Following the opening of the bridge, the project contractor will remove the last landfill area, and complete work to open the navigational canal. Deira Islands project, developed by Nakheel, is the new waterfront of Dubai. It comprises four man-made islands inside the Arabian Gulf waters along the stretch of Deira Beach spanning an area of about 17 million square meters. The project, which is the largest development project in Deira, includes the construction of hundreds of hotels, hotel apartments, multi-use buildings and marinas. The project is expected to be inhabited by 250,000 persons and provide employment for 80,000 people. According to traffic studies, the volume of traffic generated by the project is expected to reach 110,000 journeys during peak hours, which requires the construction of a massive network of roads and transit systems. There will be three main entrances to the project, two at the intersection of Al Khaleej Road with Abu Baker Al Siddique Road and Al Quds Road, and the third extends from Al Mina Road alongside Rashid Port. The project provides direct and free entrances through flyovers leading to all of the project’s entrances. Advertisement © WAM (Emirates News Agency) 2016 © Copyright Zawya. All Rights Reserved.

Accessible in both Arabic and English on DFM website; www.dfm.ae , this guide is the most recent addition to series of step-by-step booklets that offers potential issuers an insightful source to support their preparations for going public, whether Pre-, During or Post IPO. The guide is the outcome of fruitful collaboration with corporate communications advisors as it contains valuable contributions from carefully selected number of leading public relations, strategic communications and law firms including Asda’a Burson-Marsteller, Bell Pottinger, Brunswick, FTI consulting and Latham  and  Watkins LLP. His Excellency Essa Kazim, Chairman of DFM said; “We are pleased to launch this guide in line with DFM’s commitment to further reinforce the leading position of Dubai as a dynamic capital markets hub. Promoting the IPO sector by encouraging and supporting family and private companies to go public and list on DFM, has always been a main pillar of the growth strategy successfully implemented by the DFM over the past years. We are extensively investing time and effort to support private businesses in their preparation to go public and this has evidently delivered in the year 2014 by welcoming four IPOs. We are pursuing our efforts in order to achieve the best possible representation of key economic sectors in Dubai, further promote the growth of the financial sector and increase its contribution in the GDP in line with the Dubai 2021 plan.” Fahima Al Bastaki, Executive Vice President, Head of Business Development Division, DFM said: “As part of DFM’s ongoing commitment to promote best practices of corporate communications, Investor Relations and Corporate Governance amongst listed companies as well as potential issuers, we are pleased to launch this guide that explains the key elements of effective communications with stakeholders. The guide was DFM’s response to the huge interest we received from potential issuers who wanted to utilize various DFM tools and models developed over the past few years. It also sheds light on ways to develop IPO communication plans, encouraging an integrated communications approach to reaching investors (institutional and retail), utilizing a range of communication channels and digital communication tools. The guide also provides an insight about some of the case studies of successfully implemented IPOs on DFM. We would like to thank our partners of corporate communications advisors for their invaluable contribution to this comprehensive guide on ways to develop an IPO communication plan that effectively disseminates key messages and necessary information on the investment and success story of any potential issuer in a well-managed and consistent way.” Advertisement -Ends- About Dubai Financial Market:  Dubai Financial Market (DFM) was established as a public institution with its own independent corporate body.

Moreover, Voxin is very convenient for patients because of its simple once daily dose.” Around 120 doctors and pharmacists attended the event to hear Dr Bassam Mahboub, President of the Emirates Allergy and Respiratory Society (EARS) and Prof. Tobias Welte, Head of the Pulmonary Department and Infectious Diseases at the Hannover Medical School, Germany discuss the principles of management of chest infections and give an overview of Levofloxacin as one of the best solutions for the management of such infections. Prof. Tobias showed updated clinical trials and patient cases that ensured the benefits of Levoflixacin use in the respiratory tract infections, even in severe cases with resistant types of bacteria and how those patients got better in a shorter course of time.

HE Mattar Al Tayer, Director-General and Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors of RTA said: “the project undertaken by RTA in conjunction with Nakheel included the construction of a temporary entrance to Deira Islands and the opening of the Water Canal for navigation. Nakheel has started infrastructure for islands and maritime works by completing the entrance of the western bridge  and  linking it with Al Khaleej Road in the direction of the new ships harbor and fish market along the stretch of Abu Baker Al Siddique Road starting from the R/A at the intersection with Al Khaleej Road. The project also included opening the navigational lane beneath the bridge by removing about two million cubic meters of drilling materials in three landfill areas. Works also included extending the existing canal walls up to the new fish market marina in addition to lighting works, sewage, asphalt, shifting  and  protecting the existing services, and extending services along the bridges. Following the opening of the bridge, the project contractor will remove the last landfill area to complete works for opening the navigational canal. It is noteworthy that Deira Islands project, developed by Nakheel, is the new waterfront of Dubai. It comprises four man-made islands inside the Arabian Gulf waters along the stretch of Deira Beach spanning an area of about 17 m square meters. The project, which is the biggest development project in Deira, comprises the construction of hundreds of hotels, hotel apartments, multi-use buildings and marinas. The project is expected to be inhabited by 250 thousand persons and 80 thousand employees. Advertisement According to traffic studies, the volume of traffic generated by the project is about 110 thousand journeys during peak hours that requires the construction of a massive network of roads and transit systems. There will be three main entrances to the project, two at the intersection of Al Khaleej Road with Abu Baker Al Siddique Road and Al Quds Road, and the third extends from Al Mina Road alongside Rashid Port. The project provides for direct and free entrances through flyovers leading to all entrances of the project. -Ends- Trending on Zawya Advertisement People In The News 24 Jan 2017 24 Jan 2017 " .

American Girl's proprietary retail stores, such as this one in Chicago (nb: 360° video content), have welcomed over 80 million visitors, won numerous awards and are recognised as premiere models for experiential retail. The announcement sees Majid Al Futtaim Leisure and Entertainment, the leisure arm of Majid Al Futtaim, continue to expand its portfolio in bringing unique family entertainment offerings to the region, through a franchise agreement with the retailer. The iconic US brand will further bolster Majid Al Futtaim’s growing and diverse collection of internationally-renowned brands including LEGO®, lululemon athletica, AllSaints and Abercrombie  and  Fitch. The deal also encompasses Majid Al Futtaim being awarded exclusive distribution rights in the UAE, KSA, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman, spanning bricks and mortar retail, airport-based retail and e-commerce. The first American Girl store in the UAE is slated to open in 2017 and will feature engaging and immersive retail experiences, like the popular Doll Hair Salon and an on-site restaurant, as well as all of the latest product offerings – from the signature American Girl dolls, outfits, and accessories to the company’s best-selling books for girls. It is this expertise in innovation and experiential retail that, Damien Latham, Chief Executive Office of Majid al Futtaim Leisure and Entertainment, says helped Majid Al Futtaim stand out as the go-to premium operator to bring the partnership to life. “We are delighted to announce that we will be bringing American Girl’s first retail offering to shoppers in the region. For us American Girl is such an iconic brand, with such a clear personality and inspiring vision that marries perfectly with our ethos. This makes us extremely excited to think about what the future holds for the partnership as we begin to solidify the brand’s presence across the GCC. What differentiates us from the competition is that we’re able to offer attractive solutions for both retailers and consumers. We provide sought-after store locations for retailers through our extensive mall property portfolio, and consumers can enjoy a multifaceted retail experience across a range of platforms, from online to airports; as we tailor our retail offering to meet our shopper’s needs. This allows us to further cement our vision to deliver great moments to everyone, every day.” Having sold nearly 30 million American Girl dolls since it was founded in 1986, the brand has attracted a dedicated international audience through offering an inspiring world of dolls, content, and experiences aimed at young girls. “For 30 years, American Girl has been celebrating and encouraging girls to be their best with high-quality dolls and relevant characters, plus engaging books and entertainment,” said Katy Dickson, president of American Girl. “We’re thrilled to expand American Girl into the Middle East and bring our universally relevant mission—to be a trusted partner in building girls of strong character—to more girls, in more places. We’re equally excited to partner with the country’s leading shopping mall and retail pioneer Majid Al Futtaim to bring the American Girl experience to a whole new audience of girls and their families.” Inspired by girls, American Girl is proud to feature one of the most inclusive and diverse selections of dolls, providing a level of choice that is unmatched elsewhere. From the beginning, American Girl’s goal has been to create dolls and stories that act as both mirrors and windows—giving girls an opportunity to see a direct reflection of themselves or a chance to learn about a life or culture that may be very different from their own. -Ends- Media Contact: Taylyn Bush Weber Shandwick 04 445 4222 MAFLeisure@webershandwick.com The legal name of this company is “Majid Al Futtaim” and should not be shortened or replaced by an acronym to avoid confusion with another business entity.

Instant Payments 12 December 2016 Dubai – UAE: UAE’s leading financial institution, Mashreq and Novo Cinemas, a leading cinema chain in the Middle East announced the launch of a new strategic partnership that is set to completely change customers’ cinema experience. The official signing was attended by Subroto Som, Head of Retail Banking Group at Mashreq and Debbie Stanford – Kristiansen, CEO of Novo Cinemas, and Pankaj Kundra, Head of Payments at Mashreq and other officials from both organizations. For the first time ever in the UAE, Mashreq card holders can experience the full power of loyalty and convenience, on any Mashreq credit card through a whopping 50percent discount on 2D, 3D, IMAX and 7-Star tickets booked at the box-office, at www.Novocinemas.com or through the Novo Cinemas mobile app. They can also access dedicated ticketing and F and B counters at Novo Cinemas and get complimentary invites to movie previews and screenings based on their card spends. Subroto Som, Head of Retail Banking Group, Mashreq said, “The partnership with Novo Cinemas underlines our commitment to offer Mashreq cardholders the ultimate convenience both on their cards and their cinema experience. By combining half priced tickets any day of the week with the ‘queue-busting’ benefit that dedicated counters provide we have an offer that makes Mashreq credit cards the ultimate cinema companion.” Advertisement As an added benefit, Mashreq customers will soon be able to apply TAP n GO, the UAE’s first and only Near-field Communication (NFC) sticker solution. This tool converts any mobile phone into a credit card, and uses state-of-the-art NFC technology to allow instant payments through a unique ‘No Swiping, No Signing, No Waiting” benefit, which is ideally suited for cinema-goers. This allows you to ‘beat the queue’ both at the box-office and the snacks counter. Novo Cinemas CEO, Debbie Stanford Kristiansen, commented, “Novo Cinemas’ exclusive partnership with Mashreq across all 2D, 3D, IMAX  and  7-Star experiences will ensure customers experience the absolute best value for their entertainment dirham. With a focus on star treatment and quality customer service, Mashreq card holders will begin their great time out at Novo with a dedicated ticket counter, ensuring a swift and convenient cinema experience.    We are proud that this partnership also has a focus on EDUtainment, owing to Novo Cinemas and Mashreq’s shared commitment towards children’s education. With added platforms such as IMAX educational movies, our collaboration will deliver opportunities to expand the cinematic educational reach for all.” Pankaj Kundra, Head of Payments, Mashreq said, “By extending our partnership with Novo Cinemas across all our credit cards, we have added a significant ‘entertainment’ dimension to our existing propositions. We have also radically altered the ticket discount benefit – the typical benefit in the market today is Buy-1-Get-1, applicable only on standard seat classes or offered on weekdays only. Our customers can now receive 50percent off on every 2D, 3D or IMAX ticket, any day of the week.” -Ends- About Mashreq Mashreq is the oldest bank in the UAE with an extensive branch network across the Emirates.

REUTERS/Jumana El Heloueh REUTERS/Jumana El-Heloueh 12 December 2016 DUBAI — Dubai SME, the agency of the Department of Economic Development mandated to develop the Emirate’s small and medium enterprise (SME) sector, and Al Tamimi  and  Company, the largest law firm in the Middle East which specializes in patents and innovations, have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to support entrepreneurial innovations and patents. The MoU reflects both parties’ commitment to achieving the UAE’s vision to enable the SME sector to make a positive impact economically, socially and culturally. Saeed Matar Al Marri, Deputy CEO, signed the MoU on behalf of Dubai SME while Ahmad Saleh, Regional Director in charge of Patents, Industrial Designs, R  and  D and innovation, and Omar Obeidat, Partner and Head of Intellectual Property Department, signed for Al Tamimi  and  Company, in the presence of senior officials from both companies. The agreement will allow aspiring entrepreneurs to implement prototypes of their projects under patent protection. The Hamdan Innovation Incubator (Hi2), an initiative launched by Dubai SME, will co-ordinate with Al Tamimi  and  Company to patent innovations of registered members and provide legal services to protect their intellectual property. Advertisement Commenting on the partnership, Al Marri said Dubai SME is pleased to work together with Al Tamimi  and  Company to provide services that would encourage local innovations and inventions. “Dubai SME’s Hamdan Innovation Incubator is focussed on enabling UAE youth to invest their efforts and creativity in innovative ventures, thereby grooming a generation of successful entrepreneurs. This is the latest Dubai SME initiative designed to promote innovative start-ups and protect intellectual property,” Al Marri said. Al Marri added that the agreement supports the implementation of the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice President and Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, to make the UAE the most innovative nation in the world and maintain its position as the most innovative Arab nation. Ahmad Saleh said Al Tamimi is proud to partner with Dubai SME and extend its specialist legal knowledge, know-how and technical expertise in the fields of innovation and intellectual property, including patent protection, to local entrepreneurs. “We are pleased to play our part in spreading a culture of innovation and fostering developments in innovation in the UAE through the participation in awareness activities in collaboration with the Hamdan Innovation Incubator.” Omar Obeidat added: “Al Tamimi  and  Company looks forward to working with entrepreneurs and SMEs in the UAE, to provide them with legal guidance and assistance for the development, protection and commercialization of their innovations.” Hi2 was launched in September 2014 under the patronage of Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince and Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, to support and promote innovations and excellence among entrepreneurial initiatives across all categories. Located in the Business Village in Dubai, Hi2 also represents the largest concentration of SMEs in Dubai. © The Saudi Gazette 2016 More from: business Advertisement Advertisement People In The News 24 Jan 2017 24 Jan 2017 " .

However, there was good news for bankers this week as oil prices soared by 4 percent on Monday, scoring their highest gains since 2015, after oil producers agreed over the weekend to reduce output to curb oversupply and prop up prices. Read more here . Analysts said the outlook is likely to improve for GCC banks in 2017. “While operating conditions for banks in the GCC remain challenging, the stabilisation of oil prices — albeit at a low level — and resilient non-oil sectors will moderate pressures on the banking sector from slowing economic growth, fiscal reforms and spending cuts,” Olivier Panis, a vice-president at Moody’s, said in the Gulf News report . Lower oil prices and slower economic growth has encouraged banking executives to be smarter in how they operate and to come up with new initiatives to boost profitability, the chairman of the UAE Banks Federation, Abdul Aziz Al Ghurair, told Zawya in October.

During a difficult time great ideas come. In a great time everybody is a genius, in a bad time then the genius really comes out,” he said.

REUTERS/Stringer REUTERS/Stringer Taxation, VAT specialists in UAE are in short supply, according to recruitment experts 12 December 2016 By Cleofe Maceda Senior Web Reporter Dubai: With the forthcoming implementation of value-added tax (VAT) in the UAE and across the region, companies are going to face a huge talent crunch next year, according to recruitment specialists. Businesses in the UAE are gearing up for the collection of VAT in 2018. It was earlier forecast that the next tax policy will generate thousands of new vacancies for finance professionals. Taxation roles and other VAT-related positions are currently seeing very huge demand for skilled  professionals. Among the positions that have opened up recently include VAT managers, VAT and indirect tax specialists, senior VAT consultants and VAT junior associates and lead partners.  More positions are going to open up next year, with recruitment expected to intensify as the rollout draws closer. However, UAE professionals with VAT qualifications and experience are in short supply, prompting employers to look abroad to fill the gap and sweeten their compensation packages. Advertisement While a significant portion of the expatriate workforce in the UAE may be familiar VAT, many finance professionals in the country started their careers in the Gulf very early, so they lack the technical skills and experience in a tax environment. “There is definitely a shortage of skilled talent available,” said Gareth El Mettouri, associate director at Robert Half UAE. 'Many now senior finance professionals started their careers in a non-tax environment after graduation and will, without adequate training, find it difficult to transition themselves,' added Annalinde Nickisch, HR consultant at The Thought Factory. She said next year will see a high demand for candidates who know how to help organisations transition into a new tax environment. “The talent requirements for finance and tax professionals will exponentially increase as the VAT rollout approaches,” Nickisch told Gulf News. Among the candidates that will be hugely in demand are those who have the experience in filling sales tax returns, as well as VAT specialsts and professionals who have the knowledge in VAT registration process, administration, fines and penalties and 'impact on the operational and the financial performance' of companies. “Many companies will need to re-implement, re-configure, and re-customize their existing systems as a large number of installations of popular accounting software or in-house designed ERP (enterprise resource planning) solutions may not have the inbuilt capacity to apply VAT onto the invoice value,” said Nickisch. “This in turn will lead to a high demand of technical- functional and techno-functional- consultants who possess knowledge and experience in transitioning business processes into becoming compliant with the new VAT framework.” Heading into the New Year, Robert Half has predicted that starting salaries for tax-related roles will see a rise of 4 per cent or above, higher than the average of 2.3 per cent for accounting and finance roles in the region. Tax directors in large companies can expect the biggest increase in salaries, at a 6.5 per cent, while tax managers can see pay hikes of between 4.3 per cent and 4.7 per cent. “Businesses across nearly all sectors will need to start reviewing their operational finance systems and process in preparation for the implementation of taxation and VAT over the next year,” said El Mettouri. “Firms will need to also factor in the implications of VAT when rolling-out their ERP and SAP (systems applications and products) implementation. “ While some firms have already beefed up their recruitment drive, other organisations have opted to provide their existing staff with the necessary training, to prepare their businesses for the implementation of VAT. “Many larger organizations have already initiated trainings by engaging external service providers to ensure that accounting and finance professionals within the organization are knowledgeable on the VAT registration process, VAT administration, fines and penalties related to VAT filing and its subsequent impact on the operational and the financial performance of the business,” said Nickisch. Smaller companies, on the other hand, haven't done much to update their accounting and finance departments.  'While some companies are proactively evaluating existing capabilities, filling gaps by conducting trainings and identifying hiring requirements, numerous businesses, especially in the SME market space, haven't given it a lot of thought yet,' said Nickisch. As to whether or not UAE-based candidates can still take advantage of the huge demand, Nickisch said those that have 'prior working experience in a taxable environment' could land good offers. © Gulf News 2016 Trending on Zawya Advertisement People In The News 24 Jan 2017 24 Jan 2017 " .

REUTERS/Ahmed Jadallah Reuters/Ahmed Jadallah Friday, Dec 09, 2016 Dubai: Fire safety in UAE buildings will get a boost with Dubai Municipality planning to set up its own laboratory to test building materials and products for fire resistance. The civic body is in discussions with Dubai Civil Defence to finalise the establishment of the new laboratory, Khalid Mohammad Sherif Al Awadi, assistant director-general for Health, Safety and Environment Control, said on Thursday. Once operational, the fire-testing lab, which will work under the Dubai Central Laboratory (DCL) of Dubai Municipality, will be used by the civil defence authorities in the country to test and certify fire resistance of building materials and fire safety products and systems, said Amin Ahmad Mohammad, director of DCL. Ali Ahmad Elian, head of Engineering Materials Laboratory Section at DCL, said the proposed lab’s building has been constructed in Al Warsan area and it is expected to be equipped for operations by the end of next year. Advertisement “It will be the first government facility in the UAE to test and certify building materials and products for fire safety,” Elian told Gulf News. He said the authorities have so far been depending on some overseas laboratories and two private labs in Dubai. “We had very limited resources to do fire testing at DCL.” He pointed out that the lab will facilitate the implementation of the updated fire safety code that is expected soon. The fire safety code was revised following several fire accidents including the New Year Eve’s blaze at The Address Hotel minutes before the New Year fireworks display at neighbouring Burj Khalifa. Officials said the updated fire code is expected to be implemented by the civil defence authorities soon. The code stipulates strict and sustainable fire-resistant standards and requirements for building materials and the lab will help ensure that they are compliant. “Fire resistance of cladding, thermal insulation materials, concrete blocks, and other products will be tested at the lab. Based on the results, civil defence will approve and certify them. In the later stages, fire protection systems like fire alarms and sprinklers will also be tested. “Tests will be conducted to see how long the building materials can stand fires. The process will include various equipment, furnaces, and walls to simulate fire accidents and that is why the lab has been located away from the city,” he explained. Officials said the materials will also be tested for their sustainability and compliance with the green building standards stipulated by the municipality. They spoke after a press conference held to announce the 4th International Conference on Quality Assurance for Sustainable Construction Materials. The conference will be held organised by Dubai Municipality at Emirates Towers Hotel on December 14 and 15. Al Awadi said the focus of the conference this year is on the role of quality building materials in achieving higher standards of sustainability and safety in buildings and infrastructure. The conference programme also includes a workshop conducted by ASTM International, an international standards development organisation, on the extent of fire resistance of external coating products and workshops on testing of green building products, and the development of 3D concrete printing presented by engineers of DCL. by Sajila Saseendran Senior Reporter Gulf News 2016. All rights reserved. © Copyright Zawya.

According to a senior Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) official, the entire fleet of around 9,500 taxis in Dubai will be equipped with the special cameras in phases, completing the project by early 2018. Gulf News reported earlier this year when the RTA piloted surveillance cameras on a select batch of taxis. “We have successfully completed the trial and we found the cameras useful in improving operational efficiency. We are now in talks with all the franchises to begin the installation of the cameras which will be done in phases over the next year,” said Adel Shakeri, director of Transportation Systems at RTA’s Public Transport Agency. Advertisement Interestingly, the surveillance system will not cover any of the passengers to protect their privacy. “The surveillance system will have each taxi equipped with three tiny cameras, one installed near the central mirror of the vehicles, covering only the driver, while the other two are set up at the front and rear of the taxi, externally. None of the cameras will show the passengers,” said Shakeri. The cameras will be connected to the operation command centre (OCC) of the Public Transport Agency, but it will not relay live feed. “In the first phase, the cameras will not provide live footage from the taxis, but they will be connected to the OCC and whenever required we will be able to download the footage,” added Shakeri. According to Shakeri, the surveillance system is as much about monitoring the activities of the taxi drivers as it is about finding proof in cases of disputes. “The system will have technology to detect fatigue levels of drivers, but in the first phase we are primarily looking into using it as an operational tool. This will in a way help taxi drivers prove their innocence when they face complaints against them,” he added. Apart from enhancing operational efficiency of the taxis, the CCTV cameras are expected to improve the level of security for passengers as well. “The cameras will help RTA monitor the performance of drivers, to see if the drivers are taking the necessary steps to improve the comfort level of the passengers,” said Shakeri. Surveillance cameras are the latest in a series of enhancements Dubai’s fleet of taxis is going through. Last month, RTA announced Dubai taxis will soon have interactive LCD screens, while passengers will be able enjoy free WiFi on a fleet of limousine taxis. Some of the smart gadgets on taxis include Global Positioning System, tailgating alert system and Nol and credit card payment options that are now available on all taxis. Last year, taxis in Abu Dhabi were equipped with surveillance cameras. by Shafaat Shahbandari Staff Reporter Gulf News 2016. All rights reserved. © Copyright Zawya. All Rights Reserved.

The purpose of the memorandum is to extend the current scope of collaboration, and explore how DMCC can offer insight as the two entities work towards establishing a universal Sharia-compliant gold exchange for Islamic markets. Establishing such an exchange has been a topic of debate following a recent initiative by the World Gold Council and the Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial Institutions that allows gold to be used as a commodity to back Sharia-based financial products. “This MoU also strengthens the trading relations between Turkey and the UAE while reflecting DMCC’s commitment to developing Sharia-compliant market infrastructure to support the future growth of the Islamic economy,” said Ahmad Bin Sulayem, DMCC’s Executive Chairman. Advertisement At the signing ceremony, Bin Sulayem also discussed with Borsa Istanbul officials ongoing cooperation in creating delivery centres for precious metals in Istanbul and Dubai. The MoU builds upon DMCC’s current scope of collaboration with Borsa Istanbul, and will seek to draw upon the capabilities of DMCC’s Free Zone, its DMCC Tradeflow platform and Dubai Gold and Commodities Exchange.

There are different components in different parts of the UAE,” Dr Ismahane Elouafi, director-general of ICBA, told Gulf News. “Soil is very diverse. They host millions and billions of microorganisms that live in the soil. We have not completely understood all that population yet. So this museum is the beginning of understanding the different types of soil, the different microflora that are in it and to bring awareness of their importance.” Advertisement Soil and the ecosystems services it provides, including food, fuel, fibre and feed production, are critical for life on earth. Hence the need to encourage people to preserve soil for generations to come, which is the museum’s major role. “The museum will help raise awareness of soil research and preservation, demonstrate the importance of soil in urban planning and its underlining measure to manage and secure food,” Mohammad Saif Al Suwaidi, director-general of ADFD, said. More than 95 per cent of global food production uses soil as a base. By 2050, agricultural production must increase by 60 per cent to meet food demand, putting pressure on land resources. Threats to soil have a direct effect on food production and globally, 33 per cent of the land is in a state of degradation. Below five per cent of the land in the UAE is arable. But the ICBA has successfully conducted various research to improve agricultural productivity and sustainability in marginal and saline environments like those in the UAE. At the museum, vertical slices of soil or soil monoliths taken from across the country are displayed to show the natural state of soil. Visitors will get a chance to see how simple soil changes, such as porosity, soil structure, types of minerals present, among others. The museum also contains samples of the Anhydrite soil found on the coastal lands of the UAE. This world-first discovery helped the UAE gain international recognition from the US Department of Agriculture and it was officially added into the US Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Anhydrite can sometimes be used for soil treatment, for substitutes for gypsum, and some industrial uses.

Properties boast features such as eco-friendly housing, water recycling units and waste segregation December 8, 2016; Dubai, UAE Premium realty exhibition for non-resident Indians, the Indian Property Show, raised its curtain today in the presence of Bollywood celebrity Arbaaz Khan, Chief Guest H. E. Butti Saeed Al Ghandi, Second Vice-Chairman of the Dubai World Trade Centre, and the Indian real-estate fraternity. The three-day extravaganza is playing host to top developers across India with thousands of various properties on offer.Attendees will have the luxury to choose from among hundreds of projects ranging from apartments, villas, row houses, plots, commercial to retail properties to suit their budget, besides benefiting from a number of educative and informative property-related seminars. The event is being held at Hall 2, Dubai World Trade Centre, and is open to visitors from 11am to 8pm on all three days, with provision for free parking. Now in its 19th edition, the real-estate show is organised by Sumansa Exhibitions.  “For NRIs residing in the UAE, the Indian Property Show is more than just a real-estate exhibition,”said R. Srividya, General Manager – Corporate Sales  and  Brand Engagement, Indian Property Show at Sumansa Exhibitions, “It is a perfect opportunity to touch base with the latest happenings and updates on the real-estate front back home– particularly now that we are witnessing several important measures that have impacted the realty industry directly and indirectly. “For NRIs, these changes herald good omen since many builders are already adopting 100 percent transparency policy and cheque payments, which obviously boosts the trust level between the two parties. The implementation of RERA rules, have also been instrumental in bringing professionalism, standardization and transparency in real estate sector. This, along with the recent wave of demonetization has helped the Indian realty industry emerge more transparent and buyer-friendly. Moreover, since demonetization has increased liquidity with the banks, there’s now lesser dependence on banks on high cost borrowings. Coupled with high deposit growth, weak credit growth and weakened rupee, this would create opportunities for lending rate cuts, allowing investment activities to pick-up especially in the mortgage driven real estate sector,” added R. Srividya. Despite initial hiccups, experts foresee an uplift of the real-estate sector in the long-term as a result of these corrective measures. Consumer sentiment has already improved over the last year, and reputed developers are reporting higher transactions. With RERA Bill in place in particular, NRI consumers will no longer have to deal with delayed possession, fluctuating prices and diversion of funds towards other projects – to name a few – instilling confidence in the Indian developers and the country’s real-estate sector. “The direct and most significant benefit of demonetization is increased liquidity across the banks. Such availability of funds will lead to lowering the rate of interest across different loans which will in turn reduce EMI giving a boost to real-estate demand. We expect home loan rates to be down to approx. 7-8percent”, commented Mr. Dharmesh Shah, Vice President –Head Residential Sales  and  Marketing, Adani Realty. Advertisement “By bringing greater compliance, RERA will help making real estate class more efficient, transparent  and  healthy than any other asset class, so best time to buy real estate is now”, further added Shah. Ashwinder Raj Singh, Chief Executive Officer – Residential Services, JLL India added: “The passing of RERA (Real Estate Regulation and Development Act 2016), the Benami Transactions Act and the demonetization move will ensure the sector loses much of its historic taint. Only players who conduct their business with integrity are expected to survive. This bodes well for end-users, who will be aware of their rights and have the assurance of not being cheated. They will be able to buy properties of their choice at affordable prices, in projects which will undoubtedly be delivered on time”. Traditionally, the Indian Property Show conducts several property-related seminars to guide buyers on various aspects of property purchase. Keeping in view the confusion surrounding demonetization, this year’s event will host exclusive seminars on the issue to discuss impact of demonetization on Indian real-estate sector, the effect on market value of property, and due diligence measures for NRI investments. Other topics cover advice on legal processes involved in buying property, Vaastu’s role in property purchase and interior designing, RERA and taxation, focus on various cities, an NRI guide to property investment in India and hotspots in South India’s residential real estate. Visitors will have access to variety of properties across India including key cities such as Delhi, Noida, Greater Noida, Gurgaon, Jaipur, Kolkata, Goa, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Pune, Chennai, Coimbatore, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Mangalore and Kochi. In line with the latest advancements in the architectural world, the properties boast of the high-end amenities and excellent infrastructure including features such as eco-friendly housing, water recycling units, waste segregation etc. Attendees will also have the opportunity for an exclusive face-to-face interaction with prominent developers including the likes of Wadhwa Group, Godrej Properties, J. P. Infra, Mantri Developer Pvt. Ltd, Mahindra LifeSpaces, Tridentia, Ozone Urbana Infra Developers, Acron, Piramal Developers, Prime Expat Infra, Salarpuria Sattva, Isha Homes, Shakti Construction, South India Shelters, Sobha Developers, Shankar Adobes, Vatika Group  and  Shree Ram Group amongst many others.    -Ends- For more information, log on to: https://www.facebook.com/IndianPropertyShow https://twitter.com/indianprptyshow https://instagram.com/indianpropertyshow Email :  Contact@IndianPropertyShow.com For media enquiries, please contact: Sa’adia Reza, Pulse 360 PR  and  Marketing Communications Tel: +971 4 2327789 Mob: + 97150 4765309  Email:  saadia@pulse360me.com   anuroopa@pulse360me.com © Press Release 2016 Trending on Zawya Advertisement People In The News 24 Jan 2017 24 Jan 2017 " .

The opening of the Emirates Soil Museum is a joint initiative between ICBA and ADFD. Speaking at the inauguration ceremony, Dr. Ismahane Elouafi, Director General of ICBA, said: “We at ICBA are very proud and happy to have partnered with ADFD for this momentous initiative. Indeed, the museum is a result of continued support by the UAE government for efforts to collect, preserve and share information about the country’s natural heritage, including soils. We are confident that the museum will serve as an excellent repository of knowledge for anyone who is interested in soil preservation and soils of the UAE.” H.E. Mohammed Saif Al Suwaidi, Director General of ADFD, said: “ADFD is committed to drive sustainable socio-economic growth in the education and environment sectors within the UAE and abroad. Our newest venture with ICBA exemplifies our dedication to expand our scope of partnerships and bring awareness to agriculture and food security. Our nation’s continuity depends on research, innovation, environmental consciousness and scientific ingenuity. The museum will serve as a pioneering and informative resource and technical hub for the MENA region. Furthermore, it’s vital that our next generations are aware of these important issues and this partnership allows for an interactive platform that will serve the country well.” Soils and the ecosystem services they provide, including food, fuel, fiber, and feed production, are critical for life on the Earth. Soils also play an important role in regulating greenhouse gas emissions. The largest store of terrestrial carbon is in the soils. So their preservation may contribute to climate change mitigation. Advertisement These services, along with the role of soils in the environment, agriculture, and food security, as well as the types of soil that are found in the UAE, will be the focus of the museum. Through both aboveground and underground exhibits, soil information, including soil and water salinity, soil acidity and alkalinity, why soils are of different colors, and the role of soil in water infiltration, will be showcased using interactive experiences. Customized simulators will allow visitors to see firsthand the role that soil plays in natural processes, such as the development of different types of sand dunes and water infiltration. Soil monoliths, or vertical slices of soil that serve as a visual aid for the natural state of soil, are displayed under six themes: Winds of Time, New Soil Discovery, Soils and Ecosystem, Soils and Food Security, Soil and Climate Change, and Threats to Soil. Visitors to the museum will be able to see how simple soil changes, such as porosity, soil structure, the types of minerals present, and soil types influence water infiltration, water and nutrient holding capacities, food production, plant root development, and the accumulation of organic matter. The museum also features a library collection of soil publications and soil atlases of the GCC countries. The idea for the museum, which is the first of its kind in the region, was conceived at the international conference “Soil Classification and Reclamation of Degraded Lands in Arid Environments” in Abu Dhabi in 2010. In addition to serving as an information hub, the museum is a critical element of building awareness around the issues of soil degradation and loss. Information and education, like that provided by the museum, can play a critical role in raising awareness about threats to soil and provide an opportunity for people to become better advocates for policies and practices that will protect the soils nationally and globally. Based on the premises of ICBA in Dubai, the museum is designed to cater to the needs of a variety of visitors, including school children, university students, researchers, professionals and scientists, environmentalists, professional contractors, land use planners, decision- and policy-makers. It is hoped that the museum will help to raise awareness and foster appreciation of the importance of soils for national development and food security. -Ends- Press enquiries:  Mr. Showkat Nabi Rather: s.rather@biosaline.org.ae , or +971 55 1378653 Mr. Abdumutalib Begmuratov: a.begmuratov@biosaline.org.ae  , or +971 56 505 2483 ABOUT ICBA The International Center for Biosaline Agriculture (ICBA) is an international, non-profit research-for-development organization that aims to strengthen agricultural productivity in marginal and saline environments through identifying, testing and facilitating access to sustainable solutions for food, nutrition and income security. http://www.biosaline.org/ About ADFD Abu Dhabi Fund for Development is a national organization owned by the Abu Dhabi government.

There have been several amendments to the Dubai Financial Services Authority (“DFSA”) Rules in 2016. In this article we highlight some of the more recent changes in the DIFC and to the DFSA Rulebook that may be of interest to some of our clients who are either already present in the DIFC or who are looking to establish a presence in the DIFC. New Intermediate SPV Vehicles  The DFSA and DIFC held a joint seminar on 31 October on structuring and the new ‘Intermediate SPV’ regime with the focus being on fund structuring. (‘Intermediate’ referring to such vehicles sitting in an intermediate position in a structure). The Intermediate SPV is a recent development by the DIFC Authority which provides a cost effective option for establishing SPVs in the DIFC (i.e., only US$1,000) not just in respect of fund structures but across the board.  Advertisement There has been the option to establish Special Purpose Companies in the DIFC previously, and this option remains, but these are comparatively expensive and process-heavy to set up. The new Intermediate SPVs will be cheaper and easier to establish. No change of law or rules has occurred as yet, but the entities are available now through standardised waivers which will apply when an application is made to the DIFC Authority. However, the Intermediate SPVs will only be available to entities that already have a substantive presence in the DIFC (i.e., fund managers, asset managers, family offices etc).  This development is a step closer to what the ADGM offers by way of SPVs and will make life easier and cheaper as far as structuring options go for existing DIFC entities, but doesn’t go quite as far as the ADGM regime due to the requirement to already have a substantive DIFC presence. Amendments to DFSA Legislation On 22 June 2016, the DFSA published a notice of amendments to the DFSA Rulebook based on the changes proposed in consultation paper 103 and consultation paper 105. This includes changes to the insurance regime, the AML Annual Return deadline and stipulations for communications with the DFSA. These amendments came into effect on 1 August 2016. Changes to the insurance regime The recent amendments have provided for the below changes to the DFSA’s insurance regime: Clarification that Insurers Effecting Contracts of Insurance can give advice and undertake Insurance Intermediation activities relating to their own products and those of Group members. The definition of Insurance Intermediation has been expanded to cover operators of aggregation sites. The exclusions to Insurance Intermediation and Insurance Management have been amended to cover various activities which are not intended to regulated as financial services. Removal of the overlap between Insurance Intermediation and Insurance Management. Introduction of the new defined terms ‘Insurance Agents’ and ‘Insurance Brokers’. Clarification around the application of the Conduct of Business requirements to reinsurance activities. More clarity around disclosure requirement in relation to conflicts of interests arising from ownership links. The Expenditure Based Capital Minimum requirement applicable to Insurance Intermediaries handling Insurance Monies has been lowered from 18 weeks of operational expenditure to 9 weeks of operational expenditure.  Requirements for Insurance Managers to give some additional declarations in their annual return. The introduction of new reporting requirements for Insurers, including branches, and also for Insurance Managers which conduct underwriting activities. Online Applications and Submission of Data to the DFSA The legislative changes that were set out in Consultation Paper No.105 have now been implemented. Essentially the DFSA intend to increase the range of transactions, and interactions, which can take place online. The DFSA will introduce an online portal that will allow entities and individuals to submit electronic data directly to the DFSA. The portal will be accessible from the DFSA website, in the same way as is currently the case for the Electronic Prudential Reporting System.  In the first phase of work, which is intend to be complete by the end of 2016, various DFSA authorization application forms and the Annual AML return will be made available through the online portal. Additionally, the timing of submission of the annual AML return has changed. Instead of being due four months’ after the end of the Relevant Person’s financial year, this return will in future be due by the end of September each year and the report must cover the period from August of the previous year up to and including July of the lodgement year.  Regulatory Actions Authorised Firm conducting prohibited insurance activity in the UAE On the 21 September 2016 the DFSA issued a Decision Notice and imposed a fine of USD 85,191 on an Authorised Firm, who is licensed to provide the Financial Service of Insurance Intermediation. The fine was imposed following a DFSA investigation conducted in collaboration with the United Arab Emirates Insurance Authority.  Under the DFSA Rulebook Authorised Firms are prohibited from intermediating a Contract of Insurance for a risk situated in the UAE unless:  the risk is situated in the DIFC; or  the contract is one of re-insurance.  The DFSA’s investigation identified that the Authorised Firm intermediated contracts of Insurance for customers with risks situated in the UAE and outside the DIFC, which were not contracts of re-insurance in breach of the abovementioned DFSA Rules. The Authorised Firm also and failed to have adequate systems and controls in place to detect, monitor and prevent such activities from occurring.  DFSA concerns over Authorised Firm’s AML systems and licensed activities On the 18 of October 2016 the DFSA accepted an Enforceable Undertaking from an Authorised Firm as a result of the DFSA concerns about the firm’s anti-money laundering systems and controls, and about whether it had carried out the Financial Service of Providing Custody to its clients without being licensed to do so. Although the firm did not agree with the DFSA’s findings, it acknowledges the DFSA’s concerns and agrees to engage an independent expert to ensure that the concerns are remedied.  The firm also agreed to pay a financial penalty of USD 60,000 to the DFSA of which USD 30,000 is payable on or by 17 November 2016. The remaining USD 30,000 is suspended indefinitely and becomes payable if the firm fails to comply with the Enforceable Undertaking. Future Amendments to DFSA Legislation To complete our summary of regulatory updates in the DIFC, we also feel is of importance to mention the following proposed amendments to the DFSA Rulebook that have been addressed in the below listed consultation papers. Please note all three of these consultation papers have finished their consultation period and the proposed amendments to the DFSA Rulebook will be implemented when the relevant Rulemaking instruments are issued by the DFSA. Below is a summary of the changes that each Consultation paper has proposed.  Please note the proposed changes will not come into force until the relevant Rulemaking instrument has been published by the DFSA and please also be aware that the proposals contained within the consultation papers may change. Therefore ultimately only the text of the amended Rulebook and/or Law as published in the Rulemaking instrument can be relied upon. Consultation paper 106 The DFSA issued Consultation paper 106 due to what they felt was a lack of clarity in some areas of regulation. Therefore Consultation paper 106 proposes to provide greater clarity to the meaning and scope of ‘arranging’ related Financial Services, Operating a Representative Office and the Financial Promotions regime.  In summary, the Consultation paper proposes to make the following changes: combine arranging and advising activities relating to credit into a new separate Financial Service of ‘Arranging and Advising on Credit’;       introduce clarifications about what Financial Services an Insurance Broker and an Insurance Agent require; provide for some changes to the activities excluded from regulation under arranging and advising; provide guidance to create clarity about the intended scope of a Representative Office licence; remove the application of the Client Asset provisions to firms ‘Arranging Custody’; and refine the Financial Promotions regime to minimise the risk of abuse of that regime. In light of the above proposals, when they come in force, some Authorised Firms may need Licences for a different type of activity than they currently hold. It is proposed that the DFSA would generally allow a period of six months for the firms to complete the necessary formalities to obtain the right type of Licence. Representative Offices and persons carrying out Financial Promotions which act beyond the scope of their Licences or of the DFSA Rules, as would be clarified under these proposals, would need to cease such activities immediately.  Consultation paper 107 In consultation paper 107, the DFSA is proposing changes to the Anti-Money Laundering, Counter-Terrorist Financing and Sanctions Module (‘AML Module’) in order to make sure that the regime remains up-to-date in light of the 2012 Financial Action Task Force Recommendations and the recent amendments made to the UAE Federal Law No.4 of 2002 and other UAE AML Legislation. In summary, the Consultation paper proposes to make the following changes in the AML Module: Amend various definitions in order to reflect updates to the UAE Federal AML Laws.  Provide further clarity in relation to applying a Risk Based Approach. updates relating to the prohibition on dealing with Shell Banks and opening anonymous accounts. Provide further guidance on what measures should be taken to understand a client’s source of wealth and source of funds and when identifying ultimate beneficial owners. Amend the guidance regarding outsourcing customer due diligence. Amend the application of the ‘Sanctions and other international obligations’, the ‘Money Laundering Reporting Officer’ and the ‘Suspicious Activity Reports’ Chapters to apply to all persons that the AML Module applies to. Provide guidance about the application of United Nations Security Council resolutions. Provide guidance around the DFSA’s processes in relation to freezing of funds or assets. Provide further guidance around what activities are captured under the current Designated Non-Financial Business or Professions definition. Consultation paper 108 In consultation paper 108 the DFSA is proposing amendments to the capital requirements for managers of collective investment funds and amendments to the rules regarding reporting suspicions of market abuse. In relation to capital requirements for managers of collective investment funds, it is proposed to leave the required expenditure based capital minimum as it is. However the DFSA proposes to reduce the Base Capital Requirement for: a) managers of Public Funds to USD 140,000; and b) managers of Exempt Funds and QIFs to USD 70,000. An obligation to report suspicions of market abuse to the DFSA is currently imposed on market operators (i.e. Operators of Authorised Market Institutions and of Alternative Trading Systems). However there is not an explicit obligation on Authorised Firms to report suspicions of market abuse by others for whom the firm may be acting. Therefore the DFSA proposes to amend the DFSA Rulebook so that Authorised Firms and Recognised Members are under an explicit obligation to report suspicions of market abuse to the DFSA. © Al Tamimi  and  Company 2016 Advertisement Advertisement People In The News 24 Jan 2017 24 Jan 2017 " .

Customers can use the chat-bot to display Mashreq products and perform card-less cash transactions, low ticket local transfers and inquire about balance and recent transactions on an account. The Bot will shortly be integrated on all the banks digital platforms, making it easier to access account information from different locations using one password. Aref Al Ramli, Head of Digital Banking  and  Innovation commented: “We live a world where the digital accessibility is becoming a huge phenomenon and as we are moving more into the digital realm it’s important to evolve with the changing times. With the launch of the Bot, its chat based transfers and card-less cash, which is first of its kind in the UAE and the Region, this makes it easier for customers to perform transactions, requests and inquiries. The Mashreq Bot will also integrate its Snapp mobile application to leverage on the Bot or robot technology.” Upon selecting the ‘Mashreq-Bot’ tab, which can be accessed through Facebook Messenger application, customers will be engaged in a conversation with the robot which will guide them through a series of security authentication steps using Mashreq’s online banking and a One Time Password to the registered mobile number. After activating and linking the Bot, customers will be able to check banking products and do various chat-based transactions in a simple and easy fashion anywhere and instantly.   Al Ramli continued: “Mashreq’s long history of breakthroughs only motivates us to continue launching innovations that matter to make a meaningful difference to customers and improve customer experience.  In a world where time is more precious than ever, we are constantly innovating to provide quick, simple and smarter solutions. We will keep on enhancing our artificial intelligence capabilities and have a road map of products and services to be integrated with the Chatbot.” This is the banks second attempt at using artificial intelligence to better the services after announcing in 2016 that the bank is integrating with Apple’s Siri for voice-powered payments. This adds to a host of recent additions that make banking with Mashreq a convenient and innovative experience for all its customers.

REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins Reuters/Carlos Garcia Rawlins DUBAI, 7th December, 2016 (WAM) -- The Dubai Health Authority (DHA) doctors have recently published a study in the American Thoracic Society in San Francisco about their research, which shows the link between supplementation of Vitamin D and improved outcomes in Asthma patients. The study is the first-of-its-kind to be conducted in the Middle East and one of few studies in the world on markers of allergy and inflammation in the world. Dr Bassam Mahboob, Head of Respiratory Department at Rashid Hospital, and head of Emirates Respiratory and Allergy society, and lead researcher, said: ' We conducted the research on 100 chronic asthma patients and the results clearly pointed out that vitamin D supplementation in the treatment of asthma reduced their symptoms and improved their condition. Vitamin D is known as the sunshine vitamin and more and more research points out that it is linked with overall immunity.' Vitamin-D deficiency is also a contributing factor for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, period problems, depression etc. Dr Mahboob said in the UAE more than 70 per cent of the population suffers from Vitamin D deficiency and while it is recommended for everyone to be aware of their vitamin D levels, those with chronic health conditions should keep a close eye on their vitamin D levels. About 90 per cent of a person’s recommended intake of vitamin D is produced by the body in response to the sun’s ultraviolet rays. About 20 per cent of a person’s recommended vitamin D intake is derived from foods such as salmon, mackerel, sardines and milk. Dr Anwar Al Hammadi, Director of Dermatology at the DHA, highlighted that people with vitamin D deficiency should seek medical advice to determine the right course of treatment. 'My advice would be that patients should first check their vitamin D levels, and then follow the advice of the medical practitioner. Use of vitamin D supplements, healthy diet and wise sun exposure is required to tackle this health problem. In most cases, only sun exposure will not solve the problem and the level of vitamin D is vital to decide the best course of treatment.' Dr Nada Al Mulla, Head of Medical Affairs Unit, Barsha Primary Healthcare Centre, added that the best way to get sun exposure is during off peak hours, which is between 10 am till 3 pm. 'Amount of sun exposure needed depends of the skin type as well. People with fair skin are more prone to skin cancer as they absorb the rays of the sun at a faster rate, which means they need much lesser exposure to sun, than those with tanned skin because absorption of sun rays is slower in people with darker skins. For example: A person with fair skin may need only 15 minutes of daily sun exposure to correct his vitamin D levels whereas a person with tanned skin may need 30 to 40 minutes.' She warned that sun exposure during peak hours is harmful to health and repeated sub exposure during peak hours may lead to skin cancer so it is important to seek sun exposure during off peak hours only. Shaima Qayed, clinical dietician in Al Mizhar health centre, said fatigue, pain in joints, hair fall etc. are some of the signs of low vitamin D and that regular tests can help keep a check on vitamin D levels. 'Foods that provide vitamin D are: fortified milk, eggs, oily fish, such as salmon, sardines and tuna, fortified breakfast cereals etc. However, food cannot be the only source of vitamin D, exposure to sunlight at off peak hours and regular testing to check Vitamin D levels is also necessary.' © Copyright Emirates News Agency (WAM) 2016. © Copyright Zawya.

These include a new central bank and banking law that reflects a substantial amendment to our existing Central Bank Union Law No. 10 of 1980, that among other things will further enhance Central Bank’s independence and governance; and better align of our macro-prudential institutional framework our banking sector regulation and supervision with best practices; as well as strengthen safety nets, Al Hamiz said at the opening of the two-day 12th High-Level Meeting for Global Banking Standards and Regulatory and Supervisory Priorities, co-organised by Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Financial Stability Institute, and the Arab Monetary Fund. The programme also includes a new Public debt law that will form the foundation to develop our domestic debt capital markets. It can provide a new source of funding for the federal and local governments, create a yield curve, and provide banks with the additional options to fulfill compliance with the new liquidity rules. A third ingredient is a newly drafted, but not yet approved Federal investment law, which could further improve prospects for enhancing the foreign direct investment (FDI). The fourth ingredient of the regulatory development programme is a draft of 'Netting Law' that will lead to strengthening the stability of financial markets in the country and increase the possibility of credit availability and reduce costs for banks involved in the UAE. The new law is being prepared by the Central Bank of the UAE and the Ministry of Finance in coordination with the other concerned government entities, the official said. 'At the Central Bank of the UAE we are also closer to the finalization of implementation plans to phase in the Basel III framework, which will migrate our banking sector towards the Basel III standards for both capital and liquidity,' he said. On reflection, 2016 has been a very productive year for the Central Bank of the UAE. This year has made our path to meet our supervisory challenges on the short- and mid-term horizons much clearer. In addition, during 2016, the Central Bank also drafted and socialised several new circulars, to all our banks among other things, designed to improve corporate governance, and risk management. The regulatory framework for non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) is also currently under review, with a view to enhancing their organization, development, regulation, and supervisory oversight, Al Hamiz noted. The UAE Central Bank also recognises that the development of FinTech (financial technology) will play an important role in shaping the future of the financial services industry in the UAE. In this regard, we are in the process of finalizing two new regulations in this area, specifically dealing with digital payments and crowd funding. The apex bank anticipates the adoption the forthcoming regulations over the ensuing months. A newly enacted bankruptcy law within the UAE has also been a key step toward improving the legal framework for resolving corporate insolvency, including small and medium-size enterprises, SMEs. 'But as all regulators know tomorrow will be a new day with new challenges and in this regard this high level meeting is both welcome and timely. We need to remain engaged in active discussion not just in looking back to the financial crisis, at issues that have been resolved or may remain in process of being addressed, but we also need to look forward at issues that are or could be emerging for our respective financial sectors,' Al Hamiz said. The agenda and sessions of the High-Level Meeting for Global Banking Standards and Regulatory and Supervisory Priorities provides participants with an opportunity to discuss and consider key issues. In particular, Al Hamiz said the Central Bank looks forward to sharing views on banking conduct and culture, as well as debating why risk models might still be useful, especially, post the financial crisis and our overriding efforts to limit risks in banking. 'Moreover, within the GCC region, we are all aware that we continue to face supervisory challenges for financial stability. Through this high level meeting and its sessions, we can support one another, in an open forum, in our continued efforts in this regard,' Al Hamiz said. Some risks, he noted, arise from our domestic conditions, but global risks can also be very important, especially for an open economy like the UAE that strives for further trade and financial integration within the global economy. 'Therefore, we need to closely monitor global developments and be ready to intervene to mitigate their adverse domestic spillovers and hedge against potential risks.' The Financial Stability Unit at the UAE Central Bank plays a crucial role in this respect, he said. 'It monitors and reports on the potential build-up of system wide risks and vulnerabilities in the financial sector, as well as makes recommendations to mitigate these risks.' The unit is in the final stage of formalising the macro-prudential framework, he noted and said it will define macro-prudential tools most suitable for the UAE financial system and the context in which these tools would be activated. The development of macro-prudential policies will enhance the stability of the financial system, which will further support the UAE macroeconomic priorities. Turning to the UAE economy, the Central Bank's estimate is that non-oil activities will continue to grow by about 2.7–2.8 per cent in 2016 and 2017. While total GDP growth, at constant prices, is expected to slow to 2.2 per cent in 2016, we project it will regain momentum to 2.4 per cent in 2017, which reflects the aims of the recent fiscal consolidation to strike a balance between growth priorities and ensuring sustainability. According to the Central Bank official, through October 2016 the resilience of the UAE’s banking sector provided the needed financing support thanks to growing deposits and sufficient liquidity in the banking system. Domestic credit grew by 4.9 per cent through end of October 2016, displaying an increase of 5.9 per cent compared to the same period of the previous year, reflecting the adequate liquidity situation at banks and the resiliency of non-oil activities. The Central Bank of the UAE remains keen to increase its capacity to manage liquidity to weather the impacts of external shocks, while adhering to the direction of US interest rate policy. Under these conditions, our focus is on the liquidity needs of banks with a forward-looking agenda. As regulators we need to stay aware of the emerging risks within our financial systems and to set our supervisory priorities. In the sessions, participants will discuss technological innovation in banking - the new players and channels plus enhanced technology innovations in financial market infrastructure and the need for cyber-resilience, the UAE Central Bank official noted. 'We all know that to meet our day to day supervisory responsibilities we need to remain focused, to closely monitor our banks liquidity conditions, asset quality, and risk profiles and we also need to stand ready to use our tool box to support the health of the banking system,' he said. As such the priorities the Central Bank of the UAE’s banking supervision and financial stability continue to shift towards the further enhancement of risk-based supervision processes, and the refinement of our examination process to ensure greater regulatory consistency and transparency, and improve the quality and timeliness of banks’ reporting to the Central Bank. As such our Dashboard report which was launched in mid-2013 continues to evolve and its inputs are fine-tuned with quarterly updates. In addition we are now routinely sharing and openly discussing our Dashboard assessments with our Bank’s most senior management and board members. The Dashboard assessments and general compliance levels are also a formalized and integral part of our approval process for requests coming from our banks While most of our medium-term initiatives are clear, we as regulators need to keep abreast of evolving best practices including the growing importance of establishing strong independent compliance functions within banks, with direct links to the Board of Directors. Strong bank compliance is required for a prudent risk-based supervision processes. 'Through our collaboration efforts, including this high level meeting, we can share our views and open eyes to these emerging or potential risks for financial systems.' The discussions of this high level meeting will further support our capacity to supervise the financial system respective systems’ compliance with best practice, as well as, efforts towards promoting robust financial stability. © Copyright Emirates News Agency (WAM) 2016. © Copyright Zawya.

His Excellency Humaid Al Qatami, Chairman of the Board and Director General of DHA announced that the executive council has approved the implementation of International Refined Diagnosis-Related Group (IR DRG) under resolution No. 21 of 2016 in line with the launch of the third and last phase of the health insurance system ‘Isahd’ (Happiness). Payment by this new system will simplify the payment process, encourages administrative efficiency, and basis payments on patient acuity and hospital resources rather than length of stay. Al Qatami said this step is important to develop health services in Dubai as adopting such a clear pricing method allows hospitals and clinics to provide fair prices it also allows for investment opportunities based on set standards. He added that the executive council decided to adopt the new system after holding a series of meetings with insurance provides and after studying its benefits for two years and benchmarking with best international practices. Dr Haidar Al Yousef, Director of the Health Funding at DHA said the new system also adopts a a statistical system of classifying any inpatient stay into groups for the purposes of payment. The DRG classification system divides possible diagnoses for the purpose of reimbursement with built in incentives for higher quality providers. It also has a medical inflation indicator that caters to increases in cost for the medical sector in collaboration with the Dubai Statistic Center, which can produce indicators of inflation particular to health. Dr Haidar said the new system will be implemented within three years starting 2017 and ending in 2019, in order for the hospitals and clinics to adopt the new system under Esaad seamlessly. The pilot phase with shadow billing will begin in 2017 for hospital accommodation only, and will last till the end of 2017. At the beginning of 2018, all services will be included and the pilot phase for outpatient clinics will began, so that in 2019 the system will be implemented in full effect. Dr Al Yousuf said the system was chosen after an number of evaluations, which proved that it can use the authority’s unified data system. DHA organized a workshop yesterday in partnership with all the concerned parties and strategic partners to familiarize them with the new payment system. -Ends- For further information, please contact: Mahmoud Al Ali  Head of Media Dubai Health Authority  myalali@dha.gov.ae +9714 219 7260 Kamakshi Gupta and Noor Nazzal Communications Analysts- Media Dept.

Keeping the strategic plan in mind, the DHA’s mission is to ensure access to health services, maintain and improve the quality of these services, improve the health status of nationals, residents and visitors and oversee a dynamic, efficient and innovative health sector. In addition to overseeing the health sector for the Emirate of Dubai, the DHA also focuses on providing services through DHA healthcare facilities including hospitals (Latifa, Dubai, Rashid and Hatta), specialty centres (e.g. the Dubai Diabetes Center) and DHA primary health centres spread throughout the Emirate of Dubai. The main pillars of service delivery at DHA health facilities are quality, efficiency, patients and staff.  It is our aim to maintain and improve the quality and efficiency of DHA health services. An important aspect of the service delivery strategy is to focus on patients, their needs and satisfaction as well as attract, retain, nurture and support outstanding staff. Prior to the establishment of the DHA, the Department of Health and Medical Services (DOHMS), which was established in 1973, was the functioning authority that almost exclusively focused on health service delivery. © Press Release 2016 Trending on Zawya Advertisement People In The News 24 Jan 2017 24 Jan 2017 " .

Speaking at the firm’s Annual General Meeting, where the company commemorated its 10-year anniversary, Tarun Khanna, Nexus Group CEO, said the firm posted 20 percent growth across its Employee Benefits and General Insurance businesses in 2016, as well as 50 percent growth in overall gross revenue in its Qatar operations. “Despite what has been a clearly difficult year for the economy, we have been able to record significant achievements thanks to the hard work of our team and growing community-wide awareness about the importance of insurance as a vital protective measure in today’s increasingly unpredictable world,” said Khanna. Advertisement “The industry is witnessing significant regulatory changes, but I believe that this is definitely positive for all stakeholders involved – providers, brokers, and end-users, as it will define the benchmarks of best practice, giving clients the assurance of credible and trustworthy service,” continued Khanna. “As a firm that strives to reach the highest levels of qualification through the continuous training and education of its professionals, we are confident that these changes will continue to offer Nexus opportunities for business development.” Meanwhile, Nexus’ Singapore business – the firm’s first operations outside the Middle East – is also witnessing continuing growth since the group took over the tied agency of Zurich Life Insurance Pte. Ltd (‘Zurich Singapore’) last year. The firm now offers 150 products from more than 15 providers, as well as a wide range of investment platforms through approximately 1600 mutual funds. The products cover an entire range of life, medical, investment, and high net worth products – enabling the firm to provide solutions to its diverse client base across the different segments it operates in. “Our plans for 2016 were based on three pillars: transitioning and stabilizing the advisor force, growing our product portfolio and distribution network, and enhancing our non-organic expansion,” said Gary Harvey, CEO of Nexus Singapore. “I am delighted to announce that we have made progress on all these fronts.” “The Singapore market is large and sophisticated, and we are witnessing a growing trend in which groups of advisors are leaving tied agencies, which are typically tied to certain providers on an exclusive basis, because of their desire to offer clients greater choice,” added Harvey. “This is creating strong market competition – the Financial Advisor market in Singapore has grown by about 20 percent per annum over the last five years, almost doubling in size since 2011, and because of this trend I expect to see even stronger growth in the year ahead as more tied agencies look to transition to an International Financial Advisor model.

Looking at the success stories of international futures markets, we can say with confidence that equity futures will soon rise to become an important segment in the coming years.

Speaking at the Roadshow, Kamal Naji, QFC Authority’s Chief Strategy and Business Development Officer said: “The relationship between Qatar and Japan continues to grow year on year, in 2015 bilateral trade between the two states reached QR 17 billion.  This highlights the close ties between Qatar and Japan. The relationship between Qatar and Japan has traditionally been focused on oil  and  gas, but there are over 45 Japanese companies operating in Qatar and around 1000 Japanese people living and working in Qatar in a wide variety of sectors. Some of our valued Japanese partners are here with us today such as Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, and Fujifilm. This roadshow aims to explain more about Qatar and about how the QFC can be an attractive platform for Japanese companies to expand to Qatar and the Middle East.” Japanese businesses attending the high level event had the opportunity to discuss the outlook for investment in Qatar and the Middle East, and explore how the QFC supports companies to expand to the Middle East. As Japanese corporates and other business enterprises look to reach new markets and propel their regional and international growth, the QFC offers ease of set up and the benefit of 100percent ownership, plus enabling businesses to be fully onshore and deal in any currency whilst being geographically centrally placed between East and West. Manateq’s Chief Planning  and  Business Development Officer, Mohammed Al Malki stated: “Qatar represents a value proposition for international businesses and investors. Fast emerging as an economic hub in the region, the state has established itself as a reliable and secure destination for those looking at the Middle East. Following our meetings and presentation on Qatar’s new Special Economic Zones, we received significant enquiries from our Japanese partners, in addition to interest in the business solutions we provide, offering a positive outlook on the continued relationship between Qatar and Japan’s business communities.” Advertisement Commenting on the Roadshow, Ali Al Neama, Senior Engineer at the Technical Delivery Office, SC, the entity in charge of delivering the infrastructure for the 2022 FIFA World Cup™, said,  “Qatar and Japan have had a long distinguished history of strong economic, social and educational relations, therefore we are grateful to have had an opportunity to share our plans and take part in this panel in Japan, which hosted the World Cup in 2002 and will host the 2020 Olympics, two years prior to Qatar hosting the World Cup. As promised in 2010 when we won the bid, the tournament we are delivering will be for Qatar, the region and for Asia, and we hope to further cooperation in the future.” Speaking at the roadshow, His Excellency Mr. Yousef Mohamed Bilal Ambassador of the State of Qatar to Japan stated during his speech: “This initiative comes as part of efforts to diversify the Qatari economy and transform the country into a leading commercial and financial hub, in line with the Qatar National Vision 2030. We hope that this initiative will provide the opportunity for the Japanese investors to discuss investment prospects in the country, and get acquainted with the support provided by the QFC to the firms to expand globally, and eventually lead to promote the Japanese trade and investment presence in Qatar.” The QFC Asia Roadshow aims to strengthen and further develop bilateral and economic relations between Qatar and Japan, and discuss opportunities to expand in the Middle East through the QFC platform. It comes as part of the QFC’s underlying mission to diversify Qatar’s economy and transform the nation into a leading business and financial hub in line with the Qatar National Vision 2030. The sessions in Tokyo follow the QFC Asia Roadshow’s recent stops in Mumbai and Bangalore.  -Ends- About the Qatar Financial Centre The Qatar Financial Centre (QFC) is an onshore business and financial centre located in Doha, providing an excellent platform for firms to do business in Qatar and the region.

REUTERS/Faisal Al Nasser REUTERS/Faisal Al Nasser 03 December 2016 Total bank deposits in Saudi Arabia increased by SR27.1 billion in October, rising by its fastest pace in 13 months, according to economists. “Our estimate of bank excess liquidity showed a monthly rise of SR13.7 billion, the largest since December 2014,” the economists from Jadwa Investment said in their latest monthly update on Saudi economic activity. “Our estimate of bank excess liquidity showed a monthly rise of SR13.7 billion, the largest since December 2014,” the research team noted in Jadwa Investment’s December Chartbook. The economists noted a rising trend in oil exports during the third quarter of 2016, which has led to an improvement in Saudi Arabia’s trade surplus in recent months. Saudi bank deposits were boosted mainly by a net addition to private sector deposits (SR39.5 billion) as the government resumed payments to contractors, the report added. “We expect a continuation of this growth over the next two months as well. Meanwhile, domestic liquidity conditions have started to ease,” the economists added in the report. It also said that October data showed a mixed picture in economic activity. Data on consumer spending and cement sales and production pointed to a rise in activity, the report added.  Advertisement Meanwhile, the non-oil PMI fell to a new record low. “We expect economic activity to strengthen in the last two months of 2016 as a result of the government resuming its payments. However, downside risks stem from lower growth in bank credit,” Jadwa researchers said in the report. It said that Saudi Consumer Price Index (CPI) slowed for the seventh consecutive month, reaching 2.6 percent, year-on-year in October, its lowest since the start of the year. This slowdown is largely due to a negative contribution from foodstuffs.  Meanwhile, housing and the core index continued to trend downwards, partly impacted by the negative growth in money supply.  “That said, we expect the recent rebound in money supply growth to stabilize the slowing trend in prices,” said the Jadwa economists. According to the report, the monthly change to government accounts with Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) posted a record fall in October, reflecting the resumption of government payments to contractors and other service providers. The majority of this decline came form the government reserve account.  Monthly debt statistics showed that Saudi Arabia’s outstanding debt rose from SR273.8 billion in August to SR342.4 billion in November, according to the report. According to the report, SAMA’s foreign reserve assets fell by $11 billion in October, the third largest decline in 2016. This likely reflects the significant withdrawal from government accounts to resume fiscal spending on the economy before the end of 2016. That said, foreign reserve coverage remains at comfortable levels to finance imports. Bank claims on both the public and private sectors showed slight monthly increases in October, according to the report. Long-term credit maturities continued to contribute only marginally toward overall growth in private sector credit, partly reflecting heightened caution by banks.  “Looking ahead, we expect sentiment to play a greater role in determining the growth in private sector credit,” said the economists. New data on the monthly value of oil exports showed Saudi Arabia earning $96 billion year-to-September in oil export revenue, compared with $128 billion during the same period in 2015. However, a rising trend in oil exports during Q3, coupled with a falling value of imports has led to an improvement in the Kingdom’s trade surplus in recent months, the report added. © Arab News 2016 Trending on Zawya Advertisement People In The News 24 Jan 2017 24 Jan 2017 " .
