The special prosecutor s office did not provide further details immediately on the arrest of NPS Chairman Moon Hyung-pyo but had said on Monday it had raided his home on suspicion of abuse of power. The special prosecutor has been looking into whether Moon pressured the pension fund to support the US$8 billion (6.5 billion pounds) merger last year of two Samsung Group affiliates while he was head of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, which runs the NPS.
